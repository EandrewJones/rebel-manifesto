After the first 100 days, it's time to take stock of the new government. In a minority context where many people believed that the government would be unable to move forward, there was a lot of action. 
On the occasion of the opening speech of the parliamentary session, I claimed that government action was going to rely on four pillars: integrity, prosperity, solidarity and identity. After only three months, Quebec has advanced in each of these areas. 
The Quebec party government has done better to combat corruption in three months than the previous government in nine years. Even before training the government, we have achieved high struggle the creation of the Charbonneau Commission, whose effects are already felt. The fight against corruption sent by the government also gives results. Important changes occurred in Montreal, Laval and Mascouche. 
I am very proud of all that the government team has done in such a short time to restore integrity in Quebec. It can be said, without risk, that Quebec has recovered and that many things have changed since September 4th. 
After months and months of crisis under the former government, Quebec has now found social peace and it feels good. 
Public finances are now under control, and conditions conducive to sustainable prosperity for all are in place. 
Solidarity has regained its rights; The families of the middle class can finally breathe. 
Quebec is regaining confidence and finding hope, and that is the safest way to convince us to become masters from our destiny. I invite Quebeckers to take advantage of the holidays to examine all the way we have traveled together for three months. 
It took barely 100 days to put Quebec back. And our action is just beginning.
