Quebec- The Minister of Natural Resources, Mrs. Martine Ouellet, launched the 15th edition of the Energy Efficiency Week, which runs from 24 to 30 November. On the theme "Energy efficiency, it counts! The aim of the week aims to raise awareness of Quebec and Quebeckers to the importance of energy efficiency. 
"In total, is it $ 665 million that the government has invested in energy efficient programs, never seen! The week is a privileged moment to learn about his stakes and many challenges. By contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency programs make it possible to develop our economy, "said Martine Ouellet. 
Over the past year, the minister has launched several new energy efficiency programs for businesses, municipalities, institutions and the general public. These programs include these: 
"At a time when environmental choices arise at the entire land, Quebec can pave the way and impose itself as a leader in energy efficiency. Major investments made over the past year in this area show the government's willingness to occupy a leading place in the new green economy. By ensuring the implementation of these programs, we contribute to "Verdir" Quebec, in addition to stimulating energy innovation, "said Martine Ouellet.
