Quebec - Member for Taschereau and sentence of the official health opposition, Agnès Maltese, revealed this morning at the National Assembly that 235,000 Quebeckers could now have access to a family doctor if the government Liberal had acted to prevent physicians from disengageing from the public health system. 
"In 2004, there were 79 doctors who were disengaged from the public health plan. Today, there are 251. Of these, 157 are family physicians. If the Minister of Health had acted to prevent these family physicians from leaving home, it's 235,000 more Quebeckers who would have free access to a family doctor, "said Agnès Maltais during the question period. 
The Parti Québécois is concerned about the techniques deployed by private health clinics to attract customers. "We suggest, by means of an advertising, that one can offer a loved one a doctor as a Christmas present. Quebeckers do not have to wait for Santa to have access to a doctor! If we have returned there, it's because the government does nothing to bring doctors back into the public health system or to prevent them from growing the ranks of the private. It's not only disturbing, it's unacceptable, "she added. 
In addition, the member for Taschereau emphasized that several investigations conducted by the Quebec Health Insurance Régie are slow to succeed and involve private clinics that charge access to a doctor. "Since 18 months, it has been impatiently awaited the result of three investigations involving the Montreal Plexo Clinic, which has the co-founder of the CAQ and friend of François Legault, Charles Sirois. There is also the case of the Medisys Clinic 123 and that of the Physihed clinic. In short, not clarifying what is legal and illegal, what interests does the Yves Bolduc protects? "Agnès Maltais concluded.
