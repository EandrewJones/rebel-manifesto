Quebec, on July 8, 2016 - As it lost 27,400 full-time jobs in June, the official Leader of the official and MP, Sylvain Gaudreault, the spokesman for the Parti Québécois Finance and Income, Nicolas Marceau, Spokesperson in Economics, Alain Therrien, and the Job Spokesperson, Dave Turcotte, urged the Prime Minister to act for employment and development Quebec's economic. 
"We have before us a flawed government? Straps who congratulated last month, will he react with the same energy when he lost 2,400 full-time jobs? We have witnessed many deployment ads in recent months, but nothing in these was not concrete for employment and economic development. Smoke screens have become the great specialty of this government. Workers and regions need more than empty ads, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
"Since the arrival of the Liberals, we have experienced austerity, the budget cuts, the increase in taxes and taxes and job creation is anemic. The Prime Minister's promise to create 250,000 jobs is a myth that is confirmed by months in months. The Liberals have cheaply lied to Quebeckers, "added Nicolas Marceau. 
"Quebec's economic development is down. Very few ways are announced by the government, besides beautiful major policies unveiled in great pomp, such as energy policy and digital strategy, to name only those. There is nothing concrete to support our businesses and entrepreneurs, our SMEs, those who create jobs in all regions of Quebec, "sued Alain Therien. 
"Austerity and budget cuts in all sectors hurt the economy. Quebec workers continue to lose their jobs. The confidence of Quebeckers to this government is zero. A real economic policy, with clear and concrete goals, must be put in place as quickly as possible, "concluded Dave Turcotte.
