Montreal- "The election campaign is old only four days and already the job loss record is impressive: 360 workers have lost their jobs since last Wednesday. On the day of the trip, the Novelis company closed its doors throwing the street 160 workers from Saguenay. Yesterday, the Paccar factory of Sainte-Thérèse announced the layoff of 200 workers in the greatest indifference of the Liberal government. Jean Charest should be ashamed to claim the champion of the economy in front of such a report, "said Quebec's candidate in the riding riding, Nicolas Marceau. 
"Jean Charest has just demonstrated that the economy is a priority than in his speeches and not in his actions. These 360 workers lost their jobs in the greater indifference of the Prime Minister more concerned about his re-election than by the fate of these families. In addition, at the same time, Jean Charest promised at the same time to create 250,000 jobs by copying the projections of a 2011 Québec-Québec job report, a shortly qualified promise by many, "added Nicolas Marceau. . 
The Québécois Party candidate in Groulx, Raymond Archambault, stated that in 1999, the government of the Parti Québécois had managed to save the jobs of the Paccar factory workers by his muscular interventions. "A government of the Parti Québécois will make every effort to preserve the jobs of Paccar workers, unlike liberal indifference. If he really wanted to be a champion of the economy, Jean Charest would meet the expectations of PACCAR employees and their families. » 
"From 1998 to 2003, the Parti Québécois government contributed to the creation of 362,000 jobs, including 124,000 in 2002, while Pauline Marois was Minister of Finance," concluded Nicolas Marceau.
