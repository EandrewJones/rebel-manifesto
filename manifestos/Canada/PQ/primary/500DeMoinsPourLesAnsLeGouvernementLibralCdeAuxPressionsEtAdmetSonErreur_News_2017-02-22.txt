Quebec, February 22, 2017- In the tax credit file for the most vulnerable seniors, the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in the field of finance, Nicolas Marceau, and the spokesperson for the elders, Harold Lebel, Rejoice that the government has finally heard reason and admitted its mistake. Indeed, the age to have access will be maintained at 65 years. 
"After denied the problem for two years, Minister Leitão finally admits that his decision affects thousands of people; Faced with the mobilization of seniors, supported by the Parti Québécois, he finally renounces cutting this financial assistance. Indeed, since 2015, we argued the Liberal government about the harmful and predictable impacts of its decision. Today's announcement illustrates the contempt of the government for the population; Once again, he did not measure the consequences of his despicable cuts. Obviously, no impact analysis had been conducted on the effects of a $ 500 puncture in the most vulnerable pocket, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
"It always needs to turn in crisis before this government decides to listen to the population. The Liberals have once again attacked elders, regardless of the harmful consequences. Even today, even announcing that it will not finally affect the tax credit, the minister has shown arrogance by suggesting that the real problem, it was not the measure itself, but the fact that seniors did not understand it; In short, it would be a simple communication problem. It is a total lack of respect for people who have built Quebec. More sad, during all this debate, where was the minister responsible for seniors? Nowhere. We did not hear it once. Once again, she refused to get up to defend the elders of Quebec, "added Harold Lebel. 
"Today, it is a victory for the elders of Quebec who mobilized to denounce this unacceptable measure. The Parti Québécois will continue to show extreme vigilance to protect the interests of Quebecers, "concluded members.
