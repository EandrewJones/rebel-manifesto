Qu√©bec- The Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and the Occupation of the Territory and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, congratulates the Order of Planners for its 50 years of active contribution to the development of Quebec. This half-century of history was marked by great changes such as the Law on Development and Urbanism, the creation of regional county municipalities and, more recently, the adoption of metropolitan planning and development plans in Montreal and Quebec City. 
"At a time when urban densification, collective transport, urban sprawl and sustainable mobility are part of the new reality, I invite the Order of the planners of Quebec to define, with our government, an innovative vision of the Development and, ricochet, a new modern and avant-garde law, "said the minister. 
The profession of urban planner in the 21st century is more than ever in an innovative North American current. Nowadays, it is essential to achieve integrated planning that takes into account the characteristics of natural and built environments while promoting the harmonization of activities and spatial planning to meet the needs of citizens and to offer them a better quality of life 
"I want to emphasize the invaluable intake of planners to Quebec's development which, every day, take advantage of their knowledge and vision in order to ensure the sustainability of Quebec territory," said Gaudreault.
