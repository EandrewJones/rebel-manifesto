65 years ago today, Quebec discovered its flag. It was the birth of the most beautiful symbols of our identity as a people, a symbol around which all Quebeckers can meet and all Quebeckers, regardless of their beliefs, their origins, their political choices. It's a flag for all of us. 
Our flag is a representation of what we are. He speaks on our behalf every day, all over the world. He testifies to our values and achievements. If we are proud to wear its colors, it is because together, we form a great nation, which has the firm desire to build a better society. A people ready to meet the challenges of the future. 
I ask you to act as ambassadors as soon as you carry the Quebec flag. This symbol of our identity must continue to project our values: those of a society open to the world, of a nation capable of tightening the elbows when it is necessary, a people of Francophones of America who knew how to invite All languages and cultures to coexist within it. 
As a premier, I believe that the role of a government is not only to protect and define our identity. We must also commemorate the important moments of our history. That's why, from now on January 21 of each year, we will emphasize the day of the flag. 
Today, we pay tribute to our flag with all the respect it deserves. When the flowering beats so proudly from the top of our parliament, it is the heart of our nation that beats. When he rises, high and majestic, it's us that he represents so dignity. 
Under this flag that we Hissa for the first time 65 years ago, we developed modern Quebec and we will build Quebec tomorrow.
