"The multiplication of the structures proposed by the Minister Poëti would violate the law and politicized collective transit decisions in the metropolitan area," Martine Ouellet said. 
In its fall 2013 report on the Governance of the AMT, the Auditor General of Quebec recommended that the number of independent members sit on the board of directors be increased. This same report was analyzed last November by the Public Administration Commission of the National Assembly. The first recommendation of his report took over that of the Auditor General. 
"The Minister goes against a recommendation from the Auditor General and a decision of the Public Administration Commission last November, yet voted by a majority by liberal elected representatives. While Vancouver and Toronto depoliate as much as possible their collective planning and management organizations, in order to give way to the experts in the field, the Liberal Minister is politicizing decisions. Even worse, the minister is not even able to commit to that this multiplication of structures does not cause increased rates for users, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
