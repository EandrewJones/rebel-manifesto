Quebec- The member for Vachon and sentence of the official transport in terms of transport, Martine Ouellet, is concerned about the decision of the Liberal government to abolish the Metropolitan Transport Agency (AMT) to replace it with two entities , the network of metropolitan transport and the regional transport agency. 
"This decision is really surprising. Indeed, while several cities in the world have a tendency to centralize the planning and management of collective transport around one and the same organization, the Liberal government decides to replace a structure with two structures. There are already too many players in this file; I do not see how creating a new organization and merging others will simplify things. For us, it is only a musical chair game between stakeholders. The government has no real, long-term vision of collective transportation in the metropolitan area, "said Martine Ouellet. 
In addition, the new configuration would give more power to the metropolitan community of Montreal, which means more power for Montreal, but less to the cities on the outskirts. This new way of making greater political transit decisions in the great metropolitan area. 
"Once again, the decision of the Minister of Transport goes against the trends that are observed elsewhere in the world. In Vancouver and Toronto, for example, collective transportation planning and management organizations have been depolised to allow all space to experts in this area, ensuring long-term network planning. Not only does the liberal reorganization politics the decision-making process, but it creates an obvious imbalance between Montreal and other cities in the metropolitan area, "the hon. Member.
