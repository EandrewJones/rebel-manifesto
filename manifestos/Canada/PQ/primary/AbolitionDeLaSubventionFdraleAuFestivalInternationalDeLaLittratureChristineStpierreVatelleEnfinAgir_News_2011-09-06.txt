Montreal - "I am absolutely outlet to learn that the Conservative government is pursuing its ideological offensive against Quebec in the field of culture, by refusing this time to subsidize the Montreal International Literature Festival! , "Said the member for Bourget and the official opposition spokeswoman in culture and communications, Maka Kotto. 
"What will the Quebec Minister of Culture do, Christine St-Pierre, in front of this new affront of the Conservative government to Quebec culture, his craftsmen and his creators? Will she finally understand what's going on and acting accordingly? What does he need more? , "Added Maka Kotto. 
"The very admission of his organizers, without this grant, which represents 13% of the budget of the event, the survival of the festival is now mortgaged. This decision is all the more difficult to swallow that neither officials nor the Cabinet of the Minister of Canadian Heritage, James Moore, have deigned to explain the reasons for their choice to the organizers of the event. This is a purely ideological decision, "said the member for Bourget. 
"This Ottawa decision shows us once again that the Conservatives are royally mocking Quebec culture. Faced with them and a minister who abdicked his responsibilities in this area, the Parti Québécois is the only party who proposes to act by repatriating in particular in Quebec all the powers and budgets in the field of culture and communications currently detained. By Ottawa, "concluded Maka Kotto.
