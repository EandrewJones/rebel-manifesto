Quebec - Member for Taillon and sentence of the official opposition in higher education, Marie Malavoy, totally reject François Legault's proposal to abolish CEGEPs. 
"By abolishing CEGEPs, François Legault wants to harm the accessibility of studies and harm the regions of Quebec," Marie Malavoy said. 
She regrets that Mr. Legault conveys a prejudice to the effect that CEGEPs are places inciting drug use and that in this case it would have to abolish them. 
"We must not trivialize this issue of drug use among our young people, but it is certainly not by abolishing the CEGEPs that the drug will disappear! The time is not at structural brewing, but to the academic success of our children, "she concluded.
