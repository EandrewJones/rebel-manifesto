Québec- The member for Taillon and spokesman for the Quebecois health and accessibility of care, Diane Lamarre, denounced the threats brandished by the doctors, who will finally be obliged to absorb their remuneration the expenses Accessories illegally invoiced to patients for insured services. "We are scandalized by the blackmail of doctors who threaten to stop treating people," she first declared. 
"Doctors take patients hosting by threatening to no longer offer certain services. Gaétan Barrette himself, while he was president of a doctors' union, has already used this tactic, by the way. It is unacceptable and unworthy of their fundamental duty to Quebecers. The incidental fees that they should stop incorrectly billing to patients can very well be assumed by their remuneration, since this represents less than 1% of their $ 7 billion annual envelope. Do we need to remind the doctors that they have affected carameous remuneration increases over the last 10 years, to the point not only to catch up with the doctors of other provinces, but to overcome them? , Continued the spokesperson. 
"With gigantic salary increases that doctors have had, it is indecent to make such a blackmail. Listen to Madame Francoeur, the FMSQ President, Centraide should be called to help them or organize fundraising. It's incredible! These threats, on the part of doctors, are simply scandalous. Imagine: they dare to say to the patients they will have to stop treating them, under the pretext that they will no longer be able to take their pockets the millions they charge them illegally ", has concluded Diane Lamarre.
