Montreal- The member and candidate of the Québécois Party of Gouin, Nicolas Girard, questions the position of the Coalition Future Québec (CAQ) in terms of parliamentary ethics. "We are pleased to see that the CAQ adheres to certain proposals from the Parti Québécois such as the fixed-date ballot, the creation of the position of Parliamentary Director of the Budget at the National Assembly and the decrease in funding to political parties at 100 dollars. However, it is strange to note that the CAQ is silent about our position on the cancellation of the members' pension in the event of a resignation during the mandate. Does this silence mean that the CAQ wants to maintain pensions to the resigning, as is the case of the liberals partisans of the status quo in this file? Nicolas Girard wondered. 
"The Parti Québécois believes that it is the responsibility of the citizens to participate in democracy, notably by voting massively, but in return, the elected officials should have the moral obligation to supplement their mandate. Otherwise, they should not be entitled to the same benefits as those who did it, "believes the member for Gouin. 
"The silence of the CAQ gives the impression that this party does not care about the work ethics of MPs, but only issues related to funding. For the Parti Québécois, the cleaning of our democracy must be done in all its aspects. François Legault must rectify this situation and take a position, whether or not our proposal, "concluded Nicolas Girard.
