Quebec- The member for Berthier and sentence of the official opposition in agriculture, fisheries and food, André Villeneuve, is pleased that members of the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries, Energy and natural resources will hear stakeholders affected by speculation and the purchase of agricultural land by private investment firms. This party proposal has indeed been accepted this morning. 
"Private investment firms, including the firm Pangea, led by Charles Sirois, the CAQ co-founder, covet agricultural land in several regions of Quebec. This speculation leads to higher the value of these lands, making access even more difficult for succession. The agricultural world is worried - young farmers, including - about the impacts of private firms actions. It is important to hear the stakeholders affected by this issue, "said André Villeneuve. 
"Agriculture is a very important economic sector for the regions of Quebec. How can young farmers hope for a future, while increasingly acquiring agricultural land can only be done at a price exceeding their means? The government must work with environmental players to find sustainable solutions, especially for succession. Thanks to the Parti Québécois, solution tracks can be formulated directly to parliamentarians, "concluded André Villeneuve.
