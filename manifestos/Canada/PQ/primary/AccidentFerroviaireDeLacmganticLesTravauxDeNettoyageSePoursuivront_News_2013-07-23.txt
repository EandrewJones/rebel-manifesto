Quebec - The Government of Quebec wishes to reiterate that it will accompany the city of Lac-Mégantic in all the coming stages, including the continuation of the cleaning work as a result of the railway accident. Last July 6. 
Remember that service providers engaged by the Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway Company (MMA) were notified by the City of Lac-Mégantic that the latter had the necessary powers to make sure they will be paid if MMA lacked his obligations. 
A formal notice was transmitted to MMA by the city to remind him of his responsibilities. The Government hopes that MMA will act as an exemplary corporate citizen and will comply with the demands of the City of Lac-Mégantic. 
The Government considers that the population of Lac-Mégantic, already largely proven, does not have to bear the consequences of possible failures. "If the MMA company lacked its obligations, the City of Lac-Mégantic may request the Government of Quebec the reimbursement of the amounts it will pay to MMA suppliers, which will be eligible for a 100% repayment under the program. Specific financial assistance adopted by the Government of Quebec on July 10, "said Minister of Public Safety, Stéphane Bergeron.
