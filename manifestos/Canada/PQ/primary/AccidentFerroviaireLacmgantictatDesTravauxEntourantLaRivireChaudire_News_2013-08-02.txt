Québec - almost four weeks after the railway accident in Lac-Mégantic, the Ministry of Sustainable Development, the Environment, Wildlife and Parks (MDDEFP) wishes to take stock of the work ongoing along the work. Chaudière River. 
The Ministry does not observe virtually more traces of hydrocarbons on the surface of the water. On the other hand, for preventive measure, the many stacks, which serve as floating dams, are kept in place in order to recover any amount of oil that could emerge during the recovery work. 
In addition, the Ministry maintains the monitoring of the water quality of the river to adequately advise municipalities that must feed alternative water intakes, Saint-Georges, Sainte-Marie and Lévis. Only traces of contaminants are detected, and the analyzes will continue until the use of this water no longer has a health risk. 
In addition, the MDDEFP continues the verification of the state of the banks. To date, more than 100 kilometers were estimated on a total of 180. This evaluation is used to lead the cleaning teams where the banks were soiled. Indeed, many teams are busy cleaning the banks already evaluated. Currently, more than sixty people are responsible for doing this work. 
Finally, it should be noted that the preliminary checks made by the ministry make it possible to conclude that oil would have been deposited in part of the Fund of the Chaudière River. MDDEFP scientists and the Department of Natural Resources will act in concert to analyze the results obtained as a result of field verifications. They will also formulate opinions on the consequences of this contamination, on areas requiring intervention and cleaning methods to be adopted. 
Thus, all the necessary work is made to clean up this watercourse that has its source in the Mégantic Lake. The whole workforce and equipment required are involved in order to achieve the best results as soon as possible.
