Quebec- The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and sentence of the official opposition in the field of justice, Alexandre Cloutier, is pleased that the Minister of Justice, St√©phanie Valley, finally decided to entrust the evaluation of the file of The deadly accident involving a police officer of Quebec to independent attorneys. 
"It's a good decision that, we hope to help preserve the confidence of the population to our justice system. It was essential that an external eye looks at the file, especially because of the many cakes that characterized it, "said Alexandre Cloutier, who asked for such intervention by the minister since last week. 
The member offers all his collaboration and that of his political training on future legislative changes regarding the Director of Criminal and Criminal Prosecutions (PPCP) and independence. 
Alexandre Cloutier wishes, in particular, that henceforth, when a policeman is involved in a serious or mortal accident and that no accusation is brought against him, the PCPP systematically justifies the reasons for its decision. "It is absolutely necessary to avoid that a situation like that, where parents must fight with the system to obtain simple explanations, reproduces in the future," concluded the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
