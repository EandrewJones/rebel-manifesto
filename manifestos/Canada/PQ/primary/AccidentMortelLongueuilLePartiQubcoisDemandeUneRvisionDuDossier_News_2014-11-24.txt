Quebec- Following the press conference, last Friday, the Director of Criminal and Criminal Prosecutions (PCDP) about the fatal accident in Longueuil and involving a police officer of Quebec (SQ), the member for Lac-Saint-Jean and official opposition spokesman, Alexandre Cloutier, demands again from the Minister of Justice, Stephanie Valley, which she orders the revision of the file by an independent prosecutor. 
"Now that it has the version of the PCPP and that the Prime Minister did not exclude the revision of the file, will the Minister Valley act? Important questions are raised, and the PPCP press conference has provided further evidence that the intervention of an independent prosecutor is needed to revise the file. The credibility of the judicial system is at stake, "said Alexandre Cloutier. 
The hon. Member recalls that last Wednesday, based on Articles 23 and 24 of the Act respecting the Director of Criminal and Criminal Prosecutions, the official opposition personally arrested the minister on this case, asking him to intervene. 
"It happened several cakes in this file. First, the DPCP did not inform the parents of his decision on criminal prosecution; These are the investigators of the SQ that did it. Then, the parents were forced out publicly to get answers. The DPCP then took several days before meeting them, finally. And this morning, the main eyewitness contradicts the PCPP on the responsibility of the policeman. It is therefore clearly time that an independent revision is made, "concluded Alexander Cloutier.
