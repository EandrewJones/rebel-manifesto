Quebec - following the vote on the approval of the Global Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union (EU), the Leader of the Official Opposition, Jean-François Lisée, the Porte- Word in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, and the spokesperson for international relations, Stéphane Bergeron, have denounced Liberal and Caquist, that is to say the PLCAQ, for their abandonment of producers and Quebec cheesers. 
IN SHORT 
"Overall, the AECG will be beneficial for our exporting SMEs and our entire economy, there is no doubt about it. However, before approving it officially, Quebec had to wait to know the details of the compensation program for cheese makers. The federal government had accepted the principle. But he did not meet any resistance on the part of the PLQ and the CAQ, who said yes without knowing the program, without any condition. The PLCAQ decided to sign a blank check in Ottawa, at the expense of our producers. He dropped off the federal government's balance that the Quebec party government had established, "said Jean-François Lisée. 
"When the federal government decided to sacrifice our dairy industry in exchange for Western Canada, our government had demanded and obtained formal insurance that Quebec cheesers would receive full compensation from Ottawa. However, the Liberal government has just given its acceptance, while compensation promises to be insufficient and in addition, it does not even know the details, "added André Villeneuve. 
"I denounce the rejection by the Liberals and the Caquists of my motion of postponement. We could have, thus, give time to the federal government to fulfill its commitment in whole. The evaluation of the impacts for our dairy industry, our cheese industry is of the order of $ 1.5 billion, and the proposed compensation is far away. Account. The Liberal government and CAQ deputies knowingly abandoned our producers, there is nothing to add, "concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
