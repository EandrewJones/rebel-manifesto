Forestville- The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, accompanied by the member for René-Lévesque and head of the North Shore, Marjolan Dufour region, announced a principle agreement of $ 1,657,000 for the draft Renovation of the auditorium of the versatile river. 
"This structuring project will contribute to energizing the arts and shows in Forestville. I am proud to conclude today the agreement in principle that today demonstrates the importance that the Quebec government gives access to quality cultural equipment to our fellow citizens and citizens on the whole of the national territory, "said Minister Kotto. 
"This boost of our government will ensure the continuity of an essential cultural dissemination place that has made the happiness of two generations of North Coastal and North Coastal," added Marjolan Dufour. 
Currently, the project aims at the complete renovation of the auditorium of the versatile river and the purchase of equipment to ensure its vocation to disseminate arts and culture. 
The department's contribution is part of the 2013-2023 Infrastructure Plan, released in April. Recall that this ten-year plan will eventually result in $ 2 billion investments for the cultural component. It will have a major economic impact throughout Québec, with nearly 60,000 jobs created or maintained, on average, per year. This new way of doing things will make it possible to evaluate the needs, according to the priorities of Quebeckers, to measure the associated costs and to make informed choices. The City of Forestville and the Estuary School Board also contribute to the financing of the project.
