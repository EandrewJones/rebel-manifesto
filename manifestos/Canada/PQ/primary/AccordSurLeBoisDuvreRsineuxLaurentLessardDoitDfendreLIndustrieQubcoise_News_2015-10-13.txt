Qu√©bec- It is yesterday that the resinous lumber agreement between Canada and the United States ended ended. As a result, the Quebec market is now in a period of free trade for one year, pending a possible renegotiation. It is in this context that the member for Bonaventure and spokesperson for the Quebecois Forest Party, Sylvain Roy, invites the Minister of Forests, Laurent Lessard, to defend the Quebec wood industry. 
"The Quebec forest economy can not afford a new timber war. The transition year that begins represents a period of uncertainty for the industry. Minister Lessard must reassure workers, who are likely to suffer from the instability of the market. He also has the duty to put pressure for the competitiveness of the new forest regime and, thus, to avoid the introduction of tariffs by the Americans, "said Sylvain Roy. 
It should be noted that negotiations for a renewal of the agreement are not even started with the United States. "Laurent Lessard must ensure that the Government of Canada quickly begins negotiations with the Americans to renew the agreement. It must also ensure that the Federal takes into account the needs of Quebec exporters. Prior to the 2006 agreement, small exporters from Quebec had to leave the market because of the taxes and quotas imposed by the Americans. This situation should not reproduce, "concluded the member.
