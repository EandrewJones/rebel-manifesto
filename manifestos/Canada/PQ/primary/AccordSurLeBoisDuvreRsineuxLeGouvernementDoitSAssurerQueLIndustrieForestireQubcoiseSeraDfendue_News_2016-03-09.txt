Quebec- The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on forests, Sylvain Roy, as well as the spokesperson for municipal affairs and decentralization, and responsible for the region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Sylvain Gaudreault, Request the government of Philippe Couillard to emphasize the federal government so that the position of the Quebec forest industry be defended when negotiating a new resinous timber agreement with the United States. 
"The previous agreement has been much more favorable for Western Canada than for Quebec. When conflicts have occurred, the federal government has always refused to work in the interest of the Quebec industry, and it is our workers and our regions that have suffered, "said Sylvain Roy. 
He also pointed out that the Softwood Lumber Agreement has expired since October 2015. "The Government of Quebec must constantly emphasize the federal government, since it is Canada that will negotiate on our behalf. The statements of the Federal Minister of International Trade, Chrystia Freeland, worry, because it does not seem to want to defend the Quebec industry, yet struck of hard work more than once. Let us remember that taxes on overcut paper and other charges arising from the agreement have lost jobs in Quebec, "he added. 
As for Sylvain Gaudreault, he wanted to defend workers in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. "Yesterday morning, the workers launched a heart cry. According to them, the regional forest industry will soon be in the terminal phase if nothing is done. I ask the Prime Minister, Member of Parliament for Roberval, to give an electroshock to help this important industry for our regions. The budget will be tabled next week; It must include a strong will and concrete measures for our forest workers who have lost their jobs or who are in a precarious situation, "he concluded.
