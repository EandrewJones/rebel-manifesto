Quebec- While the possibility of a denouement in the compensation file for our milk and cheese producers seems to be clarified, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Paradis, must give them Answers, consider the official opposition spokespersons in Agriculture, André Villeneuve, and Finance, Nicolas Marceau. They also say that the Liberal government must commit not to ratify the CETA if there is no agreement, between Ottawa and the producers of milk and cheese, on a fair compensation. 
"The government must give the time just on those who are waiting for the conclusion of the negotiations with the federal government. Can the minister confirm that there is an agreement and, if necessary, specify what are the terms and conditions? It is rather worrying that the minister himself can confirm the denouement of the discussions, "said the member for Berthier, André Villeneuve. 
Recall that according to the CETA, more than 17,000 tonnes of European cheese could enter the Canadian and Quebec markets. The shortfall of Quebec producers must be compensated and the entry of European cheese into the market, spread over time. 
"The economic and commercial agreement will allow Quebec to position itself as a leading partner and to combine its efforts to increase the export of Quebec companies. The question of cheese remains very important; The government should not ask Parliamentarians of the National Assembly the ratification of CETA without a satisfactory agreement for our producers of milk and cheese, "concluded the member for Rousseau, Nicolas Marceau.
