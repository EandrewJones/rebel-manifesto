Quebec, March 10, 2020 - The hon. Member for Rimouski, Harold Lebel, as well as the members of Eas-du-Québec, accompanied by elected representatives of citizens and members of the medical profession of the region, have launched a cry of the Heart to the Minister of Health and Social Services, Danielle McCann: In order to properly and equitably the citizens of East-du-Québec, a hemodynamic room must be converted to the Regional Hospital of Rimouski. 
IN SHORT 
Hemodynamics is a technique for unblocking the arteries of the heart in case of infarction, so limiting the damage. "Every year, more than 1400 Eas-du-Québec patients use this type of care. To do this, they must go to Quebec City. Some, too unstable, die during the transfer; Others will live with permanent sequelae, due to intervention times. And for all patients, it is an untenable and inequitable location. While seven regions of Quebec benefit from a hemodynamic service, Patients at Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspésie face stress, away from discomfort. The government must intervene, "said Harold Lebel. 
It should be noted that on many occasions, a compound of cardiologists and citizens has proven that the region meets all conditions to obtain a hemodynamic service. Many reports and records presented at the Ministry of Health and Social Services (MSSS) demonstrate. 
"The CAQ often affirms that regions have an important role to play in the development and prosperity of Quebec. However, to occupy the territory, adequate health services must be offered in all regions. In East-du-Québec, it is consensus: we need a haemadenamic room. This is a question of equity for the population, and the government must take it into account, "the member insisted.
