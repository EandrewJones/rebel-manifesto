Quebec -The MP for Chambly and official opposition spokesperson for access to information, Bertrand St-Arnaud, introduced this morning to the National Assembly Bill 590 which aims to Exclude the obligation to be represented by a lawyer before the Access to Information Commission. This bill aims to add the Access to Information Commission to the Exceptions already provided for in the Bar. This amendment to the law will allow journalists to represented themselves before the Access to Information Commission. 
Nearly 30 years ago, Quebec has a law on access to information that ensures that any person has a right of access to the documents of a public body under the conditions laid down in the law. "There can be two categories of persons before the Access to Information Commission and the legislature's intention has always been to enable anyone to ask the Commission to revise a decision from a public body and to represent himself. The law must facilitate the right of access and not limiting it, "said the member. 
"I invite the government to adopt this bill by the end of parliamentary work on December 9," concluded the member.
