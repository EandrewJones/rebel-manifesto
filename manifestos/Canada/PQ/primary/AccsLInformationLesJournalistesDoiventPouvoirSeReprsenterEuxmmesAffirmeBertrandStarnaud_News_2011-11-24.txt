Quebec - the member for Chambly and the official opposition spokesperson for access to information, Bertrand St-Arnaud, intervened this morning at the question period at the National Assembly to demand the Liberal government a Amendment to the law allowing journalists to represent themselves before the Access to Information Commission. 
"The current situation does not make sense. A journalist, unlike a simple citizen, can not even present himself during a request for review to the Access to Information Commission. It must absolutely be represented by a lawyer. The result is a slowdown in the process and many fees that bring many journalists to give up their request for review, depriving the public of his right to information. It is totally absurd and contrary to the spirit of the law. It's aberrant and this situation must stop quickly! "Said the hon. Member. 
"30 years ago, Quebec has a law of access to information that guarantees a fundamental right: access to documents from public bodies. The amendment we ask is quite simple, the Access to Information Commission must be included in cases where lawyer representation is not mandatory. There can not be two categories of citizens before the Access to Information Commission, the mere citizen and the journalist, "he continued. 
"The answer of Minister Valli√®res to my question is inadmissible. It postpones several years the settlement of a situation clearly contrary to the spirit of the law that is supposed to promote access to documents, not limiting it. We can not wait for the next reform of the Public Agency Access Act and on the protection of personal information to act, "added Bertrand St-Arnaud. 
"There is urgency to change the law. The government can count on our entire collaboration to put an end to this drift before the postponement of parliamentary work on December 9, "concluded the member.
