Quebec- The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and the official opposition for the court, Alexandre Cloutier, as well as the member for Saint-Jérôme and spokesperson in the area of economy, entrepreneurship, of SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, ask the Minister of the Economy, Jacques Daoust, not to interfere in the judicial process concerning SNC-Lavalin. 
"By his remarks, Jacques Daoust exceeded the limit; He does not have to lead the police or the Attorney General. There is a difference between the reimbursement of the sums with Bill 26 and the criminal charges filed yesterday for fraud and corruption. Bill 26 allows firms to settle in civil, while criminal charges are much more serious; The minister knows it very well! ", Supported Alexander Cloutier. 
"Minister Daoust, saying that the law must be at two speeds, sends a very heavy message of consequences. It is unacceptable that it suggests that a company should be able to buy a total civilian receipt and spare criminal prosecution. If criminal acts have been committed, charges must be filed. We remember Jacques Daoust that this is the prerogative of the Attorney General. The minister must be explained immediately, "added the member for Lac-Saint-Jean. 
"Jacques Daoust, rather than commenting on the work of prosecutors and police, should focus on what it will do to support the activities of SNC-Lavalin's head office and its 5,000 employees," concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
