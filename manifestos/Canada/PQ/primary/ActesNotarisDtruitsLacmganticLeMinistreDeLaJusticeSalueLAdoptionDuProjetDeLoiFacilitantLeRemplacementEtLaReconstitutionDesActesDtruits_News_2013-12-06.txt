"With the adoption of this bill, we will have a lighter and diversed proceeding of replacement and reconstruction of acts, to meet the needs of our fellow citagians. It will allow us to avoid the appeal to the Tribunal to replace and reconstruct each of the acts, which would have unnecessarily unnecessary our system of justice and would have been contrary to the public interest, "said Minister Bertrand St-Arnaud. 
Remember that 12 transplants were destroyed as a result of the rail tragedy of July 6, resulting in the loss of nearly 100,000 notarial acts: marriage contracts, wills, mandates in case of incapacity, mortgages, purchasing proceedings. or sale of property, etc. 
Thanks to the adoption of Bill 65, new more flexible rules will ensure that acts destroyed by Lac-Mégantic may be replaced by inserting the Registry of an authentic copy of original value. In cases where replacement will not be possible, the notary may proceed with its reconstruction, but only as a result of a request from a party or a third party concerned. 
The Chamber of Notaries of Quebec will coordinate this field operation and ensure that the population's public awareness for this purpose.
