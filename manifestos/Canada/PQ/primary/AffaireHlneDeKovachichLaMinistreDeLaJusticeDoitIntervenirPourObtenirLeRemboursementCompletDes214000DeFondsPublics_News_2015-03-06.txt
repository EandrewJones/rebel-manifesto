Quebec- The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and the official opposition for the court, Alexandre Cloutier, requires the full repayment of the $ 214,000 of public funds used for personal purposes by the ex-judge. Quebec Administrative Court (TAQ), Hélène de Kovachich. To do this, he claims the intervention of the Minister of Justice, Stephanie Valley. 
It should be remembered that on December 5, 2014, the Parti Québécois filed a motion requiring the government that it initiates the approaches to recover the full public funds used by the former judge to defend himself in a personal case. The government then refused to support this motion. 
The Minister of Justice must raise government advice on public funds engulfed in this case. In its report of the year 2013-2014, the Auditor General of Quebec explicitly recommended that the Government be an opinion on the relevance, for the TAQ, to cover, through public funds, the costs of Kovachich's lawyer in his personal case, and document the decision taken. 
"One year after the submission of the Auditor General's report and three months after the deposit of our motion, what did the Minister of Justice do? Has it issued a government opinion? Did she follow up diligent with the TAQ to implement the Auditor General's recommendations quickly? The minister has the duty to ensure the good administration of justice, which includes administrative justice. In this era of austerity for all Quebeckers, the government must position itself without delay on the management of public funds, "said Alexandre Cloutier. 
Remember that the November 2014 report of the Administrative Justice Council concluded that the conduct of Hélène de Kovachich was likely to undermine the trust and respect of the public with regard to the TAQ, its leaders and, more generally, administrative justice. "It is fundamental that the minister has a government opinion so that all public funds are recovered, with respect for the population," concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
