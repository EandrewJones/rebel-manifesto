Quebec- The member for Chambly and sentence of the official opposition in terms of public security, Bertrand St-Arnaud, asks the Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, to appoint an independent investigator to make all the light on the Ian Davidson case. 
"This case involving a former police officer of the City of Montreal (SPVM) raises extremely troubling questions and every day brings us a lot of new revelations. Public confidence is shaken and it is important to shed light on everything that has been in this case since that day of April 2011 when the SPVM learned that an individual was trying to cash the highly confidential list of his informants "Said Bertrand St-Arnaud. 
For the Parti Québécois, too many sensitive and important questions must get a response quickly. "What did the SPVM doing in this file between April and October 2011, when Ian Davidson was intercepted as he was about to fly to Costa Rica? Why was not he arrested while we knew he had information that could put the lives of hundreds of people in danger? What are the discussions that the SPVM has had with him? Why was Ian Davidson still at liberty in January 2012? Have other SPVM police helped Ian Davidson? In particular, the member for Chambly. 
"The basic rule, in such circumstances and in this troubling affair, it is to entrust this investigation to an independent investigator since members of the SPVM are directly involved. It is an essential gesture that the Minister of Public Security must ask the public to have confidence, "concluded Bertrand St-Arnaud.
