The blogger family living here, in Quebec, it is the duty of the minister to make everything implemented this ignoble violation of human rights, "said Carole Poirier. 
"In recent days, all political actors, including the governments of Quebec and Canada, continue to reaffirm the importance of freedom of expression and freedom of the press.
