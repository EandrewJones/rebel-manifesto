Quebec-the member for Drummond and the official opposition on the language opposition, Yves-François Blanchet, is concerned about the repeated refusal of the minister responsible for the application of the Charter of the French language, Christine St- Pierre, and the Quebec Office of the French language (OQLF) to apply the law on display. It provides vehemently the cost of another OQLF awareness campaign to companies to encourage them to take note of the law on the display and formulation of social reasons. 
"This campaign, at a cost of $ 500,000, is laughable. It's a lot of money to tell people that respect for the law, in Quebec, it's a choice. Businesses do not have much respect for the law 101 simply because the current government has also not. Rather than sanctioning, we will subsidize companies that will agree to francize their display. It is a flagrant lack of respect for our language, "denounced the spokesman for the Parti Québécois. 
According to MP Yves-François Blanchet, "There are Montreal neighborhoods and now suburbs where you practice unilingual English display in small businesses. It is not only the big chains that protect their trademarks and who do not see any reason to francize them. In shopping centers, the majority of businesses are in contravention of the law. What does the minister give as means to the OQLF? It authorizes the right to make checks to offenders who conform rather than imposing fines under the law, "he says.
