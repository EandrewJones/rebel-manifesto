Qu√©bec- The member for Bourget and spokesman for the Quebecois Party responsible for the French Language Charter, Maka Kotto, denounced the unacceptable declines by the Liberal government on display language. 
"For a year, we have tirelessly asks to the government to clog the legal breach that opened with the judgment of the Court of Appeal. For us, it goes through a modification of the Charter of the French language, as recommended by the judge. This amendment must stipulate that a generic or a description in French must accompany the display of a trademark in another language. It was the position of the government before judgment. However, last week, it decided to intervene by regulation, which is in itself a lower response than if it had chosen the legislative way, "said Maka Kotto. 
On the merits, the government project endorses the breach rather than filling it, since it offers an immense latitude of interpretation by authorizing "any other term or mention" rather than a generic or a description. "The government has clearly made the choice to go below what its position was before the judgment. This is a first unacceptable recoil. Then, by introducing the concept of "sufficient presence of French", the government opens a new breach and undermines the concept of predominance of French in the public display. It is a second unacceptable retreat, "to continue the member for Bourget. 
"The government must finally admit that beyond the language of display, French is under pressure in several respects in Quebec, and that it is urgent to show voluntarism. By rejecting our motion, which makes consensus among the opposition parties, the Liberal government of Philippe Couillard rejects our hand outstretched and, in the face of history, is the one who has made up our official language, " concluded Maka Kotto.
