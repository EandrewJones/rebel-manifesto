Quebec, March 1, 2017- In response to the dramatic fall of the number of wildlife protection officers under the Liberals, the member for Bonaventure and spokesman for the Quebecois, Fauna and Parks, Sylvain Party Roy, asks the Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, Luc Blanchet, to finally move on and increase the number of agents in the territory. 
Last spring, the Commissioner for Sustainable Development filed a devastating report on the management of wildlife in Quebec. His conclusions are overwhelming, including the decline in the number of wildlife officers, who compromises the protection of the fauna and security of citizens. "We went from 426 fauna officers in 2011 to 374 in 2016, of which 25% work part-time. It is an unacceptable decline in the workforce that endangers the sustainability of the entire sector, "said Sylvain Roy in a press point along with members of the Quebec Wildlife Protection Officers. 
No action in eight months 
"Eight months and two ministers later, nothing. No action to correct gaps. The government has abandoned the sector. The increase in poaching and intimidation behaviors in the forest to monopolize the territories, the deterioration of the quality of the experience for the succession, the inadequate protection of the wildlife habitat, the many abandoned files, all that tends to the Demonstrate, "also denounced the hon. Member. 
"Our request to the minister is clear: he must rehabilitate wildlife officers to give the Signal to Quebeckers that the State takes responsibility for the protection of one of the largest collective heritage in Quebec," concluded Sylvain Roy. 
Remember that there is nearly 712,000 fishermen who pass on average 13 days a year on the water bodies of Quebec, and that 285,000 hunters go on average 15 days a year in the forest. The economic benefits related to the wildlife sector are of the order of $ 1.6 billion.
