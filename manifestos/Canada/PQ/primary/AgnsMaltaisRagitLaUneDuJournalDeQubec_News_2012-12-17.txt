This morning, one of the newspaper of Quebec and the [Montreal Journal] (http: // Cematin, one of the newspaper of Quebec and the newspaper of Montreal make me pass for a fraudulender and I am totally outraged. Indeed In an exclusive article entitled "Unusual election expenses" means the fact of having reimbursed $ 88 to two volunteers for parking contraventions, $ 88 on total expenditures of $ 57,648. despite the fact that the fact that the Québécois de Taschereau Party has inscribed this expense in its relationship for transparency, journalistic treatment suggests that we have tried to make us refund. Nothing more wrong! We all knew that it could not be the case, at the point of Moral and legal view. Any expense made during an election must be declared and not register would have been worse for our eyes. Are the other political parties as transparent? 
The newspaper has chosen to focus its shooting on my political training. It is necessary to know the immense task of producing an electoral report to understand that an error can sometimes slip, especially when it is produced by activists during their free time, from information and many and complex data. If professionals make mistakes, can it that volunteers also comment on? Also, why did the Québec newspaper choose to put my picture to one to make a story with what is not, rather than correctly inform the readers? 
Why, except that the real goal of the newspaper is to attack my integrity directly, which I can not tolerate. There are limits to wanting politicians for thieves and feeding cynicism!
