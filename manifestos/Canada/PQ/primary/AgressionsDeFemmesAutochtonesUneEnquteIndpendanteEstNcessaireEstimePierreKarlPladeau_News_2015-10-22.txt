It is a very serious affair and it is necessary to show transparency. How is it that the government has not yet understood that the police investigating the police, it does not happen in the Quebec population? , "Added the leader of the Parti Québécois. 
It was last spring that the Minister of Public Safety, Lise Thériault, was aware that serious sex crimes were committed against aboriginal women, on many occasions. "Faced with this situation, what did the Deputy Prime Minister do? She decided to treat her as if it were a banal affair. What a lack of judgment! Pierre Karl Péladeau pursued.
