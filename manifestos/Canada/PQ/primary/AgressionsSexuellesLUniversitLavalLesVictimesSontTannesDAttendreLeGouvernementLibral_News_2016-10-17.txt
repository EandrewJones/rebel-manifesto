Quebec- The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in the field of women's status, Mireille Jean, as well as the spokesman for education, research and educational perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, are dismayed by the series of sexual assaults that occurred Last weekend on Laval University campus. Their thoughts go to the victims of these acts; They want them to get all the support needed to get through this ordeal. 
"After the events related to the initiation activities occurring at the beginning of September, we had last Friday, another proof that the situation is untenable on university campuses. Rather than making media outings whenever there is a fire, the minister responsible for higher education, Hélène David, should convince his government that we must act at the source of the problem. It must first establish Quebec standards in the fight against sexual violence, then require post-secondary education institutions to adopt internal policies that meet these standards; It's a question of coherence, "said Alexandre Cloutier. 
"The government strategy to prevent and counter sexual violence has been expected for more than three years. What does the Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Lise Thériault? Since 2013, since there is no action plan, there has been no sufficient investment in this area. The consequences are important: there are fewer and fewer prevention actions and, above all, lists and waiting time for the treatment of victim complaints are lying dramatically. This is unacceptable! I ask Minister Thériault to submit as soon as possible the new government strategy. I also call for the budgets that will be consequential. I would also add that the lean $ 2 million over 5 years in the last budget is clearly insufficient, compared to the $ 60 million in the 2008-2013 action plan to the fight against sexual violence, "concluded Mireille. Jeans.
