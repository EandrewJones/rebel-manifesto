Quebec- The member of Pointe-Aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for primary and secondary education and school perseverance, Nicole LÃ©ger, asks the Minister of Education, Leisure and Sport, Yves Bolduc, stop playing the ostrich and admit that the massive cuts decided by the Liberal government directly affect the most vulnerable students. 
Today, we learn in a press article that schools are preparing to slash food aid and the "act otherwise" program, designed to promote academic success. "These are programs that are in place to directly help students from modest environment. The liberal cuts are precisely affecting students who need it most! "Said the member of the Quebecois Party. 
"For several weeks, Minister Yves Bolduc has refused to recognize that he is the only cutting officer made in Quebec schools. This little game must stop. It was its firm that handed over to school boards a list comprising 32 suggestions for possible cuts in student services, including the "Act otherwise" program. It was the minister who cut the money, it was the minister who suggested where to do it is the minister who sabs the help of the most vulnerable; It is undeniably bolduc cuts, "continued lightweight Nicole. 
The hon. Member recalls that these cups touching the least favored students arise while Minister Yves Bolduc still refuses to completely repay his doctor premium of $ 215,000. "It once again demonstrates that it should no longer be minister. He must reimburse his premium and resign, "concluded the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles.
