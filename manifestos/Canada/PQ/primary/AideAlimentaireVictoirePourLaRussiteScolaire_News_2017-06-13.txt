"Academic success begins with the assurance that students who come to class have full belly. This liberal government was completely foolish and had no choice but to cancel it. However, we will ensure that the new money announced by the minister are sufficient to meet the needs in all regions of Quebec. It is at the real impact on the ground that we will pay particular attention, "said Alexandre Cloutier. 
"We had to put the double bites to make the government sound. I would like to thank my colleagues from the Quebecois Partiaudière Party, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Gaspésie and Bas-Saint-Laurent, who have started at work together to convince the government not to cut in food aid. It's a great victory for Quebec students and for their success, and we are extremely proud to have led this battle for them, "the member concluded.
