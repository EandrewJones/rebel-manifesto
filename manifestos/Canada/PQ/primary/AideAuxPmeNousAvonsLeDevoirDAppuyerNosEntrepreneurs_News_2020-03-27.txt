Quebec, March 27, 2020 - The member for René-Lévesque, Parliamentary Leader of the Québécois Party and Spokesperson in Economics, Martin Ouellet, asks the Government to do more to support SMEs, including those in the sectors services and goods. "These are these entrepreneurs who boost the economy of our regions; We have the duty to support them as much as possible, and as quickly as possible, "he said. 
IN SHORT 
The member for René-Lévesque admits the entry of play: François Legault's government has made essential decisions to respond to the health crisis we face. However, the effort requested from small traders at a particularly high price: in addition to having had to close their doors, they are hit hard by the iniquity that creates the inclusion of large stores in the list of shops Essentials. For many specialized shops, the situation is perilous. 
"We can not let that, esteem Martin Ouellet. The survival of several small businesses depends on it. We must be sensitive to their situation. I spoke to the Minister of the Economy, Pierre Fitzgibbon, and asked him to pay liquidity to the affected business people as soon as possible. I also claimed the suspension of payments to Hydro Québec, and the postponement of tax refunds collected in February and March. In my view, these first steps could tip the scales for many entrepreneurs. » 
"SMEs, especially those in the region, participate in the creation of our collective wealth. When we have surmounted this health crisis, we will need them to go up the slope, to revitalize our economy, to keep our attractive environments. That's why we work tirelessly to prepare, from now on, the upcoming recovery ", has also insisted Martin Ouellet. 
Always ready to collaborate with the government, members of the Caucus of the Parti Québécois are deeply committed to finding the most effective and fastest ways to support Quebec SMEs, and to help put them into practice.
