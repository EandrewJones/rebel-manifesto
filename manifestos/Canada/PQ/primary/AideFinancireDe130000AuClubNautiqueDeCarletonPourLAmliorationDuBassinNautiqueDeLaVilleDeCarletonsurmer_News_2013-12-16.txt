Carleton-sur-Mer- The hon. Member for Bonaventure and Parliament Assistant to the Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks (Fauna and Parks), Mr. Sylvain Roy, on behalf of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and occupation of the territory and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announces the award of $ 130,000 financial assistance to Carleton Nautical Club for the first phase of its basin improvement project Nautical of the city of Carleton-sur-Mer. 
This project is needed because the current configuration of Carleton-sur-Mer's marina, which hosts about fifty boats, is at the origin of a significant security problem. In times of dominant winds, the location of the pier lets in the swell, which causes some agitation inside the basin. By the installation of breezes, the basin improvement project will therefore reduce the strength of the swell, to contain the agitation inside the basin and to better protect the boats that are moored there. 
"It is with great pride that I announce this financial assistance from the Government of Quebec that will ensure the safety of boaters, while contributing to the development of a regional maritime center in the bay of Chaleurs. I am convinced that this tourist-structuring project will showcase the natural resources of Carleton-sur-Mer, maintain the exceptional quality of life of people from here and attracting many visitors to one of the most beautiful berries at Quebec, "said MP Sylvain Roy. 
Financial assistance comes from the cyclical fund of developmentDuministre of municipal affairs, regions and occupation of the territory.
