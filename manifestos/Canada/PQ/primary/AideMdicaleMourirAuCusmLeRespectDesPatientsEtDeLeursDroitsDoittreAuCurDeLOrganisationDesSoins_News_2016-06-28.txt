Quebec- The member for Joliette and spokesman for the Parti Québécois in terms of end-of-life care and justice, Véronique Hivon, denounces the MUHC decision, who refuses to offer medical assistance to dying to patients who are hospitalized at his palliative care unit. 
"We were shocked to learn that the management of the MUHC forces the movement of end-of-life patients, under the pretext that doctors in the palliative care unit refuse to provide them with medical assistance to die. It is not for patients to adapt to the organization of care; It is the responsibility of the establishment to provide care to patients, with respect for their autonomy, their decision-making freedom and their dignity. It is inconceivable that patients, because they are in a hospital or unit X, need to fight to access the care they are entitled, "said Véronique Hivon. 
"Require patients who have been treated to the MUHC for at least 18 months to receive medical assistance to die is a totally absurd criterion and the law. The Minister must recall the MUHC at the right-hand law, ensure that all institutions respect the rights of end-of-life patients, and remind them of the provisions of the law. The MUHC situation should not create a brake for end-of-life patients, discourage them from asking for the care they are entitled, "said the spokesperson. 
"The minister must guarantee all patients, no matter where they are treated, access to the continuum of end-of-life care, including medical assistance to die. It is absolutely inhuman to move patients at the end of life because of the resistance of certain environments and an ideological opposition; Patients and their rights must be at the heart of all the concerns of health care teams, managers and the organization of care, "said Véronique Hivon.
