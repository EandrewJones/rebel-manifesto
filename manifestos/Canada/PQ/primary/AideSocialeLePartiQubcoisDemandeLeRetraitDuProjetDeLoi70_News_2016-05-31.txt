Quebec- The member for Saint-Jean and spokesman for the Parti Québécois in terms of employment, social solidarity, fight against poverty, vocational training, adult education, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte , asked the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, François Blais, to withdraw Bill 70, supporting, like many experts, that punitive measures are ineffective and retrograde. 
"Since the filing of Bill 70, which requires new social assistance applicants to join the Employment Objective program, under penalty of sanctions, criticisms fuse on all sides. Imagine: a provider can see its amputated check of $ 224 a month, out of a total of $ 624. But who can live with only $ 400 a month? ", Asked the member for Saint John. 
Let us mention in passing that even the employers have doubts about the punitive measures imposed by this bill. In addition, 300 former colleagues from the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, academics, requested his withdrawal. 
The spokesperson also indicates that after more than 65 hours of parliamentary commission and many questions in the House, it is still impossible to know the results of the studies that were carried out on Bill 70 as to the impacts it Could have on new social assistance applicants. "Certainly, the punitive part of the bill must be withdrawn because it will certainly cause serious consequences for them," he added. 
"Several solutions have been proposed in parliamentary committee. The situation should not be limited to a simple job aid program; As a company, instead of penalizing new social assistance applicants, we need to invest more in the fight against school dropout, in francization and literacy. And, if the government really wants to lower the number of new applicants, it must present a bill incentive, and non-punitive, "concluded Dave Turcotte.
