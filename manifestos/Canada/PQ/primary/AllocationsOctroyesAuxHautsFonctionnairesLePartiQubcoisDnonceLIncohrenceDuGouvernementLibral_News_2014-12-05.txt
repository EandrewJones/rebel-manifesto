Quebec- The member for Sanguinet and official opposition spokesperson for the Treasury Board and Pension Plans, Alain Therrien, denounces the inconsistency of the President of the Treasury Board, Martin Coiteous, about the generous allowances For the transport given to senior officials and the leaders of the Crown corporations. 
Asked this morning in the National Assembly by the journalists, the President of the Treasury Board mentioned that the allowances were part of the overall compensation and that the Government "N '[was] not in mode to review the contracts that exist". 
"Yet, in the record of Bill 3 on the pension plans for municipal employees and retirees, the government did not hesitate to break down contracts and collective agreements duly signed. This inconsistency is flagrant; The middle class, families and retirees are tackled, but we do not want to break the contracts signed with senior officials or rulers of Crown corporations. The government does not know where it goes, except when it comes to its austerity policy, which directly affects families and regions of Quebec, "said Alain Therien.
