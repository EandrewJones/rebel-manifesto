Quebec- The member for Sanguinet and the official opposition on the work and pension plans, Alain Therrien, responded to the amendments made by the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Pierre Moreau, to Bill 3 , An Act to promote financial health and sustainability of defined benefit pension plans in the municipal sector. 
"Unfortunately, it is found that even with the amendments presented, Bill 3 remains a unique solution to a problem that, to be settled, would ask for more flexibility. Several proposed changes are only temporal and accessories. Workers and municipalities would, among other things, have any additional leverage to negotiate; It's a great opportunity missed, "said Alain Therrien. 
In addition, the minister seems to realize that his bill was going too far. "The Minister proposes the postponement of the automatic deindexation of retirees' annuities, as well as not to open, before their maturity, the contracts in force when the pension plans are fully capitalized. In doing so, he implicitly admits that there is no urgency to modify the contracts of healthy financial regimes. Obviously, Pierre Moreau tries to get out of a quagmire in which he himself implicated, "continued the spokesman. 
Clearly, it has become necessary to ensure the sustainability of the pension plans for municipal employees; That's why, earlier this week, the Parti Québécois has supported the principle of the bill. However, he also requested that the actuarial assessments of the pension plan on December 31, 2013 be, which the government still refuses to do. However, if we want to seriously study this bill and arrive at the best possible solution, get the real portrait of the situation is absolutely essential. "Given the accounts proposed by the minister, we explain wrongly why he refused to wait a dozen days, the time required to obtain the data, in order to allow the parliamentarians to adequately work, in the light of the The most recent figures, "concluded Alain Therrien.
