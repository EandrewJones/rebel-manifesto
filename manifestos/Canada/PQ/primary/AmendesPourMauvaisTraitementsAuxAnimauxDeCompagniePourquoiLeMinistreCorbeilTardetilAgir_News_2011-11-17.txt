Quebec - "It took the opposition to intervene and put pressure for the government to announce the possible submission of a bill to increase fines for puppy plant operators. It's Singer for the population who expected the government to act as soon as the report of the Pets Working Group more than two years ago, "said the hon. Member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata and door -Position of the official opposition in agriculture and food, André Simard, following a question asked by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Corbeil. 
"The report expressly proposed to increase the fines that are currently far from deterrent. When an owner receives a fine of $ 600 while he can sell his dogs hundreds of dollars each, it is necessary to question the penalty imposed. In addition, the proposed pet security and well-being announced last June did not succeed, "added André Simard. 
"The Liberal government is slow to tackle the problems of puppy plants and to give the trick needed to redress the situation in Quebec. As the population is claimed, we do not want, to the Parti Québécois, see other cases of puppy factories in Quebec. These unacceptable situations must stop. Minister Corbeil must take responsibility and act without delay, "concluded the hon. Member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata.
