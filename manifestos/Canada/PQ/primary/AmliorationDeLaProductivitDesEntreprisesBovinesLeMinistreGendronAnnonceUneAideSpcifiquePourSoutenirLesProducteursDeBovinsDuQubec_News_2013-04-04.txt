Québec- Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, François Gendron, announces specific help to improve the productivity of bovine businesses. This aid aims to support styling calf breeding companies whose gross farm incomes are less than $ 100,000. These companies account for nearly 68% of Quebec's bovine farms. 
"Since I carried out the minister's position, cattle producers have challenged me and told me about the particular problems they face in recent years. Thanks to this specific help, coupled with support and advice as well as initiatives recommended by agricultural advisers, cattle producers will make their businesses more efficient and competitive. The trend must be reversed to stimulate bovine production in the different regions of Quebec, "said Francois Gendron. 
Specifically, this assistance provides, as a first step, personalized support by an agricultural advisor who will prepare an action plan following a simplified diagnosis determining the strengths and weaknesses of the company. In a second step, the company may benefit from financial assistance to carry out the interventions recommended in the action plan that concerns it. Financial assistance can reach 50% of eligible expenses up to $ 10,000. 
"This help is needed and will meet the special needs of the cattle sector. Companies in this sector play an important role in the occupation of the territory and this is one of the reasons that lead us to make every effort to ensure their growth and sustainability, "concluded the minister.
