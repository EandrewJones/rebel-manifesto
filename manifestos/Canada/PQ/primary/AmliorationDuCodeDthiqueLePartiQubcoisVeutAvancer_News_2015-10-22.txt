Quebec- The parliamentary leader of the official opposition, Bernard Drainville, invites other political courses to advance the work of the Commission on the implementation of the code of ethics and ethics of the members of the National Assembly. 
The Parti Québécois wants the improvement of the code of ethics and ethics of deputies progresses. "We have already proposed, at the end of the works, last June, to work quickly on the articles that did not have a major problem. We are open and ready to collaborate, "said Bernard Drainville. 
In order to rely on the work, the official opposition will now submit to the Committee on Institutions a list of people to help to help parliamentarians in their work. "These are the same stakeholders who had been heard when creating the Code. If their recommendations were relevant when we created the code of ethics, they are certainly still, now that we modernize it. We hope that the other parties will acquiesate at our request, "Drainville continued. 
"If the Liberal Party and the CAQ want a real improvement of the Code, and that we succeed, in the near future, to a constructive bill, they will have the full collaboration of the Québécois party," he concluded.
