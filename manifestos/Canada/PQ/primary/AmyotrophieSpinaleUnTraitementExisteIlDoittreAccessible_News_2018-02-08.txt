A treatment exists; It must be accessible 
Quebec, February 8, 2018 - In the framework of the deposit of a petition with more than 15,000 signatures, the member for Saint John and the official opposition to the social services, the protection of youth and For records related to the drug industry, Dave Turcotte, held a press briefing when he claimed that the Spinraza drug, recognized as an effective treatment for stopping the progression of spinal amyotrophy, be financed by the RAMQ. 
IN SHORT 
Accompanied by children with spinal amyotrophy and their parents, the member recalled the benefits of Spinraza's drug. "The clinical evidence abound: Spinraza improves the motor and respiratory capacities of people affected and reduces the progression of the disease. It thus improves the quality of life of the sick and reduces the load resting on the shoulders of their loved ones. The pressure on the health network would also be diminished, "he argues. 
Dave Turcotte insists: Finance Spinraza is a matter of justice. "No reason comes to justify that patients with spinal amyotrophy are discriminated; Other treatments related to rare diseases are funded on the basis of knowledge, clinical trials and results similar to those relating to Spinraza, "he added. 
However, underlines the spokesperson for now, the company producing Spinraza sells it a lot too expensive. "The Minister of Health, Ga√©tan Barrette, must put pressure on the company so that it decreases its prices. Thus, the impact on public finances, already very low, would be almost zero. But the most important thing remains that it intervenes quickly. Because plus the treatment is administered early, the more the motor and respiratory capacities of the patients are preserved. We do not have the right to deprive Quebecers with spinal amyotrophy of the hope of a better life, "he concluded.
