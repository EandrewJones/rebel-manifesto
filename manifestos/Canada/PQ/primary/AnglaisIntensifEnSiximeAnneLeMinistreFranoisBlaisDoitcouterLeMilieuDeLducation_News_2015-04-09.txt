Quebec- The member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and sentence of the official opposition in terms of primary and secondary education, Nicole Léger, joins his voice to that of various stakeholders in the world of education and asserts that the Implementation of the intensive English program in sixth grade should not be unilaterally; Rather, we need to listen to schoolswoman and collaborate with them. 
"Four years have passed, and it is now obvious that the great Liberal dream of English mandatory for all in sixth year does not hold the road. Is it? What intensive learning of English is a good idea for a young person who already has learning difficulties in the fifth year? The answer is no. Is it a good idea for allophone children living in an environment where the English language is omnipresent? No. And it's the same for Francophone schools whose students live in an English-speaking environment; Let's think west of Montreal. This is particularly for these reasons that compulsory English for all in sixth year is not viable, "Nicole Léger said. 
"On all sides, we denounce the quality of the French young people, especially in CEGEPs and universities. Available resources should first target an improvement in teaching our own language, especially in a context where duties, francization and services for learning difficulties undergo compressions, and when The government wants to increase the number of students per class. Intensive English must be implemented correctly, respecting the resources available and supporting teachers and education professionals, "concluded Nicole Léger.
