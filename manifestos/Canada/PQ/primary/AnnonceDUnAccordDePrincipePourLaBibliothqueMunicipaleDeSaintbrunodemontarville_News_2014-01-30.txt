"Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville has long distributed as a city with an extraordinary dynamism and the agreement today testifies once again. There is no doubt that libraries remain a reference place for cultural vitality. In the exercise of my duties, I am able to see how much culture contributes to the quality of life of our cities, in addition to strengthening the social fabric, "said Maka Kotto. 
The agreement in principle will allow the city to complete the studies and to cross the various stages to lead to a complete definition of the library renovation project.

The project will proceed to the redevelopment and the purchase of specialized furniture and equipment. The library is located in the heart of the municipality, and its proximity to the city center promotes its accessibility for residents. It serves a population of about 26,600 inhabitants. 
The agreement in principle is made possible through the Department of Culture and Communications Capital Assistance Program. The city of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville is a partner of this project and contributes by paying $ 1,088,710, the other half of the total amount estimated at $ 2,177,420.
