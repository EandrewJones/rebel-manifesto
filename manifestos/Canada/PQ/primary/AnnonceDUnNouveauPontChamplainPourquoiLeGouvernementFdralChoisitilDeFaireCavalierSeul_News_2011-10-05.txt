Qu√©bec-The member for Gouin and the official opposition spokesman, Nicolas Girard, deplores that the federal government has chosen to make rider alone in the construction project of a new Champlain bridge. "The absence of the Government of Quebec is worrying for the rest of things since such a project requires a consultation of all stakeholders in the metropolis and will lead to significant costs for Quebeckers," said the member. 
"For five years, the studies have demonstrated the urgency of building a new bridge to ensure the safety of all users and the fluidity of the transport of goods, mentioned Nicolas Girard, recalling the vital link for the economy of Quebec that constitutes the Champlain Bridge. Why did you wait so long? ", Is he wondering. 
"There is neither schedule nor precise financing and above all there is no reference to the collective transport that must be an integral part of a new bridge. All stakeholders in the metropolis as well as the Quebec government believe that a lightweight rail (SLR) system should be part of the project. By working alone, the federal government ignores the will and needs of the population of the great metropolitan area, "added the spokesman. 
In addition, with regard to the idea that a toll is instituted, the member for Gouin stated that "as long as the public transport offer will not be larger, more efficient and faster, it will be premature. 'impose on motorists such a toll ". 
"The choice of the federal government to work in silo is worrying for the future. Already, motorists have undergone the inconvenience of the lack of planning and consultation between Quebec and Ottawa, history should not be repeated while the work of the Turkot exchanger will begin next year and those of the new bridge in In the following years, "concluded Nicolas Girard, making a commitment to continue to put the need for today's announcement to realize and as quickly as possible.
