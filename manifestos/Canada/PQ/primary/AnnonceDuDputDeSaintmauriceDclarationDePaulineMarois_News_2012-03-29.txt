Québec- Following the decision taken by MP Claude Pinard not to be represented at the next election campaign, the Leader of the Official Opposition, Pauline Marois, wanted to pay tribute today. Here is the message she sent her. 
"Quebec, March 29, 2012 
Mr. Claude Pinard  Member of Saint-Maurice  695 Station Avenue  Shawinigan (Quebec) G9N 1V9 
Dear Colleague, 
After more than 16 years at the service of the citizens of the riding of Saint-Maurice and Quebec, you have made the choice not to represent you at the next general election. Knowing the attachment and love that you do to the citizens of Saint-Maurice and the Mauricie in general, I have no doubt that this decision has not been easy to take. I am convinced that it is regretted that they will welcome it. 
Throughout your political career, you have shown great determination in all the causes and files you defended. You have always done it with a lot of abnegation and a franc speak and you have never hesitated to defend your constituency and the Mauricie. 
With you, Claude, we always had the right time. You knew how to deliver the bottom of your thought, and it always keeps the greatest respect for your colleagues and for our institutions. Your Frank Camaraderie will have made you a popular member of all members of the National Assembly. 
Finally, I can not ignore your involvement for the cause of Quebec that is at the origin of your passage in politics. Your unshakable convictions have made you a spokesperson for the most effective for promoting the independence of Quebec. 
I am convinced that the Parti Québécois and the sovereignist movement will always be able to count on you when it comes time to fight for Quebec and for Mauricie. You can be proud of what you have accomplished. 
I thank you for your great loyalty in Quebec! 
Pauline Marois »
