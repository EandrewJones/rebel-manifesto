Québec- The member for Duplessis, Lorraine Richard, is pleased with the implementation of the Metal Silicon Factory Project, a project of the multinational ferroatlántica, in Port Cartier. It recalls that this implantation has been made possible thanks to the interventions of the government of the Parti Québécois. 
Indeed, during the participation in the World Economic Forum of Davos, in 2013, the Premier Pauline Marois had met with the President of Ferroatlántica to discuss the possibility of this implantation. In January 2014, the government of the Parti Québécoisfacked the announcement of what is happening today. 
"This structuring project for the economy of our region and all Quebec stands for 345 quality jobs, in addition to all indirect jobs that will be created. The city of Port Cartier and the Côte-Nord region represent an interesting business environment, in addition to being strategically located for the transport and logistics of a factory of this scale, "said Lorraine Richard. 
The FerroatLántica project represents investments of $ 382 million and production, ultimately 100,000 tonnes of silicon per year. 
Lorraine Richard had ardently defended the strategic position of Port Cartier during a meeting between the people of Ferroatlántica and the decision-makers of the city last March. "During these exchanges, I could see the dynamism and solid organization of the people of the community. They succeeded and I congratulate them for all the work accomplished, "concluded the hon. Member.
