Quebec- The member for Sanguinet and spokesman of the Parti Québécois in terms of energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, and the member for Duplessis and Nordic Development Spokesperson, Lorraine Richard, reacted today The announcement of the resignation of Alexander Gagnon as spokesperson for anticostic hydrocarbons. MPs call on the government to stop hindering the exploration work on the island of Anticosti by using false pretexts, such as failure to comply with administrative deadlines or improvised implementation of a new committee. 
"The anticosti file should not be submitted to the political maneuvers of Philippe Couillard. The Government must respond to the publication of the EES report, the strategic environmental assessment, specific to Anticosti. He must also cease his systematic obstruction now and allow the contract to be respected, "said Alain Therien. 
"The resignation, today, spokesperson Alexandre Gagnon sends the message that private companies who sign partnerships or contracts with the Government of Quebec can not trust Philippe Couillard, nor in its ministers. It is disturbing, when we know that the Quebec economy has been in poor post from the arrival of the liberals in power, in 2014, "continued Lorraine Richard. 
Recall that on May 9, the government announced in Petrolia, its business partner, a new "expert committee", of which it had never been discussed before, would be created to delay the analysis of the application for authorization of exploratory work. This illustrates how urgent it is that the Liberal government deposits the Hydrocarbon Bill that has been promising for months to end the dual speech by Philippe Couillard and to release companies from uncertainty.
