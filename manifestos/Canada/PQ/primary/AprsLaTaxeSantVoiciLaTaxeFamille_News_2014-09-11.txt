Quebec- The Member of Parliament for Terrebonne and Family Opposition Spokesman, Mathieu Traversy, denounces the attack on the Liberal government by putting an end to the universality of educational child care rates , to modulate them by the addition of a tax calculated according to the income of the parents. 
"After the liberal health tax, here is the family tax! At the last election campaign, the Liberal Party hammered that there would be no tariff shock for families; But now he attacks them directly by a new tax. The government does not respect its word. At the first opportunity, because of his inability to stimulate Quebec's economy and job creation, Philippe Couillard resumes the good old liberal recipe: charge more taxes to families, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
The middle class will pay more 
We will not properly; This measure will not affect that the very high employees, it will focus on the families of the middle class. "These families, who already assume a large tax burden, will have to pay even more for a service they already finance equitably through their taxes. In addition, in the same CPE, how to justify that some parents pay more than others for the same service? ", he added. 
The hon. Member recalls that equality of opportunity and accessibility for all are the basis of the implementation of CEPs. Quality care services make it possible to better reconcile family life and work. In addition, a mother or a single-parent father can thus access the labor market more easily. The resulting economic intake is important, as well as quality jobs created in all regions of Quebec. 
"Once again, the Liberals confuse an investment for the whole society and an expense. The universality of custody rates ensures equal opportunities. For ideological motifs, the Liberals throw in the trash a critical pan of the social net of Quebec, "concluded Mathieu Traversy.
