Quebec, on September 13, 2016 -The Member of Parliament for Matane-Matapédia and spokesperson for Public Safety, Pascal Bérubé, is surprised to see the Minister of Public Safety, Martin Coiteous, delegate to his parliamentary assistant, The hon. Member for Vimont, Jean Rousselle, a tour of detention facilities. 
"Not only Martin Cloueux does not bother to visit the detention institutions but, in addition, we repeat last February scenario, while the Minister of Transport had caused the general surprise by sending the member for Mégantic Inspect the Matane-Baie-Comeau-Godbout ferry. After Ghislain Bolduc who checks the bolts of a ship, we are entitled to Jean Rousselle who examines prisons. It's not serious, "said Pascal Bérubé. 
The problems facing detention facilities are serious: overpopulation, lack of staff, maintenance deficit, flights from drones, riots, etc. "Last July, I proposed to the government a realistic track of solution by requesting a traveling parliamentary commission. Thus, members of all political courses could hear the testimony of people directly concerned by these issues. The Minister of Public Safety refuses this proposal, preferring to send his parliamentary assistant to visit the institutions, but without involving anyone else in the process. We are not fools; The Liberals must admit that they act as well to save time, not to solve the problems, "concluded the member.
