Quebec- Following the announcement of a production stop and the launch of the Tio Mine workers of Rio Tinto, Iron and Titanium, in Havre-Saint-Pierre, the member for Duplessis and Door -Parole of the Parti Québécois in Nordic Development, Lorraine Richard, denounces the inaction of the Liberal government, which does nothing to help the communities concerned. 
Nearly 350 workers will be affected by the suspension of activities at Tio Mine, scheduled as early as mid-October and March 2016; In addition, a hundred positions will be definitively abolished. This is another hard hit for the North Shore region, already severely affected by the slowdown in mining activities. 
"The government has to quickly find solutions to help workers, businesses and communities who actually live the consequences of this production stop. With the North Plan, the Liberal government of Jean Charest has appropriated the merit of a favorable conjuncture. Now that the economy is unfavorable, we can see that the North Plan of Philippe Couillard is empty and that communities are left to themselves. The only economic policy of the Liberal government is a plan that only to lather its image when the metal market is fine, "said Lorraine Richard. 
In Minganie, the direct and indirect jobs related to Rio Tinto represent a great deal of the economy, and several companies depend exclusively on Tio mine activities. "The Liberal government speaks only austerity. When is a real revival of the economy? What does it mean to support diversification and develop the economy of the regions? Will the projects of the North plan provide a job for 350 workers from Havre-Saint-Pierre? I do not believe it, "concluded Lorraine Richard.
