Quebec, on March 20, 2017- The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in education, research, school perseverance and literacy, Alexandre Cloutier, denounces the gap of $ 627 million between the sums announced and what is really Invested in the Education Network for the year 2016-2017. Deadlines that lengthen to obtain ministerial authorization, are promised that never arrive, so directed envelopes that they can not be spent ... all this creates accounting artifices and explains the immense gap. 
"The Liberals present us version 2.0 of austerity, more subtle, more sneaky, but still so bad. The government claims that it invests, but in reality it does not spend the sums promised. All this coffering, while the needs explode in the network, that the number of students in difficulty increases and that several schools fall into ruin, "lamented Alexandre Cloutier. 
"By digging a little, we notice that the department's deadlines have disastrous consequences for student services. At the college, the budgetary terms concerning the reception and integration of Aboriginal people, students with disabilities and francization arrived with more than 6 months late; In some places, they are always waiting. In some cases, money arrives so late that directions no longer have the opportunity to engage resources. As a result, the money is not spent and the money continues to sleep at the department, "said the member. 
"As if it were not enough, the Liberals took advantage of the latest economic update to announce additional $ 35 million for the current school year. However, as of today, the education network is still waiting for details. Let us remember last year; The scenario was exactly the same. The Liberals then announced $ 20 million when updating and finally the sums came to swell the surpluses rather than to be invested in the services, "concluded the spokesperson.
