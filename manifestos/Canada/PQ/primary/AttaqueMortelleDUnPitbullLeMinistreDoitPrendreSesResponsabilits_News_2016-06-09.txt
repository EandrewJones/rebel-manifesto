Quebec- The hon. Member for René-Lévesque and spokesman for the Parti Québécois on municipal affairs, Martin Ouellet, is troubled by the statements by the Minister of Public Safety and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Martin Coiteous, as to which wear Responsibility for the solutions to be put in place to prevent a event from repeating such as the one who has produced yesterday in the river-des-Prairies-Pointe-aux-Trembles district, during which a 55-year-old woman lost their lives After having probably been attacked by a pitbull. "The autonomy of cities is not the real debate, currently," he said from the entry of play. 
"Today, I ask the Coiteous Minister to show leadership and pragmatism for this situation to be treated at the national level. He was open to watching new avenues, and I think we need to look at it together so that the population feels safely in every neighborhood, city and village of Quebec. Ontario has already legislated to ban the pitbulls and I think we can - even do it to Quebec. The security of Quebecers is also exposed to the member for René-Lévesque. 
"The drama of yesterday has left a strong perception in public opinion as to the real danger of this type of animal in the communities. Today, the government can not scroll and return the ball in the municipal camp. The death of this lady is a dead man. The minister has the duty to reassure the population; To do this, he must first stop disappowering and acting before there are other victims, "concluded Martin Ouellet.
