Quebec - Member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, the hon. Member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesperson for international relations, Carole Poirier, as well as the member for Joliette and spokesperson Culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, express, on behalf of all the elected officials of the Parti Québécois, all their solidarity with the French people and the journalistic community against the terrible attack perpetrated early this morning at the headquarters of the newspaper Charlie Hebdo. 
"Our thoughts go to the families of the victims, to whom we offer our most sincere condolences, but also, more widely, to the representatives of the press. This area is one of the pillars of our democracy, an attack on journalists always has a particular resonance. We denounce this attack and remain in solidarity with the French and all those who fight for freedom of the press, a value we share it, "said the official opposition. 
"The French Republic has always placed the freedom of the press at the heart of its fundamental values, even if it has experienced acts of violence that aimed it. Each time she has been able to get up, unite and defend themselves with these attacks, "honored the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Carole Poirier. 
"The attack that has been perpetrated this morning aimed at representatives of a newspaper who has always had the courage to use the absurd to denounce events or situations. Charlie Hebdo had dared to publish caricatures and texts that invited his readers to defend freedom of conscience. We want to express our solidarity to all the press representatives, who are fighting every day to defend the fundamental right of populations to access information, "said the member for Joliette, Véronique Hivon.
