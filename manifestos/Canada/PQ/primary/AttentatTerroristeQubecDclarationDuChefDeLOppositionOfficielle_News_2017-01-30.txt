Quebec, on January 30, 2017 - The Head of the Official Opposition, Jean-François Lisé, made the following statement in response to the terrorist attack perpetrated at the Islamic Cultural Center of Quebec. 
"We were all struck by the horror, affected by the sentence who fell on the people of Quebec and the Muslim community. Quebeckers, family fathers have been mowed loosely, leaving a large number of people, women and children, mourning. I offer all my condolences to relatives and families of the victims. 
These people were slaughtered for a reason: they exercised a fundamental right, to meet in a place of worship. We are all affected in our freedom. 
In one of the most peaceful cities in the world, this terrorist act is revolting. On behalf of the Parti Québécois, I invite all Quebeckers to demonstrate their solidarity with our fellow citizens of Muslim confession. As my colleague Agnès Maltais so well said, one of the great qualities of life in Quebec and Quebec City is the refusal of violence. The people of my country, all the people of my country, are people of words and not violence. 
We must affirm it, all united, in the hours and days coming. If you meet a Muslim Quebecer, greet him. Give him your condolences. »
