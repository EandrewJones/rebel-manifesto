Quebec, February 21, 2020 - The member for René-Lévesque, Parliamentary Leader of the Parti Québécois and Finance Spokesperson, Martin Ouellet, presented this morning the expectations of his political training for the purpose of the budget by the government , on March 10th. 
IN SHORT 
First, a nationalist government must absolutely insist with the federal government to obtain not only its listening, but also its due. "Ottawa has been ignoring Quebec for too long. Tax points should be repatriated here in Quebec City, as well as all budgets concerning culture. And it's a minimum. I invite the Government of François Legault to be firmly facing the federal government; If he needs support, he can count on us, "said the spokesperson. 
"Quebeckers expect their government, through its budget, corrects some injustices. The CAQ must therefore seize the opportunity and ensure that Quebec concretely improves its balance sheet in terms of social justice. Vulnerable, poor or sick people, seniors, children and women victims of violence, among others, are entitled to better protection, equity guarantees, "added the member. 
Finally, the Parti Québécois asks the government to give depth to its environmental claims, which are currently a rather pale green. "We are no longer in the era of follow-up commitments; We have a duty to future generations. The adoption of a "carbon budget" would force the government, whatever it may be, to honor its promises and achieve its objectives. In this regard, a good start would be to allocate the sums necessary for the application of the 32 recommendations contained in the CAPERN report on the impacts of the use of pesticides on public health and the environment, "concluded. Martin Ouellet.
