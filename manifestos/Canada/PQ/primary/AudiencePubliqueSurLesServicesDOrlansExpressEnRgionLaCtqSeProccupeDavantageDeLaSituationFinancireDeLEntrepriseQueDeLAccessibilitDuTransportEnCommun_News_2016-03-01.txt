Quebec - On February 12, we learned that a hearing from the Quebec Transport Commission (CTQ) regarding the decrease in Orleans Express services in the region would be held in Quebec on March 14. Gaétan Lelièvre, spokesman for the Quebec's regional development, and Martine Ouellet, spokesperson for transport, distorts this decision, that they perceive as a lack of obvious respect for citizens living in the regions and using the regions the bus services referred to. 
Gaétan Lelièvre also regrets that the CTQ's mandate focuses solely on the financial impacts that the Orléans Express services will have, to the detriment of its negative impact on the clientele and development of the regions. "This adds to a long list of examples demonstrating the lack of government consideration for regions," he said. 
"This is a major file for the mobility of people and the maintenance of collective transport services in the region. People are mobilized and take the stake to heart. I may quote the case of the volunteer rescue committee pierced transport that for a year tries to be heard by the Ministry of Transport and the CTQ. However, this one now asks him to make 1500 km to attend a hearing directly ", has denounced Martine Ouellet. 
The decrease in services in the Region has been authorized in October 2014 by the CTQ and has been applied since January 2015. In addition to this reduction, some trips have literally been abandoned. For example, the Victoriaville-Thetford Mines, Grande-Rivière-Gaspé and Trois-Rivières-La Tuque are no longer offered by Orleans Express. 
"What is asked, it is a regional tour of the Commission. Taking his hearing in Quebec City, the CTQ discourages or prevents concerned citizens and mobilized to intervene on the subject. It's unfair and unjustifiable, "also required Gaétan Lelièvre.
