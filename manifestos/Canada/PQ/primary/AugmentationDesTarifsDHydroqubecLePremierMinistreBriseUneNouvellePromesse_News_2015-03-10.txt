Quebec- The member for Marie-Victorin and the official opposition on energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, denounces the fact that the Liberal government has again broken an election promise, while tariffs. Hydro-Québec will increase by 2.9% on April 1st. 
"What Quebeckers are wondering, so rates are increasing, while Hydro-Québec made a record year in terms of profits. In addition, this new increase hit all families, especially those of the middle class. The Prime Minister, however, had promised to limit to indexing the increase in tariffs. This broken promise adds to a long list. How can we continue to trust the Prime Minister? The Liberal government must stop Piger in the pocket of workers and families, "said Bernard Drainville. 
Recall that the Liberal Party promised, in 2012, to thaw the price of the heritage bloc, which would have led to a 20% increase in Hydro-Québec rates; The government of the Parti Québécois has canceled this unacceptable increase. 
Rates for large houses  "In addition, the signals sent by the government and its energy minister, Pierre Arcand, have something to worry; The possibility of setting up a tariff for large houses. The minister, moreover, has not always explained to us what a big house was. Clearly, we want to use the pretext of energy efficiency to tax even more families in Quebec, "added Bernard Drainville. 
It should be noted that the increase announced by the Energy Board results first and foremost from the liberal mismanagement of wind projects granted under Jean Charest, one at a faremal price of 11.1 cents / kWh. "In comparison, the last call for tenders launched by the Government of the Parti Québécois has concluded at 6.3 cents / kWh, thus demonstrating the competitiveness of wind energy compared to new hydroelectric projects, including the Romaine" , concluded the member for Marie-Victorin.
