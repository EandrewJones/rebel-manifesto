They come from all disciplines and universities: from Laval University to UQAM, McGill University, HEC Montréal, UQAT, UQAR, Téluq, ENAP, etc. The Minister of Education must hear this powerful message from university professors and cease the cuts that directly affect the quality of higher education in Quebec, "said Clouter.
