Quebec- The member of Pointe-Aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for primary and secondary education, Nicole Léger, has expressed concerns for students, teachers, support staff and schools Quebec, on the eve of the deposit of the budget of the Minister of Finance. 
In fact, the words of the last days of the Minister of Education do not reassure the environment of education and the families of Quebec. When asked if any compressions are coming in the next budget, he replied, "I remember very well that there were very good years ago. The years, right now, are a little more difficult. I think Quebeckers are not made of chocolate. » 
This statement reacted Nicole light. "Will the minister reassure the community of Quebec's education and families, and tell us that there will be no other compressions in student services? Can he confirm that he does not intend to raise the number of students in classes? She asked. 
Recall that the predecessor of François Blais used to improvise and ignore his partners. "The latest compressions of Ex-Minister Yves Bolduc, including homework assistance, food aid and school libraries, have hurt. His intentions, among other things, to merge school boards and increase the master ratio? Students, were never clear and seemed to have been written on a corner of the table. The new Minister of Education must restore the situation and confirm that students will be spared, "concluded Nicole Léger.
