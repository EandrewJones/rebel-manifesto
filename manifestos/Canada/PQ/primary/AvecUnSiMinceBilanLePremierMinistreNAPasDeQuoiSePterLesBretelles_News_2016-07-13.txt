Quebec, on July 13, 2016 - Member of Parliament for Vachon and spokesperson for transport and maritime strategy, Martine Ouellet, is surprising that Prime Minister Philippe Couillard vents the merits of his maritime strategy in Europe, in s 'Assigning investments that are not his responsibility, since they come in vast majority of the Canadian government. 
"The Prime Minister struts in Europe while he is unable to repair the Rimouski dock, the flagship city of Quebec expertise. How can it, in its maritime strategy, attribute the merit of these investments in federal infrastructure? For the rest, it is an amalgam of ads that it uses to artificially inflate its strategy. In addition, these announcements come mainly from the tourist strategy put in place by the Parti Québécois government, "said Martine Ouellet. 
"It's the way to make this government, hollow words, empty ads. The Liberals are not even able to adjust the protection of the beluga reproduction area to Cacouna. They insist to make a logistical pole in Soulanges which, in addition to being located on the best farmland in the region, promotes the port of New York at the expense of the port of Montreal. Not to mention the many sagas of the ferry company: cost overruns, bad communication in orders, rates ramps. For a real maritime strategy, all our assets must be repatriated: ports, docks, maritime way, and to do so, Quebec must be independent, "she concluded.
