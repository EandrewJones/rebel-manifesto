Québec -Alors that the decommissioning scenario of Gentilly-2 is increasingly likely, the Parti Québécois calls now a plan for diversification of employment to allow the Center-du-Québec and to the Mauricie a smooth transition arising from the decommissioning of the Gentilly-2 nuclear power plant in Bécancour. 
"With the answers given by Minister Clément Gignac for a few days, it appears quite clear that the Liberal government is seriously juggling with the idea of not rehabilitating the nuclear power plant. In order to limit impacts for the 800 workers, the government must, right now, work on an economic diversification plan. It is possible to do it and that's what the Parti Québécois asks, "said the member for Marie-Victorin and the official opposition spokeswoman Bernard Drainville. 
He recalled that last May, the Leader of the Official Opposition, Pauline Marois, promoted the need for the region that an economic fund of $ 200 million is set up specifically for the central diversification of the central -Chebec and Mauricie. 
"We strongly believe the potential of the region to get up from a closure of the nuclear power plant. Renewable energies offer a real opportunity for the region as for the whole Quebec. With communities, with starters, we will be able to diversify the regional economy and create more jobs than the closure will result, "concluded Bernard Drainville.
