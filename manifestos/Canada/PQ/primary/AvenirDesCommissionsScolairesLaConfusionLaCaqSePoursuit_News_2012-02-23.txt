Québec- "It is the cacophony within the CAQ: while the party's program proposes the abolition of the school boards, the member for the Peltrie proposed the adoption, by motion to the National Assembly, a revision their mandate and responsibilities. With as much confusion, how to mobilize the world of education to the success of our students? » 
This is what the member for Jonquière and spokesperson for the official opposition in terms of primary and secondary education, Sylvain Gaudreault, in response to the motion presented by the CAQ and debated this afternoon. 
Note in passing that half of the Caquist caucus was absent during this vote while the CAQ puts this issue at the top of its priorities in education. "François Legault must explain to us why this lack of discipline," said the member for Jonquière. 
He recalled that it was under a government of the Parti Québécois that half of the school boards disappeared at the end of the 1990s. There were 153 at the time. "It's a major gesture that was placed by Pauline Marois. It looks like for the Cavoists, because it does not come from François Legault, it does not count, "continued Sylvain Gaudreault. 
It argues that the presence of school boards on Quebec meets the desire for decentralization and the need for equitable distribution of resources in the territory. "Privilege maintaining does not mean the status quo in the management of these organizations. There are efficiency gains to do. Changes are needed so that school boards are gaining legitimacy and that schools have more autonomy, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
"Our primary goal should aim for academic success and perseverance in the forefront of all actions affecting the public school system. To see the education only from a bureaucratic point of view plunges us into a debate as sterile as it does not help the success of our students, "concluded the hon. Member for Jonquière.
