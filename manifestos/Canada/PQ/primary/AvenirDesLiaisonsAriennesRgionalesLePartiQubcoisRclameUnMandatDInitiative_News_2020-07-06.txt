Quebec, on July 6, 2020 - as a member of the Committee on Transport and the Environment (CTE), the member for the Madeleine Islands and spokespersons of the Quebecois Party on Transport, Joël Arseneau, Requests an initiative mandate so that its members can look at the future of air links to and between the regions of Quebec, a crucial issue for the occupation and development of our vast territory. 
Following Air Canada's decision, which announced last week the suspension of 8 links and 3 regional stops in Quebec, the Parti Québécois is of the opinion that we must now consider a 100% Quebec solution, In order to secure and sustain the offer of air services in the region. "It's time to take things in hand and set up a real national air transport policy, so that the interests of the regions of Quebec cease to be violated by bad corporate citizens like Air Canada," said Joel. Arseneau. 
With this in mind, the member has filed an application for the CTE, of which he is a member, obtain an initiative mandate in this regard. "The government must take this opportunity to prove that economically, it is nationalist; I ask him to take his responsibilities and act concretely to ensure the maintenance of regional air links, essential for our economy as well as for the occupation and development of the territory. A mandate of initiative on regional air transport would allow elected officials to hear the main regional stakeholders as well as experts, and to find sustainable solutions guaranteeing stability on regional air services, as well as their sustainability, " he pursued. 
Joël Arseneau also notes that although it is necessary, the assistance program for the maintenance of essential regional air services during the health emergency is not sufficient. "First of all, by means that sustainable solutions are found, the Government of Quebec must expand the scope of this program to Air Canada abandoned links and finance it adequately, to ensure a certain cost-effectiveness to the companies that will eventually take the Air Canada Relay - from whom we do not have anything to expect, obviously, "concluded the member for the Madeleine Islands.
