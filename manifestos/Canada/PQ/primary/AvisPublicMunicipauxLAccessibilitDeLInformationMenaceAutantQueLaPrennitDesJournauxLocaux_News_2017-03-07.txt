Quebec, on March 7, 2017- "As the written media go through a very difficult period because of the technological changes, Martin Coiteous adds and removes a significant source of income: the public notices of municipalities. It is inadmissible, especially since it deprives citizens of a reliable and accessible source of information, "have lamented the spokesmen of the Parti Party in terms of municipal affairs, Martin Ouellet, and the development of the regions , Sylvain Gaudreault. 
"Written media are still those who join the greatest number of citizens, particularly in the region and rural areas. In the future, citizens will have to look for themselves on the information on the websites of municipalities. Municipal public notices will become? Research advice? For citizens. There is no one today who has the reflex to go see the websites of the municipalities. And, internet not being a free service, we would now pay citizens to have access to information about their living environment? It's foolish! , "Said Martin Ouellet. 
"In Bill 122, at the current study, the government allows municipalities to disseminate their public notices only on the Internet. Result? Overnight, a significant source of income for local media and a key public service will disappear. By this decision alone, the Liberal Government financially compromises the maintenance of a considerable number of regional press rooms, "continued Sylvain Gaudreault. 
"The amounts associated with the publication of public notices in newspapers, however, represent only 0.05% of municipal budgets. To properly inform citizens, it's very little. It is also a question of presence and diversification of information in general in the regions of Quebec, "concluded Martin Ouellet.
