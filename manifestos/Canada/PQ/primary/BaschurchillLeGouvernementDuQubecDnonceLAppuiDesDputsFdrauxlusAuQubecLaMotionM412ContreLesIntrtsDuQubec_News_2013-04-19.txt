"The federal government will finance Newfoundland hydropower while Quebeckers have always paid themselves for their electricity. It is unacceptable, they are taxes and taxes of Quebeckers who will be used to create unfair competition in Hydro-Québec, "said Minister Cloutier. 
"It is indecent, seventy Federal Quebec members voted for a motion that welcomes the granting of a loan that allows for direct competition to Quebec's energy for a project whose profitability is doubtful. Quebec Federal MPs have ignored a unanimous motion of the National Assembly, "added Minister Martine Ouellet. 
There is a Quebec consensus condemning the granting of a federal loan guarantee. A second motion reiterating the opposition of Quebec to a financial participation of the federal government in the Bas-Churchill hydroelectric project was unanimously adopted last November at the National Assembly.
