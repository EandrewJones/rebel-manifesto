Quebec- The National Assembly adopts the law on the recovery of work in the construction industry (PDF). "Thanks to the action of the government, all construction sites will be open from Tuesday morning; We have to rejoice, "said the premier. 
Throughout the conflict, the Government of Quebec has acted responsibly and reasonably for the parties to come to a negotiated solution. Employer associations in the residential areas, roads and civil engineering and the union covenant have reached nearly 100,000 workers to return to the jobs in the early week. 
As a solution to the impasse in the negotiations in the industrial and institutional sectors, the Quebec government proposed a bill to sustainably restore peace and stability on all construction sites until 2017. The Tandem Plq-Caq has rather decided to opt, without compromise, for a short-term solution that prolongs the uncertainty about the working conditions of thousands of workers. 
"The attitude of Philippe Couillard in the debate surrounding the adoption of the special law demonstrates once again that nothing has changed to the PLQ. We always try to persist the confrontations and bet on the division. We had the opportunity to bring back calm and serenity into relations between workers and employers. The Liberal opposition preferred the uncertainty, instability and its partisan interests instead of lasting peace on the building sites, the dynamism of the economy and the best interests of Quebeckers, "continued the Minister of Labor, Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Agn√®s Maltese. 
"I welcome the efforts of the Minister of Labor, Employment and Social Solidarity to resolve this conflict. We have always placed the general interest before anything else. We will make every effort to enable parties to continue their negotiations this year, "concluded Pauline Marois.
