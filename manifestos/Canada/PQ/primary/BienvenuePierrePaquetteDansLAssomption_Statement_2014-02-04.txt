Tonight, I have the great pleasure of being at the Assumption to announce a very good news to the citizens of the constituency. In the next election, they will have the opportunity to support a very high quality candidate, a man with a busy roadmap, which devoted himself to the cause of Quebec and serving the Lanaudi√®re region. It is also a citizen who has always been interested in economic development, as a teacher as a trade unionist or communicator, a great sovereignist who has never gave up to the defeatist speech and who believes in the great potential of our people: Pierre Paquette. 
I'm glad he joins us, while Quebec's economy is in a crucial period. Pierre Paquette had an obsession throughout his professional life, and this obsession is the job. It's our obsession with us too. 
Create more wealth to have more to share, it is a constant concern, in each of the gestures we ask. What we want is to strengthen Quebec to make it a richer country! 
We do not spare any effort, we do not retreat before any obstacles. We reject the negative speeches, those who say that Quebec is not capable, that its workers are not productive enough or that we are too generous to each other. 
We are not complacent; The challenges of Quebec, we see them like everyone else. The difference is that before these challenges, we do not lower your arms. 
We have a positive project, which offers Quebeckers to take charge and go to the end of themselves. A project that relies on a history, language, culture, values. This project is to make Quebec a richer, more solidarity and proud country!
