Rouyn-Noranda- One year Dour day Since his election as a member of Parliament, Gilles Chapadeau presents the balance sheet of his work for Rouyn-Noranda and the Témiscamingue. 
"It is for me an honor and a great pride to work every day for the people of Rouyn-Noranda and the Témiscamingue. All my life, I made a duty and responsibility to account for my work and communicate with transparency all of my actions. It is therefore natural to me to do so as a member of Parliament, "says Chapadeau. 
"As I am a man of action, it is under this theme that I take stock of my first year. Things have moved since September 4, 2012, our government has been active on many fronts at a time. I think like many, I was hungry for nine years of Liberal regime, "says the member. 
"I am convinced that this exercise will be one of a long series, because I deeply believe that the elected officials have the duty to report on their actions towards the citizens they represent. I introduced myself in politics to work with rigor and integrity in the interest of people from home and I believe that gestures like the one I pose today with this assessment testifies, "says Gilles Chapadeau.
