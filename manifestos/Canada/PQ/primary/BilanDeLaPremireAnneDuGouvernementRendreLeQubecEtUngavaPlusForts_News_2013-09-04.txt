Chibougamau- The hon. Member for Ungava, Mr. Luc Ferland is very happy with the first year's balance sheet of his government. Many things have been accomplished.

Today, the Quebec government has again a way to act so that Quebeckers find their pride. Priorities are clear: the economy and job creation, solidarity and help with those who are in need, and the pride of living together. Thus, the Parti Québécois government will take all the necessary actions to make Quebec stronger. 
"Our government has made big changes by giving an important place to our riding. I am particularly proud of the adoption of Bill 42 on the creation of the Regional Government Eeyou Istchee Baie-James, which ensures that a Jamesian and Cree structure will be put in place and adapted to the challenges and challenges of the territory. , as well as a publicly municipal management structure, explicitly providing for aboriginal and non-Aboriginal representation, which is an important step in a dynamic, harmonious and respectful nation-friendly relationship, "Ferland explained. 
In addition, as Parliamentary Adjoint to the Minister of Natural Resources (Northern Affairs Component), Mrs. Martine Ouellet, Mr. Ferland welcomes the creation of the Nordic Development Secretariat. 
Also, Quebec as a whole wins in terms of ethics, prosperity and solidarity.
