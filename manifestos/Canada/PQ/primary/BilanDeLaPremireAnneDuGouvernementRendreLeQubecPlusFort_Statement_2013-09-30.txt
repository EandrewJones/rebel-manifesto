On September 4, 2012, Pauline Marois became the first woman premier of Quebec's history. After discovering a $ 1.6 billion in public finances, gaping hole left by the Liberals, the Parti Québécois government manages to control expenses and gives itself the means to act to set up its vision . Priorities are clear: the economy and job creation; solidarity and help with those who are in need; identity and measures to better live together. Thus, the government of the Parti Québécois is committed to making Quebec stronger. 
For a year, everywhere in Quebec, change is in progress. The members of the Parti Québécois pose the balance sheet of their first year of work in the Government of Pauline Marois. The results are impressive. And that's just the beginning. 
You will first find the balance sheet by region and riding, and then the government's full balance sheet.
