Québec-Diane Lamarre, Member of Parliament for Quéilli Québécois in the field of health and accessibility to care, draws up a pitiful assessment of this parliamentary session for patients. 
The liberal record is: 
"We are forced to see the lamentable failure of the Minister Barrette who, despite his strong methods and despotism, is only harming access for patients. Another session "All to doctors, cuts in patient services", denounced Diane Lamarre. 
"After abolishing all the institutional associations - that he considered discordant and disturbing voices, but who were, in fact, the vigilant evaluators who gave us the right time -, now the minister. Its is taken to the last guard dog in the network, the Commissioner for Health and Wellbeing, created by Philippe Couillard himself while he was Minister of Health. Why muzzle criticism? If it is so confident about its reforms, the minister barrette should not be afraid we are evaluated, "added the spokesman. 
"For its part, the Parti Québécois has been proactive and introduced Bill 691 this spring to eliminate the regulatory power that the minister had given the minister to dictate a list of fees incidental to pay by patients. We also pleaded for better use of other front-line professionals, including psychologists, paramedics, social workers, nurses and pharmacists. And we claimed the maintenance of the Sabsa Clinic, "said the member. 
"How is it that Philippe Couillard leaves Gaétan barrette to destroy our public health network? Did he lose control of his omnipotent minister? We can do so much better. The solutions exist and would have yielded results, but the model imposed by the minister is disconnected from people, expensive and without tangible results for patients. One thing is certain: we will continue our work with rigor and vigilance to bring solutions actually oriented towards the citizens, "concluded the hon. Member.
