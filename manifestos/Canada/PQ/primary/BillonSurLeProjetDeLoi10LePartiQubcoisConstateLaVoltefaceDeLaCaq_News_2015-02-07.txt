Québec- The hon. Member for Taschereau and Parliamentary Leader of the Official Opposition, Agnès Maltais, says the Four Future Québec Coalition (CAQ) on Bill 10 of Minister Gaétan Barrette. 
"Having supported the Minister with enthusiasm since the filing of his bill last September, the members of the CAQ finally gone to the arguments conveyed by the groups encountered and by the Parti Québécois, according to which the Minister's bill of the Minister Barrette does not answer any of Quebec's concerns in terms of health system effectiveness, "said the member. 
Indeed, this morning, the spokesman for the CAQ, François Paradis, finally confessed that the Government's bill does not provide a solution to improve the governance of the Quebec health system, and said that its party envisaged to vote against. 
"After claiming the multiplication of CISS throughout the detailed study of Bill 10, the CAQ and its new spokesperson, François Paradis, have finally noticed the minister's inability to demonstrate the usefulness of new structures. that he proposes. Finally, after having unconditionally supported the Liberal austerity program it himself inspired, the CAQ head opposes one of the counterproductive measures that the government has presented since its entry. We wish at least, this time, the CAQ keeps the course and vote against this bad bill at the conclusion of the gag, "added Agnès Maltais.
