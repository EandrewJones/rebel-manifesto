Quebec- The member for Terrebonne and sentence of the official family opposition, Mathieu Traversy, denounces the adoption under branch of Bill 28, which will ensure that child care will cost up to $ 20 Per day, a pricing shock of several thousand dollars a year for families in the Quebec middle class. 
The hon. Member stresses that as of Bill 10, also adopted under gag, we do not know how the reform applied by Bill 28. "The government did not explain to Quebeckers. Obviously, Philippe Couillard and his ministers improvising, "he said. 
"What's more, the government breaks another election promise, which has committed to limiting increased tariffs to indexing. In addition, he never explained to the parents how will his new family tax be calculated. What will happen, for example, for reconstituted couples? The article by article study would have helped to answer this question and many others, but the government refused to complete it, preferring to impose a gag. Neither the Minister of Finance nor the Minister of the Family could not, today answer our questions, "continued Mathieu Traversy. 
The member also regrets that at the beginning of the accelerated detailed study, this afternoon, the government pushed its bad faith until refusing to first address Chapter VI, which deals with child care. "Unfortunately, Quebec families will have no response; They will only obtain the assurance that they will have to pay a new liberal family tax, without knowing the amount or how it will be calculated, "he concluded.
