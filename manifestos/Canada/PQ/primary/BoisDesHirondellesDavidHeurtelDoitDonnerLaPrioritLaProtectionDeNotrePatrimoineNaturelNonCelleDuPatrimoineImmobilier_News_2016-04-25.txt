Qu√©bec-Mathieu Traversy, spokesman for the Quebecois on sustainable development, environment and climate change development, calls on the Minister of the Environment, David Heurtel, to protect the natural heritage of the Woodland of the Hirondelles of Saint -Bruno-de-Montarville, not protecting the real estate heritage of a private promoter. 
The member for Terrebonne reminds the Minister his own decision of July 2015 concerning the projected real estate development in this sector. David Heurtel then endorsed the detailed scientific opinion of his officials, concluding that "the intervention projected by the real estate developer may severely degrade a natural environment which is distinguished by the fact that its characteristics promote the survival of Ginseng to five leaflets, A rare biophysical characteristic and exceptional interest ". 
"The Minister must be consistent with his 2015 decision and declare that projected real estate development would be incompatible with the protection of this floristic species. Its role is to base its decision on the best available scientific information, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
The member also points out that Quebec has with laws that protect our natural heritage. "David Heurtel must enforce the laws that aim to preserve the natural environments. Give the green light to this project would mean that it does not care about the protection of our biodiversity, "he continued. 
Mathieu Traversy adds that the real estate development in the Woodland of the Swallows would be incompatible with the desired will of the citizens, the environmental organizations and the elected representatives of the Greater Montreal area to set up a green and blue belt to connect the natural environments between them.. "David Heurtel must not fragment the natural environments. Give the authorization to this real estate development would further compromise the development of a green and blue belt, "he concluded.
