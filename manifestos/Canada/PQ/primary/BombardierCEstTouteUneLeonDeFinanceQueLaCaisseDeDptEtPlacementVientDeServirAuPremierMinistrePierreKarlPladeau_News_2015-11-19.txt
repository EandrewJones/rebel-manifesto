Quebec- In response to the announcement made jointly this morning by the Fund of Filing and Investment of Quebec and Bombardier, the Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, judges that this agreement proves that Liberal Prime Minister Philippe Couillard and his Government do not have economic jurisdiction or financial for direct Quebec. 
"Rather than assuming all risks in the C Series program - and investing in a developing program that includes no performance guarantee, as the government did - the applicant of the Caisse, C ' is the vast majority of Quebeckers who contribute to the Régie des Antes, will have the guarantee of a return of at least 9.5% and to obtain the value increase of a company that generates more than 6 billions in revenue and more than 600 million in operating benefits. It is a whole lesson of finance that the Fund has just served with the Minister of the Economy. The Prime Minister says the fund will support jobs in Germany and not in Quebec. Yet, Bombardier Transport employed more than 1300 people in La Pocatière and Saint-Bruno. Philippe Couillard does he ignore him? ", Questioned the leader of the official opposition. 
"While all the details of the Fund's understanding were announced this morning, we still do not have the beginning of a detail on that concluded by the government for the C Series. The Prime Minister went astray to be transparent; When will he publicize the details of this transaction? , "Added the leader of the official opposition. 
"The only information that the Prime Minister has provided us on its investment of 1.3 billion, is that it was in a stash, by its Minister of the Economy, without the expertise required for a transaction too sophisticated. At the glow of the investment announced by the Fund, the Prime Minister must tell us how he can maintain his confidence in his minister, "concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
