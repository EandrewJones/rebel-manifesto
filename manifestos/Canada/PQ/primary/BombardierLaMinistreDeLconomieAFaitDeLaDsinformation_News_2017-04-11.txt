Quebec, on April 11, 2017- The spokesman for the Parti Québécois in finance, Nicolas Marceau, and the spokesperson in the field of economy, Alain Therrien, denounced the disinformation maneuver used by the Minister of the Economy, Dominique Anglade, in the salary file of the senior leaders of Bombardier and the bonuses paid to them. 
IN SHORT 
"Yesterday, the minister said that" Quebeckers will not pay bombardier leaders as long as they will not make money [with CSeries] ". However, in the declaration of significant changes unveiled last night by Bombardier, we have the confirmation of the contrary: all the leaders of the company will receive their bonuses, as expected, from the annual incentive scheme. It was nearly $ 7 million in bonuses for 2016. And no part of this amount is postponed in 2020! "Did Nicolas Marceau explained. 
"The Minister confuses long-term variable compensation, based on actions and options, and short-term remuneration, composed of the salary and annual bonuses. At the Management Committee, nor the salaries or annual bonuses have been modified. We rolled in the flour. For a week, Bombardier has been trying to calm the popular grumbling by making misinformation about the salaries of his senior executives. Last week, the Prime Minister was satisfied with the announced measure. Yesterday, the Minister of the Economy said that as long as Quebeckers do not make money, senior executives would not have an increase. When will the Liberal government cease to protect the richest 1%? ", For his part, asked Alain Therrien.
