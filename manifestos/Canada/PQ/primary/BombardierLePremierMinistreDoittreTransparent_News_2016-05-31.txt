Quebec- The official opposition leader and MP, Sylvain Gaudreault, asked for more transparency at Prime Minister of Quebec, Philippe Couillard, as for the help of $ 1.3 billion that his government has granted Bombardier . 
"With regard to the agreement that the government has concluded with the company, we know that it holds an option on 200 million warrants, but we do not know what are the redemption conditions related to the billion that it has invested. But this morning, we learn that the redemption conditions could be as low as a rate of interest by 3% or 4%, which would like to say, in clear, that it is the taxpayers who take all the risks. If it goes wrong, they will assume the consequences but, if everything goes well, they will have no opportunity to enjoy the gains, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
"There are only two possible options: either the redemption conditions have been agreed from the outset - in this case, the Prime Minister must be transparent because it is the taxpayer's money - either Philippe Couillard must admit that the situation is worse than we thought and improvised, using one billion public money. The Prime Minister is not even able to tell Quebeckers who will be their profit if everything is fine and that the company decides to redeem the government's share. What we know, on the other hand, is that we will lose everything if it's wrong, "he added. 
"In October, when the government announced that it would support financially Bombardier, everyone agreed. The problem is that the agreement has been badly negotiated. The deadline for concluding its final version has been expired for a long time. The date of the first payment has been exceeded for two months, and the federal government is always waiting. What is the expected prime minister for taking pressure on Ottawa to get our share of the 50 billion as Quebeckers send it every year? ", Concluded the leader of the official opposition.
