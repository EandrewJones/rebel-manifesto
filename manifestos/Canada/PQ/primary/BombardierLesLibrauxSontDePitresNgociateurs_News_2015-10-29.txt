Quebec- As we learn that the Liberal government of Philippe Couillard has decided to invest one billion dollars, with Bombardier, in the C Series program, the official head of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, deplores the Liberals have chosen to have all the risks to the Quebecers. 
The money will be invested in a new corporate shell specifically created to receive government money, rather than in the parent company. Thus, the Liberal government renounces protecting its investment by the other assets owned by the company. "The problem is that by acting in this way, the government is about to make citizens and taxpayers Québec all the risks, for the benefit of Bombardier's shareholders. It is an unfair transaction, "explained Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"Investing in the aeronautics sector is not bad in itself. I have repeatedly asked the government to act concretely to protect these remunerative jobs for Quebeckers. But I never said that the state had to take all the risks, "said the official opposition. 
Note also that neither the federal government nor the Fund and Investment are stakeholders of this agreement. "The Prime Minister and his minister of the economy have signed a very bad deal. They decidedly understand nothing to finance or economy, "concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
