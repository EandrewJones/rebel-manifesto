Quebec- The Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, again asked the Liberal Prime Minister Philippe Couillard to make public the details of the agreement between the Government and Bombardier, after we have learned that 'Company will relocate even more activities to low cost production countries, such as Mexico, Morocco and India. 
"This information is rather surprising, given the fact that the Prime Minister claims to have protected jobs in Quebec. Just a few days ago, Philippe Couillard reproached the Caisse de filing for having invested in Bombardier Transport, whose operational headquarters are located in Germany. He forgot to mention that for his part, he financed Bombardier up to 1.3 billion to create jobs in Mexico, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"All this brings us back to the fact that the agreement between the government and Bombardier has still not been disclosed. Can the Prime Minister tell us if the announcement yesterday by Bombardier, who plans to increase his use of low-cost workforce abroad, is consistent with his government? , "Added the leader of the official opposition. 
He again claimed more transparency from the Prime Minister. "This agreement of 1.3 billion, the government has obviously negotiated it with minimum requirements. Quebeckers need to know what the government has demanded in return made on behalf of it, "concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
