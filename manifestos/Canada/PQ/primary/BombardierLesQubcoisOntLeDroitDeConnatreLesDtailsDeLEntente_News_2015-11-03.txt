Quebec- The hon. Member for Saint-Jérôme and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, once again asked the details of the agreement signed by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Philip Couillard in Bombardier's file. 
"Last week, the government announced an investment of $ 1.3 billion in a new joint venture with Bombardier, but that will only understand the C Series program. So, $ 1.3 billion will be invested in a corporate shell without income, while this billion represents a third of Bombardier's market capitalization. While austerity reigns everywhere in Quebec, critics are unanimous: it's a bad deal and it's Quebeckers who will take all risks, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"By consulting the register of insider returns, we learn that on October 5th, three weeks before the announcement of the Prime Minister, 12 directors of Bombardier received more than 373,000 subscription rights at a price 30% lower than that obtained by the government. These directors will pocket a quarter of a million dollars before the government can only make one penny with its own subscription rights. How does the Prime Minister explain this two weights, two measures for the directors of Bombardier? How does it explain that the government's warrants have not been achieved at the current market price, as was the case for Bombardier's directors? ", Continued the leader of the official opposition. 
Pierre Karl Péladeau recalls that several questions remain, including: 
What are the rights of the government under the shareholder agreement? 
What are his rights as to the appointment of directors? 
"Quebeckers argue these questions, they have the right to know. The Prime Minister must make the agreement public, "he concluded.
