Quebec- In the Bombardier record, the official head of the official, Pierre Karl Péladeau, judges that the Prime Minister shows a flagrant lack of respect for Quebeckers. 
"As incredible as it may seem, the Liberal government of Philippe Couillard has invested 1.3 billion in Bombardier, but without asking anything in return to the company. A few weeks later, Bombardier announces 2400 layoffs in Quebec, without even having bothered to inform the government. In addition, the government dropped its action to enforce the law on maintaining Air Canada's maintenance activities in Quebec, at the same time abandoning the 1800 workers in Aveos, "said the head of the official opposition. 
"Yesterday, we were confirmed that after accepting the government's money, Bombardier will close its Cseries' flight test center, the same division in which the government is a partner. So, there are only two possible options: or the government, a 49.5% partner of the CSeries, has no decision weight in the company and makes it laugh at it, or it has a decision-making power , and he approved this transfer of jobs from Quebec to Kansas, despite the significant amount invested by Quebecers. The Prime Minister was unable to tell us whether his Government, which has nearly half of the actions of the CSeries and headquartered to the Board of Directors of Bombardier, approved the closure of the flight test center and its transfer to the United States. It is his duty to keep the population informed, "concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
