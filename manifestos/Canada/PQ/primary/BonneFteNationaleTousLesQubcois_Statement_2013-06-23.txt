In 1977, René Lévesque wanted to give an official character to the Saint-Jean-Baptiste. He wanted to offer him to all Quebeckers and to all Quebeckers, whatever their origin or beliefs. He did the National Quebecers. 
So that's what we now emphasize on June 24 every year. We celebrate this link which, from yesterday to tomorrow, unites all the citizens of Quebec. 
This link is first of all the pride of a past of resistance and successes. Whether by the works of our artists or the genius of our inventors, our voice resonated in French all over the planet. 
It is also a present lived through our talents, our creativity and our originality. We form a proud, prosperous and solidarity people who never ends to surprise and who is able to join the universal thanks to his humanistic values. 
It's also a future of all possible. The 21st century is just beginning and it already announces great challenges and many opportunities. 
A new world offers us. You have to kiss it. 
The biggest conquest of our history is the consciousness that nothing is forbidden. 
Our children can grow with the belief that their ambitions and hopes will not know any limit. As the great nation they are part of. 
On June 24, while the day prevails at night, so here's what we celebrate: a story that unites us and a destiny that brings us together! 
I wish you a good national holiday!
