"On behalf of the whole party of the Parti Québécois, I wish Quebeckers a very nice national holiday. It is without a doubt the opportunity to celebrate our identity and, in particular, the French language which is the base. This language, it resonates in our regions, our metropolis and our capital, but also around the world. For centuries, we have preserved this precious heritage. Let's continue to honor it, to show us worthy of us. 
We form a proud, prosperous and solidarity people. Our story is rich in successes and she unites all the citizens of Quebec. Let us want this story to be more taught and broadcast. To find out where we want to go, the best way is to know where you come from! 
The National Day is also an opportunity to celebrate our collective successes, those who shine our nation on the international scene. Quebeckers are talented and creative; These qualities allow us to stand out and illustrate anywhere in the world. 
I invite the entire population to participate in the many festivities that will take place in all regions of Quebec. Let's take advantage of it to gather and celebrate our history and our future! Stéphane Bédard said.
