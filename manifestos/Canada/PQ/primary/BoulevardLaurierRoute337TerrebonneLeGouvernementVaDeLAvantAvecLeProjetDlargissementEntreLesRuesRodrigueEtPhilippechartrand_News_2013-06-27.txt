The number of channels, the extent required improvements and the need for the addition of turnways are elements to be defined. "The study not only takes into account the 35,000 vehicles that take daily 337 route south of Philippe-Chartrand Street, but also adjacent street movement movements," added Mr. Gaudreault.

My colleague Mathieu Traversy, Member of Parliament for Terrebonne, shares my enthusiasm before today's announcement, which was strongly expected by the environment, "said Ms. Diane Gadoury-Hamelin, member for Masson. 
The preliminary draft will be achieved by the end of 2013. It is at this stage that the schedule and the amount of the investment may be specified.
