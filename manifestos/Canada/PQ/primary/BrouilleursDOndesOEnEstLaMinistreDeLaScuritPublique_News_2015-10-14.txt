Québec- As worries related to safety around Quebec detention centers are felt, the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois public safety, Pascal Bérubé, asks the Minister Lise Thériault to clearly indicate where she is about the installation of cell wave jammers. 
Remember that the Marois government had arrested the federal authorities in order to obtain permission to use these devices. "We want to know exactly where the minister is in this case. What actions has it taken? Did she make representations with the federal government? Did she get something? "Asked Pascal Bérubé. 
We learned this week that the number of flights of drones above the detention centers had increased. "The installation of devices to blur the cell waves could obstruct the illegal activities of certain detainees. First, it would render contraband cells unusable, which allow criminals to continue their illegal activities in prison and even plan an escape. The interference of the waves would also prevent the overview of prisons by drones, since the remote control signal could no longer be captured by the flying machine, "said the member. 
"The disturbing news is accumulating, correctional agents sound the alarm. When will the minister take all necessary measures to reassure the people and prevent evasions or other unfortunate events? ", Concluded Pascal Bérubé.
