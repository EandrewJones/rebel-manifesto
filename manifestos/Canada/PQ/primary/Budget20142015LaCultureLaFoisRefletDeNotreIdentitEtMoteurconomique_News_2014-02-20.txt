Quebec- Quebec identity is largely reflected in our culture. In addition to distinguishing and allowing us to radiate around the world, culture is a powerful engine of our economy. On the occasion of the 2014-2015 budget, the Minister of Finance and the Economy announces a series of measures that testify to the unwavering support of the government with regard to the cultural sector. 
For cultural organizations, the digital revolution represents a crucial challenge of adapting to new means of information and communication. For example, the government will invest $ 150 million to support cultural organizations that need to take the technological turn. The amounts invested will serve in particular to replace the current equipment with digital equipment. 
The digital cultural strategy will be made public soon by the Minister of Culture and Communications. 
In October 2013, the Minister of Culture and Communications announced the enhancement of the Patronage Investments Culture program. This initiative followed one of the recommendations of the Working Group on Cultural Philanthropy, chaired by Mr. Pierre Bourgie, whose report was tabled last June. 
"In order to respond to a large part of the financing needs of cultural organizations, a $ 5 million per year from the specific tobacco tax will now be intended for this program to ensure the sustainability," said the Minister. Marceau. 
The Government confirms that it will renew the agreement between the Ministry of Culture and Communications and Loto-Qu√©bec for the financing of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. The terms of the Agreement will be unveiled soon by the Minister of Culture and Communications.
