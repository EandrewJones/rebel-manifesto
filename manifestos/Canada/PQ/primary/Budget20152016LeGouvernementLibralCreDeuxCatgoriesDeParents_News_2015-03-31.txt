Quebec- The member for Rousseau and the official opposition spokeswoman in the field of finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, as well as the member for Terrebonne and Family Word, Mathieu Traversy, deplore the inequality contained in The Liberal government's budget, which chose to financially promote parents who use non-subsidized child care at the expense of those who use the CPE network. 
Indeed, the tax shield, set up by the Liberal government in its last budget, protects only parents who send their children into the non-subsidized private child care network against a portion of the tax increase resulting from an increase in their income. 
"If, for example, two families receive a salary increase, the one that sends its children into the undeveloped private network will be protected against the decline in its childcare tax credit, while the one that sends them In CPE will not be protected against the increase in its modulated tariff that derives from an increase in its income. Remember that parents who use subsidized daycare places are not entitled to the custody tax credit. This demonstrates the liberal will to promote the private to the detriment of CPE and family environment, "Nicolas Marceau said. 
Mathieu Traversy does not explain that the Minister of Finance gave confused answers to the population, especially since the Minister of the Family did not answer the official opposition issues. 
"The rise in child care rates applies to families who send their children. The Minister of Family must defend the public network and subsidized child care, which she refuses to do since her arrival. Not only has the government modulated rates, but it imposes in addition to new cuts over $ 70 million this year, and 129 million next year. With the Liberals, Quebec's parents will pay more for less service! ", Concluded Mathieu Traversy.
