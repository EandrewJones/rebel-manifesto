Quebec, on April 15, 2015- The member for Taillon and sentence of the official opposition in terms of health and accessibility to care, Diane Lamarre, once again questioned Minister Ga√©tan barrette about the fact that the fact that the Increased health spending, planned in the last Liberal budget, most of them dedicated to the remuneration of physicians. 
"In the budget filed on March 26 by the Minister of Finance, we realize that choices have been made: healthy, more than half of the budget increase is devoted to physician salaries, rather than care and Services for patients. Thus, 10,000 specialist physicians will share $ 210 million, and the 8 million Quebeckers will only be eligible for $ 208 million; The disproportion is flagrant! To pay for specialist doctors, we cut in direct patient services, in the first line, "denounced Diane Lamarre. 
"How does the Minister of Health explain that in austerity, instead of giving priority to Quebec patients, he chose to give rise to salary to his specialist colleagues? She added. 
"Selective austerity, liberal management is that: we pay specialist doctors first, then we give the remaining line and patients. The minister was unable to tell us why he anticipates so little money for care and direct patient care, home care, community organizations. The government cuts in public health, in prevention, it cuts the budget of the health facilities. It cuts in home care, so in the first line; These are facts! For the minister, colleagues first, patients then, "concluded Diane Lamarre.
