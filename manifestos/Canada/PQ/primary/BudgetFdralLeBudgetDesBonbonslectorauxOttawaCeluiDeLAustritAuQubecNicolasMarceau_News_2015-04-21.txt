Quebec- The member for Rousseau and the official opposition for the finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, denounces the fact that the federal government's budget does not take into account the priorities of Quebec. 
"The federal budget confirms the paradox between the two levels of government. We have just voted the austerity budget here in Quebec City; This budget will have real consequences for Quebecers and asphyxiate our economic growth. Meanwhile, in Ottawa, it's the budget of electoral candies. The contrast is striking. The federal government acts in favor of its electoral base; He has no interest in Quebec. The Federal Parliament works without any Quebec influence, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
The member also deplores that Prime Minister Philippe Couillard did not ask for the federal government. "When we ask nothing, we get nothing. It is not surprising to see that Quebec's demands have been ignored by Ottawa. It would have been necessary to talk about health transfers, compensation for the firearms register or toll on the new Champlain Bridge, for example. The impact of the decline in health transfers will be very important in Quebec, where the needs are growing, particularly because of the aging of the population, "the member has entered into.
