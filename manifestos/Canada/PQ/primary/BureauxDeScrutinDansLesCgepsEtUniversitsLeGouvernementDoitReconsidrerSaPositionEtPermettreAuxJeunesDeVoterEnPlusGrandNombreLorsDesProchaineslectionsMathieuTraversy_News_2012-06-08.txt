Quebec- The member for Terrebonne and official opposition spokesman for youth and student affairs, Mathieu Traversy, asks Jean Charest's government to reconsider his position and allow young people to vote in their educational institution during the next election. 
"It's been several years that the Parti Québécois has put forward this proposal to facilitate the vote of young people. Measure that consensus with a majority of organizations whose youth wings of all political parties, including that of the Liberal Party. It is deplorable that only Jean Charest's government is objected to this measure that would increase the participation rate of youth in the election all the more than the Chief Electoral Officer confirmed that the proposal could be carried out during the next election. He said Mathieu Traversy. 
"It is our responsibility as elected officials to promote the participation of all elections in the election including that of younger. There are already similar incentives to facilitate the vote of "snowbirds", military, detainees and some 700 residences for the elderly and CHSLD. Why not do the same in CEGEPs and universities when we know that many students have left their region of origin in order to pursue higher education? He added the member for Terrebonne, referring to Leo Bureau-Blouin and Pier-André Bouchard St-Amant published this morning in the duty. 
"Jean Charest, head of the youth files, has the duty to give all the necessary tools for Quebec students so that they can participate in our democratic life. In the last election, in November 2008, the rate of participation of 18-24 years was only 41.2%. It's less of one in two young people who took advantage of his right to vote. The Prime Minister said that the student crisis was going to settle at the ballot box. He must stop getting objected, leave the partisanship and give the means to young people to participate in greater numbers, "Mathieu Traversy concluded.
