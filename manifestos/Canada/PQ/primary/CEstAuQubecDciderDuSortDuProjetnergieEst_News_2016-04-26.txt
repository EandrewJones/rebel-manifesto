Quebec- Mathieu Traversy, Member of Parliament for Terrebonne and spokesman for the Quebec of Sustainable Development, Environment and Climate Change Fighting, denounces again the Liberal government's refusal to support a motion of the Parti Québécois stipulating Quebec had to have the last word on the energy project is TransCanada. 
"Is it so wonder that a Liberal government does not recognize Quebeckers their freedom to decide? I have already filed two motions similar to the National Assembly on 6 October and 11 November 2015; Both were rejected by the government. Today's refusal is only additional evidence that the government abdals its powers and delegates to the federal level, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
The motion, rejected this afternoon, reads as follows: 
"That the National Assembly asserts that the final approval of the Energy Project is of TransCanada is the responsibility of the Government of Quebec; 
Whether it requires the Minister of the Environment that the mandate of BAPE can cover all the fundamental issues of the project, including upstream and downstream greenhouse gas emissions, economic impacts and First Nations consultation. » 
"We already knew that the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Pierre Arcand, had no pressure on his colleague from the environment, David Heurtel, for the Quebec environmental laws to be respected. It was also known that Minister Heurtel had negotiated with TransCanada to launch an illegal and incomplete BAPE. Moreover, the Parti Québécois denounced for months the fact that the BAPE proposed by the Liberals was one of the junk. Today, the government realizes it and makes Volte-Face, condemning more than 300 memories, colossal work, not to be made public. Unfortunately, it is a surprise for anyone that the government rejected our motion, incapable that it is up to assert that it is in Quebec and Quebeckers to choose, "concluded the member for Terrebonne.
