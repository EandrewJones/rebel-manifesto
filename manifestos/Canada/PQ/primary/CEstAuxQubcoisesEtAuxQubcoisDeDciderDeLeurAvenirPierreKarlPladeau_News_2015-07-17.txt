Quebec- Following the words of the British Columbia Prime Minister, Ms. Christy Clark, about the independence of Quebec, the member for Saint-Jérôme and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, holds to Reaffirm that Quebeckers alone belong to decisions about the political future of the Quebec nation. 
"The independence movement has a legitimate project of emancipation by Quebecers. We have the profound conviction that full political and economic freedom will enrich us collectively. Being a country, we will be able to take our decisions and have all our development levers. The future of our nation does not decide in British Columbia, in Saskatchewan or elsewhere, it decides here, in Quebec, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"This project is not incompatible with the success of the Canadian provinces. Just as there is no incompatibility between openness to the world and the importance for Quebec to talk about its own international voice. I intend to continue the dialogue with the entire Quebec population, but also with our Canadian partners, whenever I have the opportunity to do it, "he added. 
Decisions taken by and for Canada 
"In addition, Quebeckers find the impacts of the decisions made by Canada and the leaving of Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, who has completely forgotten the interests of Quebecers for his commitment to Canadian unity. He agrees that important decisions are taken without even the Quebeckers are consulted, "concluded the official opposition.
