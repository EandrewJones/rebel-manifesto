Quebec, on September 19, 2016 -The Member of Parliament for Rimouski and spokesman for Seniors, Harold Lebel, sorry to see the Liberal government attempting to save a consultation instead of making concrete gestures to improve From now on health care offered to seniors. 
"After cutting nearly $ 1 billion in health care and services for two years, which has hurt seniors, the Liberal government announces today that it will finally consult groups and citizens, And to seek solutions to repair the damage itself caused. It's the world upside down, "Harold Lebel denounced. 
"This maneuver to save time does not understand anyone. We ask the Government to now restore the abolished and unmet positions in CHSLD and home care, stop cutting and reinvesting to avoid other episodes in which elders are forced to eat powdered potatoes, or must wait several weeks or even months, to be able to take a bath, "added the spokesman. 
"While last June, the members of the Health and Social Services Commission, including the Liberal MP by Cr√©mazie, Marie Montpetit, have completed an initiative mandate on the living conditions of people in CHSLD , the government starts again exercising. It is not to understand: Between 2013 and 2016, the Commission heard 36 groups in public hearings, received 38 submissions and visited facilities in four regions of Quebec. And it is not to mention the many reports of the citizen protector who have recommended very concrete actions to improve access to care for seniors. Solution tracks, we have; It is now time to act, "concluded Harold Lebel.
