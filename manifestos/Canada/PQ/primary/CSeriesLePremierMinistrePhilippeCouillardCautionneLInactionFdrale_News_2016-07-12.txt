Québec- The member for Sanguinet and spokesman for the Québécois parties in the area of Economics, Alain Therrien, denounces Prime Minister Philippe Couillard who drops his arms by bonding the inaction of the Federal for his share of investment in the C Series. 
"While everyone is asking the federal government to do its share, Prime Minister Philippe Couillard said the company did not need it now. How can he hope to maintain the pressure? That said, the Liberal Prime Minister, choosing the preservation of Canadian unity to the detriment of the interests of Quebecers, has not put everything pressure on his federal counterpart. He preferred to wait, contenting with hollow words. This time, he immediately approved the lack of consideration of Justin Trudeau's government, "said Alain Therrien. 
"What the Prime Minister's comments mean is that our flagship, a great pride of Quebec, would have to wait until the lack of liquidity strikes him before hoping for the help of the federal. What confidence does this inspire customers and future buyers? On our side, we continue to highlight the federal government so that it invests in the C Series. Quebeckers send $ 50 billion a year in Ottawa, the federal government must absolutely invest some here in Bombardier, as it is generously investing in the Ontario automotive sector, "concluded the member.
