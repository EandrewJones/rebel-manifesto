Montreal - "The only real party capable of defending the interests of Quebecers in Ottawa, it is the Bloc Québécois. It is not the Liberal Party, neither the Conservative Party and even less the new democratic party. By the way, I am very surprised to hear a supposedly sovereignist party, such as Quebec Solidarity, support the NDP, a Toronto Federalist Federalist Party, "Pauline Marois said, leader of the Quebecois party, at the time she exercised his right to vote. 
"While everything becomes possible and that the Parti Québécois is getting closer to power in Quebec City, it is not time for sovereignists to give up the game. As part of the federal election, I invite you to make the choice of Quebec, to vote for the interests of our nation, for our values, to vote Bloc Québécois. With a conservative majority, Quebec would be losing. Daily, Stephen Harper's party shows us the demonstration of his misunderstanding of Quebec reality. The only way to prevent the majority is to highlight as many members of the Bloc Québécois who, with Gilles Duceppe, will be held for Quebec, "concluded Ms. Marois.
