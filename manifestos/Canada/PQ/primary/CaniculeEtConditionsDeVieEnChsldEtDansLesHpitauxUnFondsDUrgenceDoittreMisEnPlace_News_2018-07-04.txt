The official opposition spokesperson for social services, Dave Turcotte, and the seniors' spokesperson, Harold Lebel, ask the Minister of Health and Social Services, Gaétan Barrette, to set up a fund emergency intended for the directions of the health facilities, in order to allow them to fight more effectively against the heat. 
IN SHORT 
"Quebec is going through a historic heat wave; But even though this heat had been announced, several people, including seniors, suffer a lot. Given the fact that these heat episodes are called upon to be repeated in the future, we ask the Liberal government to set up an emergency fund: all health facilities in Quebec, CHSLD and hospitals, must be able to adequately coolish their Spaces, to ensure the comfort of both patients and workers. It's essential, "said Dave Turcotte. 
"We are seeing it every day: the state of CHSLDs and hospitals deteriorates to an eye view. Establishments are obsolete, unsuitable, sometimes even dangerous. And the austerity imposed on us by the Liberal government in recent years has certainly not helped to remedy the situation! After 15 years of liberal reign, the Minister of Health must take stock and give us the time just as to the state of the network. In 2018, in Quebec, it is unacceptable that health institutions do not all have adequate air conditioning, "said Harold Lebel, reminiscent of the Quebec party asked for a survey several weeks ago. of the Protector of the Citizen on the global situation of CHSLDs. 
Dave Turcotte is categorical: never more elders and other Quebec patients should relive such a situation. "A Parti Québécois government will put in place a plan, deployed over one year, so that all health facilities can have an effective air conditioning system. It's necessary, of course, but it's mostly human, "he concluded.
