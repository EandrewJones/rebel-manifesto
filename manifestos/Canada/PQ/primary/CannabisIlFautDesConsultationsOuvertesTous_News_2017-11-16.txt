Quebec, November 16, 2017 -The official opposition for public health and prevention, Sylvain Pagé, asks the government to open consultations for the Cannabis Bill to all citizens of Quebec . 
IN SHORT 
"We have asked the Liberal government that consultations on the Cannabis Bill are open to all citizens of Quebec. Those who were held in some areas did not carry on the bill since no one knew at that time what it would contain. That said, we welcome the fact that several recommendations from the Parti Québécois plan are found in the bill, as the fact that a corporation is responsible for distribution, "said Sylvain Pagé. 
"On the other hand, he continued, the government seems to have abdicated the federal government as to control the authorizations in terms of production. Now that this production is nothing but for medicinal purposes, there is no reason for the federal government to get involved. There are jobs to create for regions; Do not let the federal force us to supply ourselves outside Quebec. It would be a nonsense! » 
"There are also several aspects of the bill that will need to be improved and clarified. The lack of precision as to workplace use is a source of concern, both among leaders and workers. The same goes for online sales, as well as coaching relative to housing and condominiums. Citizens want clearer tags and it is the mandate we give ourselves for the study of this bill, "added the spokesman. 
"We have a clear position that cannabis should not become a source of important profits for the government. That's why we are surprised to note that only a share of cannabis sales will be devoted to health and public safety prevention and research. Finally, it is deplorable that at the time of the deposit of the bill, the Government has no economic scenario with respect to the price, taxation and income-sharing, particularly with municipalities, which will have significant charges. Assume in connection with cannabis, "concluded Sylvain Pagé.
