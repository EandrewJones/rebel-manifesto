Quebec, on March 1, 2019 - the member for Jonquière and spokesperson for the second energy group in terms of energy, Sylvain Gaudreault, announced that he would sponsor and support a petition asking the Government of François Legault to repay. Québécois the $ 1.7 billion perceived by Hydro-Québec. 
IN SHORT 
Hydro-Québec, a Crown corporation, belongs to all Quebeckers; Sylvain Gaudreault estimates that, in this capacity, she can not keep this money in her coffers. "Since 2005, Quebec consumers have paid nearly $ 1.7 billion in Hydro-Québec, while they are technically proprietary. This money must come back to them in full. There is no other way of considering the situation, "he said. 
The spokesman recalled that the CAQ shared this point of view when it was in the opposition. "The Caquists burst into a room to claim a complete refund of the overpayments. Even in 2017, through a petition, the Calciste Deputy of Saint-Hyacinthe, Chantal Soucy, had harvested more than 47,000 signatures for this purpose! What happened for the CAQ to change his shoulder rifle? Is it just because she took power? This turnaround turn is totally incomprehensible and unacceptable, "he insisted. 
"During the 39 days of the election campaign, François Legault hammered that he wanted to put money back into the pockets of the citizens. Today, he has a golden opportunity to honor his promise. His government must amend the law to require Hydro-Québec to return 100% of overpayments to Quebeckers and Quebeckers, "concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
