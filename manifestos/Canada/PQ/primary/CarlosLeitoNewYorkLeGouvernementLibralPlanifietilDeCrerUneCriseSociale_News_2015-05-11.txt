Quebec- The member for Rousseau and the official opposition spokesman in the field of finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, and the member for Sanguinet and Spokesman for Treasury Board, Alain Therien, ask the Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, to clarify the intentions of the Liberal government, when he invited New York investors, during his passage in the American metropolis, to prepare for a "hot autumn" in Quebec. 
"In announcing the holding of demonstrations, does the Minister of Finance tell us that his government has no intention of negotiating in good faith with state employees, as the law requires it? Does the government, as it did in 2012, during the student crisis, intends to use the negotiations with its employees as a political tool to divide the population? The duty of a responsible government, on the contrary, is to try to create consensus, to arouse admonition to a common will, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
"The Liberals have made division and confrontation their trademarks. While Minister Leitão already presumes the negative outcome of the negotiations with his employees, to whom he absolutely offers nothing over two years, remember that his government will increase, again this year, the salary of doctors of $ 327 million; This sum is equivalent to 43% of new money spent on the new program expenses of all departments, "concluded Alain Therien.
