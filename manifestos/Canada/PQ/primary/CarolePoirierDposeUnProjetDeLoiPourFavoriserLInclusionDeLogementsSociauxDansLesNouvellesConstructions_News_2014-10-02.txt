Quebec- The hon. Member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and sentence of the official opposition in housing, Carole Poirier, has tabled today a bill that promotes the inclusion of social or affordable housing in new projects of construction. 
"Social housing needs are very important, not only in large cities, but also in the regions of Quebec. The bill gives an additional tool to municipalities so that they can get along with the proponents so that new buildings include social housing, "said Carole Poirier. 
Bill 194 allows municipalities to negotiate an agreement with the proponents of new constructions so that they provide for inclusion, in their projects, a specific number of social or affordable housing, or the construction of such units elsewhere in the territory of the municipality. Thus, social diversity will be fostered in new construction projects and residential development more adapted to the realities of communities. 
"I hope that Minister Pierre Moreau and the government will demonstrate openness, just like all parliamentarians. The bill must quickly be called by the government so that we can study it and adopt it, "concluded Carole Poirier.
