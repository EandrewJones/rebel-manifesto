Montreal - "The Castillo family represents what Quebec society expects new Quebecers. It has integrated and is an asset for our community. Expel it would be a drama for the whole family and a huge loss for us. That's why I asked the Minister of Immigration and Cultural Communities of Quebec, Ms. Kathleen Weil, to support our approach. In this regard, I challenged the minister who said he was interested in meeting the family. I therefore ask him to intervene as soon as possible, "said the member of the Quebecois Party of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Carole Poirier. 
"The Federal Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has discretion and can put an end to the anxiety of the Castillo family. The expulsion notification is for the 15th of June, the minister must do quickly and accept the request of the family, "added Ms. Poirier. The Castillo family arrived four years ago in Montreal. Family members made a request as refugees since their lives were threatened in Mexico. The treatment of their demand has been dragging since then and it is barely a few weeks ago that they learned that they were refused and that they had to leave Canada for June 15. 
"The three Children Castillo frequent the Montreal School Board and are appreciated by all their comrades, said Daniel Duranleau, Hochelaga-Maisonneuve School Agency. It is also the action of these comrades who has helped to alert the members of the precarious situation of the Castillo family. 
Representatives from all levels of government have mobilized on Sunday, June 5 to support the request made by the members of the Castillo family to the Federal Minister of Immigration to be recognized as refugees and to stay in Quebec. The elected representatives of Hochelaga ask the Minister of Immigration he has in this case a little compassion and allow the family to continue to contribute to the well-being of the Montreal community.
