Quebec- The member for Saint-Jean and the official opposition spokesman for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, deplores the Liberal government method to swallow his reform at the crossroads Youth-Employment (CJE). 
"The Youth-Employment crossroads yesterday received a letter asking them to commit, before December 3, to sign a service agreement, but not to know the details. By doing so, the government is neither more nor less the rifle on the temple of CEP craftsmen. He said to them, "Sign, or we will do business with other external resources", just as the minister mentioned in our last debate on this subject at the National Assembly. The CJEs and their boards are worried and disappointed with this way of doing things, "said Dave Turcotte. 
The member mentions, however, that the government has declined with youth receiving social assistance or employment insurance; At the beginning excluded from the reform of the Minister Fran√ßois Blais, these can now hope for a certain opening. 
"There is no guarantee of maintaining the resources and the CJE mission. It would have been so much easier to ask them to pay particular attention to young people who are furthest from the labor market, while providing support for all of their mission. It is a debate of structures, initiated and prosecuted by the Government, which does not take into account the particularities of the CJE mission, nor the place where they are implanted. We will continue to fight for no young person to be put aside and so that the CJEs will be supported in their work, "said Dave Turcotte.
