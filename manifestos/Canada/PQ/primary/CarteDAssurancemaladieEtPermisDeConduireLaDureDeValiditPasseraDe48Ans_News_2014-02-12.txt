"The benefits of passing the duration of the 8-year health insurance card are multiple, starting with the fact that this measure will make the lives of citizens easier. At the same time, in addition to enabling us to engender savings, halving the number of renewals will contribute to the protection of the environment by reducing the use of paper and plastic, "said Minister Hébert . Currently, the Régie delivers some 2 million cards annually. 
"This new measure is part of our government's desire to improve the provision of services to citizens. By extending the period of validity of the two pieces, we will be able to halve its movements to the points of service. This change aims to better adapt its services to the realities of the population, including saving it time and money, "said Minister Gaudreault.
