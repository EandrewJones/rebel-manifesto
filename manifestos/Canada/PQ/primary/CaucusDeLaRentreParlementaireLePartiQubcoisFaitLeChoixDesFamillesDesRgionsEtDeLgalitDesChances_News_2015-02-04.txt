Québec- On the occasion of a press point held on the margin of the Caucus of the return of the Parliamentary Wing of the Parti Québécois, the member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, indicated the priorities of the Deputy team for the upcoming session: support for families, defense of regions and the willingness to increase equal opportunities. 
"The Liberal government attacks families and regions. The accounting approach of Liberal-Caquist austerity has spares anyone. These two parties put in place destructive austerity. We make the choice to be close to the reality of people, in the field, to see the impact of their decisions, while in Quebec, ministers remain in their offices. The disarray that people in the region currently live is real; I invite members of the government to go see and listen to the population, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
Each region of Quebec will have its member of the Parti Québécois spokesperson 
To relay the regions, the Parti Québécois decided to appoint a spokesperson for each region where he did not elect deputy. This has become necessary because the examples of cups affecting the regions are numerous: 
"The government does not believe in local development or regions. The cuts touch all sectors of activity: economic development, families, youth, housing, and I pass. For the Liberals, the regions no longer exist. They have no vision of occupation of the territory, while the wealth of Quebec is particularly in the diversity of our regions. You have to trust people who are on the ground, "added Stéphane Bédard.
