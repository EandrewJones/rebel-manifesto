Sherbrooke, January 31, 2020 - At the end of the pre-parliamentary wing caucus, in Sherbrooke, Matane-Matapédia, parliamentary leader and spokesperson for the Quebec party in French language, Pascal Bérubé, announced that He will soon drop out a bill that only the positions that really require the knowledge and use of English can be subject to a requirement on the part of employers. 
IN SHORT 
- The Parti Québécois is ready to act without delay to strengthen and promote the French language. 
- Our bill will change the law 101: 
- The employer will have to demonstrate that both the participation in the usual activities of the position and the accomplishment of the task require the knowledge of another language. 
"It is for the least amazing that in Quebec, an employer may require unaulted reason the knowledge of another language than French. We will correct this aberration with the bill that we will register soon; It will come to amend Article 46 of the Charter of the French Language to clarify the context in which an employer may require the knowledge of a language other than French for a job, "said Pascal Bérubé. 
Finished, so, the time when an employer may require the knowledge of English to fill a diver position, as we currently see. "We must now prove that the knowledge of another language is necessary for the accomplishment of the task, and that the working environment requires such a control. In Quebec, the only common and official language is French, and the workers have the right to carry out their activities in French and only in French, "added the spokesman. 
The Parti Québécois proudly assumes its values and principles, and refuses that the decline of the use of French is continuing in the workplace. "While the CAQ stagnates, we are in action. We are determined. With this bill, not only we are strengthening Law 101, but we also bring a working trail to the labor shortage, because the requirement of English unnecessarily accentuates the difficulty, for some people, to Find a job, "concluded Pascal Bérubé.
