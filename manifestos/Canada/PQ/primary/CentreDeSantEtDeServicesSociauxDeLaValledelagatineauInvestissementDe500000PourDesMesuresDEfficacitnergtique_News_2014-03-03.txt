"This budget allowance reiterates the farm of our government to continue the responsible development approach it has undertaken for Quebec. We demand health facilities in Quebec that they deploy, on a daily basis, sustained efforts to provide the people with high quality care and services at the best possible cost. Thanks to these energy efficiency measures, the institution will be able to reduce its energy bill at the same time as its greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in both economic and environmental gains, "said the minister.
