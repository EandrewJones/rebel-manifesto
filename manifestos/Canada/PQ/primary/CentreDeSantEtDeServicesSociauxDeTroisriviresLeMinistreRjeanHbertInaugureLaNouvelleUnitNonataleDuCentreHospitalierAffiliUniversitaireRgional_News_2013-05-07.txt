Trois-Rivières- The Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister Responsible for Elders, Réjean Hébert, once inaugurated the new Neonatal Unit of the Regional Universal Affiliate Hospital Center of the Trois-Rivières Health and Social Services Center, at the end of magnification and redevelopment work of $ 1,284,500. He was accompanied for the occasion of the member for Champlain, Noëlta Champagne. 
"This hospital center has a regional mandate in pediatrics, in perinatology and neonatology. The neonatal unit now benefits from spacious, modern and well-equipped premises. The increase in the number of beds, which goes from 7 to 12, will accommodate a larger number of newborns in need of specialized care, particularly because of a pre-term birth, "said Minister Hébert. 
Recall that the real estate component of this project, which amounts to $ 750,000, has benefited from an investment of $ 262,000 from the establishment, $ 166,000 from the Health and Services Agency Social of Mauricie and Center-du-Québec, as well as a $ 161,000 contribution from the department and equivalent funding from child-child operation. The balance of this project, which amounted to $ 534,500, which is dedicated to the acquisition of specialized medical equipment, was entirely funded by the Department. 
"The Regional Universal Affiliate Hospital Center is called upon to a remarkable growth over the next few years, with the largest benefit of the population of the Mauricie and Center-du-Québec region. I recall that Premier Pauline Marois and the Minister Hébert confirmed the construction of a new four-storey wing, as well as a major redevelopment of some of the current facilities, an ambitious project of the order of 50 Million dollars, "said MP Christmas.
