Quebec - "There will be mandatory statement of deaths in CHSLDs, intermediate resources and private residences for seniors. This is a good thing ". That said the hon. Member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and the official opposition spokesman for seniors, Carole Poirier, happy that the Parti Québécois could have passed this amendment, and several others, to the project of Law 16, An Act to strengthen the certification process for private residences for the elderly of Quebec. 
The law will therefore require the directors of seniors, public or private residences, to inform the Coroner Office of any deaths in obscure circumstances. "When we say that the safety of our elders is paramount and that any form of abuse and neglect to them is unacceptable, we must take every means. This is how we forced the government to go further with Bill 16, "continued Carole Poirier. The mechanics surrounding the form that the form and the administrative process will be known to be known very soon. 
Despite the adoption of some amendments, the hon. Member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve deplores that several important issues, such as inspection and training, are still relegated to work tables. "I really regret that the Liberal government postponed next year the establishment of the team of the 23 inspectors, yet planned in the March Bachand budget last March. It is the same thing with regard to the creation of a work table for the formation and the mandatory ratio of personnel formed by many seniors in private residences. It is a little embarrassing that the government postpone these primordial issues later, "added the spokesperson. 
"A lot of work is still to be done to ensure that our elders live in dignity and the Quebecois party makes it one of its top priorities," concluded Carole Poirier.
