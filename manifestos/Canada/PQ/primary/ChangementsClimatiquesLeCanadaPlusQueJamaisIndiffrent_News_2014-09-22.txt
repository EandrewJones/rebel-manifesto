Quebec- The member for Jonqui√®re and official opposition spokesman in sustainable development and environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, denounces the absence of the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, at the climate summit which takes place these days in New York. 
"Stephen Harper has once again the demonstration that it is completely indifferent to the fight against climate change and that Canada continues to navigate current in this important issue for Quebeckers. Thousands of citizens, however, meant to him yesterday, during the walk for the climate held in about twenty Quebec cities, the importance they give to this struggle, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
According to the member, it demonstrates that Quebec would have an interest in making its own environmental decisions and, above all, to acquire a government that takes responsibility. "The Liberal Minister of the Environment does not apply the environmental laws of Quebec. However, we have the power to become a leader in the fight against climate change. Quebec must be able to decide itself what is happening on its territory. The environment is of the competence of the state of Quebec, "he again recalled. 
"In the TransCanada pipeline file, for example, we have repeatedly asked the minister to stop co-cacouna and immediately hold a BAPE on the entire project. Does Minister Street to listen, or leave the National Canada Office of Canada decide instead of Quebec? "Concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
