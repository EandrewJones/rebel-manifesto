Quebec- The member for Rimouski and official opposition spokesperson for poverty, solidarity and social economy, Harold Lebel, is concerned about the impacts of the government's new compressions in the aid program social. 
"Once again, the Liberal government attacks the most vulnerable people in our society. It is obsessed with the recovery of sums of money, but does not measure at all the impacts that he imposes on, "said Harold Lebel. 
"In all regions, we see that families, community and poorest organizations in our society have difficulty living with the many liberal compressions. The national strategy to combat poverty and social exclusion has expired in 2013; Now, what does this government propose in terms of social solidarity? Nothing, otherwise the liberal-caquist austerity and the cuts, "added the member. 
Yesterday, in the light of the new statistics that indicate that the number of young social beneficiaries increased by 14.4% over the past year, the Parti Québécois asked the Government to act to stimulate economic development and job creation. 
Finally, the hon. Member for Rimouski invites Minister François Blais to listen to those who will comment on his draft regulation. "The minister must do better than his colleagues, who do not listen to the groups or the people at all. It must not only hear them, but also take note of their proposals to find the best ways to help the poorest and families who are struggling to meet the two ends, "he concluded.
