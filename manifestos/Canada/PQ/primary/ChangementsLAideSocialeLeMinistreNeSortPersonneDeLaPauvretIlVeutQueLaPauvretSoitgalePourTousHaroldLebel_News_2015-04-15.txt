Quebec- The member for Rimouski and official opposition spokesman in the fighturing poverty, solidarity and social economy, Harold Lebel, denounces the intention of the Minister of Labor, Employment and the Employment. Social Solidarity, Sam Hamad, to move forward with the amendments announced to the Aid for People and Family Regulations. 
"Once again, the Liberal government proves its lack of sensitivity to the poor and most vulnerable people in our society. He did not listen to the demands of the groups or those of the Protector of the Citizen, nor those of the Commission on Human Rights and the Rights of Youth which, however, have strongly denounced the measures planned, even claiming that they represented an infringement of the rights of persons. In short, the message that the government, today, is imbued with prejudices towards social assistance providers and people in need, "lamented Harold Lebel. 
"With these amendments, the minister does not seek to achieve fairness between providers and low-income workers, nor to release people from poverty; He ensures, rather, that poverty is equal for all. It's amazing, "he added. 
"The planned measures are unacceptable and will make the lives of providers even more difficult. The minister, ignoring the groups that made them proposals, only aggravates problems. After ten years of application, we all need to sit down to take stock of the law aimed at combating poverty and social exclusion, and we ask the true questions: Have we really managed to fight against the poverty? Do we have less prejudices? In light of the amendments that the minister wishes to apply, I doubt it very much, "concluded the hon. Member for Rimouski.
