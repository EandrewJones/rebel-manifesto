Quebec- The member for Vachon and Quebec's Word of the Party on Maritime Strategy, Martine Ouellet, as well as the member for Verchères and spokespersons in Quebec-Canada relations, Stéphane Bergeron, ask the Canadian government to sign quickly. A firm contract with the Davie Shipyard Davie de Lévis for the Resolve project, which consists in converting the MS Asterix into a refueling vessel of the Royal Canadian Navy, can move forward. 
Remember that the eve of the triggering of the Federal Election Campaign, the Stephen Harper government announced the signing of a letter of intent with Site Davie Canada that authorized the start of the work in August. The site hoped for the official conclusion of an agreement before the end of October, but nothing has moved since. 
"What good a maritime strategy if the largest client, Canada, sulks our shipyards and invests our money outside Quebec? What's good if the Liberal government of Quebec is unable to make it sound? While Quebec's Liberals use public money for their advertising campaigns and self-harm, thousands of jobs, contracts and billions of dollars slide between the fingers. The Resolve project represents only $ 300 million ... As Canadian contracts for $ 35 billion were evaluated by the Canadian Auditor General at $ 100 billion! "Insisted Martine Ouellet. 
"Should we remember that over $ 35s that the federal government officially granted contracts in recent years, absolutely nothing has gone to Canada's largest shipyard? To crown the whole, the Conservative government has literally fucked us by letting you hover the vague possibility that Davie gets contracts, solely with the aim of having some more voting polls, but without giving any guarantee. Now, despite these beautiful promises, we are always at the same point. The Federal Liberal government must mitigate the injustice that Quebec is a victim and quickly sign the Resolve project contract, "claimed Stéphane Bergeron.
