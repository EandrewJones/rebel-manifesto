Québec- The member for Vachon and spokespersons of the Parti Québécois in maritime transport and strategy, Martine Ouellet, and the member for Verchères and spokespersons in relation to Québec-Canada, Stéphane Bergeron, deplore the decision of the Government Trudeau delay the award of the contract for the conversion of a door? Containers into a military refueling vessel at Davie site. 
"The Canadian government is still returning the contract for the Resolve project, a contract of nearly $ 700 million for Davie. Meanwhile, the Cuteillard government remains arms crossed and claims to be the champion of the maritime industry. Instead of spending nearly $ 300,000 from Quebec's money to advertise for its maritime strategy, the PLQ government should focus on Davie's record. Another evidence that as long as Quebec is independent, an effective maritime policy for Quebec will not be able to see, "said Martine Ouellet. 
"Governments change, but history is repeated. Ottawa has yet to put Quebec aside in granting the Canadian Navy contracts. Recall that under the Harper government, it's $ 35 billion in the rest of Canada, without a single dollar being attributed to Quebec. As for the Trudeau government, it will soon have made a decision that disadvantage Quebec, "concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
