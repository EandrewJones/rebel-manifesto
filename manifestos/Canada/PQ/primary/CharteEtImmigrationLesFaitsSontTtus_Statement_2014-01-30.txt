Some have recently stated that the Quebec image of Qu√©bec's image and that it leads to lower immigration volumes. These statements were not made impromptu, but on the occasion of public speeches or formal communications. 
An audit of the facts would have allowed these actors to note that on the contrary, the number of immigration applications in Quebec is on the rise: indeed, of the month of August in December 2013, while the debate on the Charter was led, the Ministry of Immigration and Cultural Communities (MICC) received more than 9500 Quebec Certificate Requests (CSQ), while received less than 6,000 during the same period in 2012. And requests from the Maghreb are also rising. 
This is good news! The more requests we receive, the more demanding we can in the allocation of points to the applied grid to select the people who can best integrate the labor market and contribute to the development of Quebec society. 
Quebec was, is and will be a very popular land of immigration. Before launching confident affirmations of the man for seven o'clock, it would be better to document.
