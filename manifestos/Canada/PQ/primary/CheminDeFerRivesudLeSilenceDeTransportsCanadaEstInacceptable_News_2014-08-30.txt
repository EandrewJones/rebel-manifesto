Quebec- The member for Vachon and the official opposition spokesman for transport, transport and maritime strategy, Martine Ouellet, and the member for Verchères and spokespersons in Canadian intergovernmental cases, Stéphane Bergeron, denounce the silence of Transport Canada in the railway file of the South Shore. 
Indeed, last week, the Parti Québécois, citizen associations and the mayors of the region expressed concern about the deplorable state of the river of the South Shore, considering that since July 19, more than 3 million Liters of oil circulate every day on these rails. Following pressure from citizens' associations, Transport Canada conducted inspections and ordered CN to limit the speed of all trains operating on the row of the South Shore. However, we learned this week that the speed limitation order has been raised. 
"I had the opportunity to discuss with the people of Transport Canada. They informed me that they had done inspections on the rails, but they refused to make the inspection reports public public. They also refused to organize information sessions for citizens. Transport Canada must reconsider its position. It is a public body; He must act in all transparency and respect the citizens, "said Martine Ouellet. 
"Citizens have expressed legitimate concerns. Transport Canada has the duty to inform them and reassure them. It should be remembered that the work of the federal agency has been severely criticized by the report of the Transportation Safety Board on the tragedy of Lac-Mégantic. Quebeckers are entitled to expect more exemplary work on its part, "concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
