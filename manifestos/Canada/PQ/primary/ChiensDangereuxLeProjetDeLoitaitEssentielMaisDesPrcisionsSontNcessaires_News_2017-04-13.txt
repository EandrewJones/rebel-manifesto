Quebec, on April 13, 2017- The Quebec Party spokesman for Bill 128, An Act to promote the protection of persons through the establishment of a supervisory of dogs, André Villeneuve, welcomes the fact that The government has finally decided to put an end to the status quo in the dangerous dogs file. However, he clarifies clarification. 
IN SHORT 
"Considering all the unfortunate events involving dangerous dogs that took place in Quebec, we welcome the implementation of clear rules. It is inconceivable that in Quebec, nowadays, dogs can kill or disfigure people. Our duty is to ensure that this never happens again. This bill represents a step in the right direction so that the population can be safe everywhere, "said the member. 
The Parti Québécois is questioned, however, on certain aspects of the bill. "Why does the government want to prohibit by decree, at day 1 of the passage of the bill, only Pitbull dogs? There are other dogs that are also very dangerous, but we do not plan to prohibit them by decree. In addition, the government is expected to unveil the process it intends to put forward to determine whether a dog is Pitbull or not. Is a quarter-mixed dog a pitbull? How does the government intend to determine that, where are the line trace? In particular, André Villeneuve.
