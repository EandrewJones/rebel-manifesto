Quebec- The spokesman for the Parti Québécois in finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, the spokesperson for economy and exports, Alain Therrien, and the spokesperson for employment and Social Economy, Dave Turcotte, deplore the total absence of action of the Liberal government in the face of Quebec's crisis in terms of job creation. Indeed, again last month, the net, Quebec lost 5600 jobs. But we are especially retaining the loss of 24,600 full-time jobs. 
"According to the liberal promise to create 250,000 jobs, there should be 75,000 more jobs in Quebec after a year and a half. The Liberals did not give half, and we owe the meager to create part-time jobs mostly, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
Quebec crosses a job crisis, while the rest of Canada is growing strongly in this area. Since 6 months, Quebec has lost 10,200 jobs, while the rest of Canada created 137,800. "In 19 months of liberal governance, Quebec has been economically surpassing. There was hardly any full-time job, while Canada created 237,300. Only 2.8% of full-time jobs were established in Quebec. Why does the government struggle not to present an economic development plan? Asked Alain Therrien. 
We also find that there is no improvement in the unemployment rate. "While workers are unemployed, the Liberals do not offer structuring measure to stimulate employment in Quebec. Worse, they attack the avenues of improving the living conditions of the workers: popular education centers, junction youth jobs, local employment centers, etc. They are very gloomy prospects that the Liberal government imposes on, "has concluded Dave Turcotte.
