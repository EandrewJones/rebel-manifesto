Quebec, on October 27, 2017 -The official opposition spokesperson for the metropolis as well as in immigration and cultural communities, Carole Poirier, sies of the latest results presented by the Ministry of Immigration, of Diversity and inclusion (noon) regarding the reception of Francophone immigrants. In 5 years, their proportion has dropped drastically from 62% to 42%. Ms. Poirier claims concrete measures to immediately reverse this trend. 
IN SHORT 
"The figures presented yesterday by noon are a failure to fail for the Liberal government. Obviously, a trend as heavy will not be reversed by the minor changes that the department has made to the selection grid of newcomers. Moreover, of his own admission, he does not think he is able to reverse this trend in the short term. What does that mean? What will we fall below 40% next year? And then under 35%? If we rely on the trend for 5 years, without any gesture being done to overthrow it, it is a possibility. Yet the first cause of the decline of French, especially in Montreal, is the failure of the francization of our immigrants, "said Carole Poirier. 
"To overthrow the steam, the Parti Québécois wants to reach the goal of 100% francization. For this, we propose to ensure that every qualified worker selected and his spouse or spouse have an intermediate or advanced knowledge of French. We also want refugees to enjoy a period of francization and paid adaptation. This is how we will ensure the sustainability of our language, "she told.
