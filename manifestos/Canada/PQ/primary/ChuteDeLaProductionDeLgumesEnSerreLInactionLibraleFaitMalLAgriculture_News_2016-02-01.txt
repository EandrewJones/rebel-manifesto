Québec- The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, denounces the immobilism of the Liberal Party before the radical fall of Quebec greenhouse vegetable production. 
"While Ontario is doing agriculture a priority here, the Liberal government remains inactive, even if Quebec loses market share. The Liberal Party for two years has still not presented economic policy or agricultural policy. Greenhouse producers must immediately benefit from firm support. This is not true that we will stay without doing anything while Ontario vegetables take the place of Quebec products on tablets. In addition to preferential electricity rates, several solutions are possible, either cogeneration from wood chips or the conversion of waste into biogas. What does Minister Pierre Paradis wait for action? ", Wonders André Villeneuve. 
It should be remembered that in the framework of the Food Sovereignty Policy, the Quebecois party had decreed that Hydro-Québec had to provide a preferential rate for producers. Unfortunately, the Liberals have abandoned him. "With the policy of food sovereignty, the Parti Québécois had given an impetus to Quebec agriculture by firsting up on the local purchase. The arrival of the Liberals breaks out this momentum. Instead of filing an agricultural policy, Pierre Paradis proposed a discussion. It should realize that our farmers and transformers are in the market and they need actions, not lyrics, "continued the member for Berthier. 
Growth in agricultural income is already lower than Quebec compared to Ontario, and the liberal inaction digs this gap even more. "Where is the plan of the Government of Quebec? Farmers and industry still wait for the Liberals to act. Why did the government put to bin the food sovereignty policy, while it has no plan to replace it? Currently, the line of conduct of Pierre Paradis is partisanship. It should rather focus on helping the agricultural world, "concluded André Villeneuve.
