Quebec- The member for Joliette and sentence of the official opposition in the field of culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, deplores that this morning, Minister Hélène David has exacerbated, rather than apace, the concerns of the culture environment And all the lovers of cinema by not listening to the disappearance of the Cinémathèque Québécoise by its merger with library and national archives of Quebec. Worse, she seems to have wanted, by her answers to the questions of the member for Joliette, confirm this scenario. 
"I join my voice to those of the employees of the Cinémathèque and the artisans of the community, who today launch a real cry of the heart so that the Cinémathèque is saved and that the unacceptable merger scenario, which would have dramatic impacts on the activities. From the Cinémathèque, or abandoned. Thus, we also echo the cry of alarm launched, at the beginning of the month, by producers and directors of great renown. I asked Minister Hélène David to put an end to uncertainty, which she refused to do. On behalf of the austerity and for savings of candlelight, it involves the essential mission of the Cinémathèque: preserve, disseminate and promote our audiovisual and cinematographic heritage, "said Véronique Hivon. 
"The culture community has already been hard hit by the Liberal government. Let's not think about the sad episode of the conservatories, the abandonment of the policy on the book, the compressions in the tax credits for cultural production ... today, definitively excluding the merger of two institutions to very different missions , by clearly taking a position in favor of the Cinémathèque, the minister could have and should have seized the opportunity to demonstrate that she defends it. Our cultural heritage is our history, our identity, our wealth. The government must wake up and show that it understands it and, consequently, dismiss any possibility of merger, "said the member for Joliette.
