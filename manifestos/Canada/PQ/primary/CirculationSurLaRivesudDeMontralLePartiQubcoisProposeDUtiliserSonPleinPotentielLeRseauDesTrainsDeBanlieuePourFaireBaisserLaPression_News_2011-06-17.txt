Montreal -The MP for Vachon, Martine Ouellet, and the hon. Member for La Prairie, François Rebello, stated this morning a plan to maximize the use of the rail network serving the municipalities of southwestern Montreal. 
"The rush hour in Montreal is actually a 24-hour rush hour. In these circumstances, it is unthinkable to leave trains circulating empty and leave them to the garage while citizens are corded on the edge of the bridges, "said François Rebello's entry. 
The plan contains the following measures: 
"All those who travel between Montreal and the South Shore in any sense know very well that access to the city, regardless of the meaning, are regularly hampered. Even on Sunday at noon there is congestion. It is absolutely necessary to remedy this situation, "deplored the hon. Member for La Prairie. 
"It's a fundamental issue in the citizens' everyday life. It is imperative that things change quickly. The measures we propose this morning will lay the groundwork for a real sustainable development in Quebec, "said the member for Vachon, Martine Ouellet. 
For its part, the member for Gouin and the official opposition spokeswoman, Nicolas Girard, said that once again the Liberal government had shown a lack of long-term vision until the situation is uncontrollable before acting. "The measures proposed by my colleagues will certainly serve as guidelines in the strategy that the government must now adopt," concluded Nicolas Girard.
