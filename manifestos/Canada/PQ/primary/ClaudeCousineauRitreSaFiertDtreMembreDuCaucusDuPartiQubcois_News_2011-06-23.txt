Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts -After the article signed by Denis Lessard and entitled "The member for Bertrand Current to rally to Legault", published in the newspaper the press this morning, Claude Cousineau wishes to do the point. 
"I am a proud member of the Parti Québécois caucus and I intend to stay it. I told the extraordinary caucus of yesterday and I did not change their mind about it. There is no question that I joined François Legault's coalition, "said the member for Bertrand. 
"I also recalled that I was thinking about my personal political future to know if I represent myself at the next election. I will think and consult my loved ones during the summer period, "added Claude Cousineau. 
The member also wishes to reassure the activists of his riding. "All kinds of speculation circulate right now. I want to reassure you today. I am at your side to defend and promote the Parti Québécois program that we have adopted together at the last congress. I am a sovereignist and I am still a member of the Quebecois party. Our political training is a great party that is the only vehicle that can lead us to the realization of the sovereignty of Quebec, "concluded Claude Cousineau.
