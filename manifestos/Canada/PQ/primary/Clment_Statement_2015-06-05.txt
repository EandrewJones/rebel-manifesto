The day of the partial elections in Jean-Talon and Chauveau is fast approaching. On June 8, citizens will have the opportunity to choose two excellent candidates. I had the opportunity to campaign with them many times since May 15th. Notably here: http: //go.pq.org/ddvet here: http: //go.pq.org/ddw 
For the riding of Jean-Talon, Clément Laberge is a very busy businessman in his riding. He has been Vice-President of the brand since 2008. This company is specialized in digital publishing; She knew how to carve an enviable place internationally. Clement collaborated, since he holds an experience abroad, who worked in Paris, in particular. 
This father lives in Jean-Talon, he is attached and knows the stakes well. This entrepreneur is exactly the type of candidate we are looking for. I had the pleasure of accompanying it on the ground, among others May 25: http: //go.pq.org/ddxet on May 27th on the street Maguire: http: //go.pq.org/ddy 
You can hear Clement in debate here: http: //go.pq.org/ddz, on the radio-Canada radio waves. 
Among the issues raised by our candidate in Jean-Talon, note the environmental issue for the Port of Quebec Enlargement Project: http: //go.pq.org/d9rassi the historic domain of Sillery: http: // go. pq.org/db8 
The riding of Jean-Talon is held for acquired by the Liberal Party. The Sébastien Proulx Vire-Capot candidate has not offered anything, he made no commitment. Clement Laberge is the best choice for the population. 
I would have the pleasure of doing with him the assessment of his campaign at 13:30 today, on the Samuel-de-Champlain promenade.
