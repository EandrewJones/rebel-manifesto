Shocked by the initiative of two liberal activists who seek donations for the defense of Nathalie Normandeau, the hon. Member for Bonaventure, Sylvain Roy, asks the Prime Minister to immediately dissociate this approach. 
"When we see that children have nothing to eat for lunch, that the food banks are empty, I have misery with a campaign to finance Ms. Normandeau's defense. The former minister is accused of criminal for illegal financing activities. It is now in turn to receive help from the liberal family. It is an indecent approach, and the Prime Minister must immediately tell Quebeckers if he endorses or dissociates the liberal activists who launched it, "said Sylvain Roy. 
The Initiators Fabrice Bourque and André Poirier are two long-standing liberal activists. Mr. Bourque, in addition to having contributed multiple times to the Liberal Party, has already chaired the liberal association of the Gaspé-Îles-de-la-Madeleine. Mr. Poirier, meanwhile, has already attempted to be a Liberal candidate in Bonaventure and gave, according to the registers of the Chief Electoral Officer, several thousand dollars to the Liberal Party Caisse, including a donation of $ 500 to Philippe Couillard during the race race. 
"It is a flagrant lack of ethics to solicit donations for the defense of an ex-minister accused, among other things, conspiracy, corruption, fraud and abuse of confidence. Prime Minister Couillard must condemn without hesitation this fundraiser. Instead of paying the judicial fees of Nathalie Normandeau, I am convinced that Quebeckers prefer to donate to an organization in their region that improves the well-being of people in need, "said the hon. Member for Bonaventure.
