Québec - "The Parti Québécois deed quite insufficient the announcement of the appointment by the Minister Arcand of a new member from the environmental environment on the Committee on the Strategic Environmental Assessment on Shale Gas. With the gas that are always present, the committee is still not credible. Gas can not be judges and parties. We must associate the office of public hearings on the environment at the EAS just as requested by more than 10,000 citizens who have demonstrated on the streets of Montreal last June, "said Scott McKay, Member of Parliament for the Assumption and spokesman for the official opposition in terms of mines, and Martine Ouellet, member for Vachon and spokesperson for the environment, sustainable development, parks and water. 
It will be remembered that citizens present at the demonstration of June 18 had three claims, namely: 
"The announcement yesterday by the minister confirms that the government deliberately dismissed almost all applications. It's totally unacceptable and unfortunately it proves once again that the Liberal government does not hear the grievances of the population, "McKay added. 
"In addition, since there is no moratorium, drilling activities are continuing and some well-drilled wells still pose significant problems with gas leaks. For their part, the gas continues their drill plans as if nothing had happened. There are risks of contamination of water and air pollution, "added Martine Ouellet. 
"Minister Arcand lacks a great opportunity to restore the relationship of trust with the population. When will the Liberal government finally stop defending the private interests of the gas? "Concluded Scott McKay.
