The ex-entrepreneur has ever gave birth to anyone to the Quebecois party between 1998 and 2011. 
During the period from 1998 to 2003, Lino Zambito made a single donation from $ 600 to the Parti Québécois, in 2001. He never used a possession to finance the Parti Québécois. 
Between 1998 and 2003, Lino Zambito obtained from the Ministry of Transport from Quebec contracts totaling about $ 30 million. He confirmed to the Charbonneau commission that there was no connection between the gift he made to the Parti Québécois in 2001 and the contracts obtained. 
Mr. Zambito also told the Commission that there was no fake extras or extras swelling during the period from 1998 to 2003, while the Parti Québécois was in power.
