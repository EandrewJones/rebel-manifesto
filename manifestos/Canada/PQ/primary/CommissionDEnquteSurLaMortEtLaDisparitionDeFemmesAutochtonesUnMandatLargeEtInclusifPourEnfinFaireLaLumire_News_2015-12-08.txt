Quebec- The Quebec Party spokesperson for Women's Status, Carole Poirier, and the Aboriginal Affairs Spokesperson, Guy Leclair, request that the mandate of the new commission of inquiry into missing Aboriginal women or murdered is broad and covers all crimes committed. They also want Aboriginal people to be an integral part of the process and decision-making concerning them. 
"It is fundamental that Aboriginal women are consulted, that they participate in the commission of inquiry, and that their role is truly decision-making. The sexism, still present and tolerated in our society, is accentuated by the many sources of violence to which Aboriginal women have faced for decades. The death and disappearance of nearly 1200 of them, or the sexual assaults that many have denounced in Val-d'Or, testify to the sexist and discriminatory excesses that are victims of aboriginal women, "said Carole Poirier. 
By adopting Laloi on Indians, Canada has not only established a colonial system meaning paternalism, loss of autonomy and dependence on Aboriginal people, but has also strengthened a gender-based model, whose basis is the lack of consent for women . Recall also that between 1980 and 2012, the RCMP identified 1181 cases concerning Aboriginal women - 1017 were killed and 164 are disappeared -, which exceeds the previous estimates, which were rather around 600. 
Guy Leclair reiterated the importance of holding a truly independent investigation into Val-d'Or events. "Although the announcement of a federal commission of inquiry is good news for Aboriginal women in Quebec, it is deplorable that the Government of Philippe Couillard attempts to scroll through its responsibilities. By refusing to make an independent public inquiry into the Events of Val-d'Or, it closes our eyes on a real problem that happens in our streets and in our villages, "he insisted.
