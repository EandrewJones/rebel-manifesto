Quebec- The member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesman for the official opposition on the matter of women, Carole Poirier, welcomes the support received by the motion that she filed on Tuesday, at the National Assembly, proposing The establishment of a special parliamentary committee on sexual violence against women. 
"National women clusters have declared themselves this morning in favor of the proposal I submitted Tuesday. I am pleased to see that there is a desire shared by civil society to hold a deep reflection on the causes and consequences of sexual violence, as well as the adequate ways of preventing it. Violence against women is unacceptable. We must collectively - because it is a corporate issue - look into the issue, evaluate the effectiveness of current tools, and determine those to put in place to remedy it. 
The member wanted to remember that this necessary discussion must be held quickly. She also met with the minister responsible for the status of women and the member for Gouin, last night, to examine the terms and conditions that this commission could be put in place. 
"The recent wave of denunciations of sexual assault in the media and on social networks calls us all. I hope that the societal discussion that can be hoped with a special parliamentary committee is open open, and that it allows everyone to speak. It is important that men are also included in the process. Finally, this commission must allow us to better identify the forms of violence and harassment of a sexual nature, so that we can adequately counter them, "concluded Carole Poirier.
