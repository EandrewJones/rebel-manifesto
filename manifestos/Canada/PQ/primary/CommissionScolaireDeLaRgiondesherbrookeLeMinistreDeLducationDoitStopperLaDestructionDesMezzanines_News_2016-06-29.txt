Quebec- The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesman for the Parti Party in terms of school education and perseverance, Alexander Cloutier, asks the government to reverse and stop the destruction of mezzanines in the schools of the region from Sherbrooke. 
For 10 years now, mezzanines have been installed in classes specially designed by teachers who wish to promote student success and make the classes more interactive. These facilities are now threatened with destruction since they do not respect the standards of the building board. "The government opts here for the easy solution," said Alexander Cloutier. 
"Here we have a very nice example of an initiative of teachers who innovate to support the success of our young people. They thought about these places and designed them specifically for their class to be more user-friendly and that reading becomes playful in the eyes of students, which is not easy in 2016. Instead of mechanically applying its rules, the government Must ensure adapting them, in collaboration with the schools, in order to allow the initiative to continue while ensuring the safety of the students, "added the member for Lac-Saint-Jean. 
Once again, parents and teachers are obliged to mobilize to defend achievements that promote the success of their children. "The minister responsible for the region, Luc Fortin," said he wanted to save the mezzanines. Three months later, he ranks behind the government's arguments and dropped these teachers and parents. It is midnight less one. We ask the Minister of Education, SÃ©bastien Proulx, to intervene quickly before the destruction of the mezzanines is completed, "concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
