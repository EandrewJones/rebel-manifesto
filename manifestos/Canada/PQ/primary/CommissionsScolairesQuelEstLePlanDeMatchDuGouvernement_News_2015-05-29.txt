Quebec- The member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and sentence of the official opposition in terms of primary and secondary education, Nicole Léger, reacted to the announcement made this morning, as part of the Congress of the Federation of the Federation School Boards of Quebec, by the Minister of Education, François Blais, concerning the abolition of school elections. 
"The status quo was no longer acceptable; The Parti Québécois has said several times. This announcement of the minister is not a surprise. However, we will remain vigilant to ensure that parents remain strongly represented in the new structure and for the regions to retain their powers, "said Nicole Léger. 
Indeed, the Parti Québécois wishes that decision-making remains close to families, parents, students. Now, for a year, the government has said a lot about it, but it has not presented anything concrete. "I have been asking for this government to stop improvising behind closed doors and working seamlessly with the education community. When will it file a concrete plan and will he lead a public consultation? We do not know what direction does the minister go, as he has to answer several questions. What does he intend to do for the English-speaking community? How will the perception of school taxes be articulated? What will be the place reserved for parents? , Asked the spokesman. 
Nicole Léger also pointed out that the announced changes should not overshadow the fact that the government is savagely cutting into education since its arrival, among others in assistance to homework, food aid, the purchase of books and specialized services for children in difficulty. "Of course, all these compressions threaten the success of young people; Unfortunately, the Liberals are too busy with the structures to think about it, "she concluded.
