Quebec- The member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, as well as the hon. Member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesperson for international relations, Carole Poirier, emphasized the International Day dedicated to the Memory of Victims Holocaust. 
"On January 27, 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of the liberation, by the Allied forces, the concentration and extermination camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau, Poland. Out of respect for hundreds of thousands of women, men and children who have been detained or died there, we have an important duty of memory. While the number of survivors decreases from year to year, it is up to the rising generations to perpetuate the memory of these tragic events and to continue to defend the dignity of each human being. Such an abomination should never reproduce, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
"Several decades after the facts, we hope that we are now able to learn from this dark and shameful page of human history. In particular, let us remember that racism, intolerance, prejudice or hatred have led to any progress. We must continue fighting them, in all their forms, "added Carole Poirier.
