Quebec- The member for Joliette and sentence of the official opposition in higher education, Véronique Hivon, finds that the Minister of Higher Education, Yves Bolduc, not happy to have already imposed record cuts for 2014 -2015, adds a layer today by further sabling, both the college network and the academic network. 
"Does the Minister of Higher Education really believe that the cuts, which are doubled in CEGEPs, will have no effect on the quality of education and the support offered to young people? Is it really convinced that the new cuts in the universities, which now reach almost $ 200 million, do not affect teaching or research? It's impossible! The minister knows perfectly that he tackles directly to the quality of education, "said Véronique Hivon. 
"Universities and CEGEPs are sources of knowledge and engines for innovation in Quebec. Cut directly into the network, cut into teaching, knowledge, knowledge, research is to pull yourself in the foot for the future because these are areas we should give absolute priority, for both our social development and for our economic growth, "added the member. 
The politics of cynicism 
"The liberal opposition denounced on all forums the financial situation of the universities. A few months later, the same people radically change their position and impose record compressions on the network. We now understand that the Grand Cree of the Liberal Party members were only an electoralist strategy. After that, one wonders why Quebec voters are cynical, "concluded the member of the Quebecois Party.
