"For months, the Liberal Minister has been acting as if he was not the principal head of the cuts in the services that hit all the students in Quebec. He is unable to assume his responsibilities.

Recall that Minister Yves Bolduc requires cuts of $ 90 million in school success, $ 10 million in school adaptation for the most vulnerable students, and $ 30 million in so-called "additional" allocations. , only for the year 2014-2015. "The Minister of Education Cups $ 130 million in direct help to students in difficulty and it imagines that it will not have concrete effects on the ground! He is totally disconnected, "added the member of the Parti Québécois. 
Bolduc, a student in failure 
"Minister Yves Bolduc has a whole round of the head; He dares to give lessons on public finances, while he did not hesitate to take advantage of a fault in a compensation program he himself created to put $ 215,000 in the pockets. Prime Minister Philippe Couillard must understand that his minister of education is a student in a failure situation. He has the duty to replace him, "concluded Nicole Léger.
