Still "bolduc cups" 
The Minister of Higher Education, Yves Bolduc, can not just ask universities to slash massively and then wash their hands. "The leaders of these cups that will affect universities are Minister Bolduc and his government. No question they dissociate it ", continued Véronique Hivon. 
Commitments on tuition rights in danger? 
Given mass cuts in CEGEPs and universities, the Liberal government must confirm its commitments not to raise tuition fees in universities beyond indexation and not to change the bills of Cégépians. "Faced with a minister of higher education who does not seem to have a vision for education and a government that has never hesitated to question the accessibility to education, students must be reassured," has concluded the spokesperson.
