Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu- The member for Joliette and sentence of the official opposition on higher education, Véronique Hivon, denounces the record cuts of $ 200 million in Quebec universities; In light of the information revealed in recent days, we can indeed note that they directly affect the quality and competitiveness of the Quebec university network. 
"For several months, the Minister of Higher Education, Yves Bolduc, tried to make believe that massive cuts in universities would not have concrete effects on the ground. It was known that it did not hold the road, and we now have the proof: among other consequences, hundreds of courses are canceled, faculties are merged or outright abolished, positions are cut and teachers could see their salary decrease. By acting as it does, the government deliberately tackles the quality of teaching and research, and it washes its hands with devastating impacts that flow from its decisions. On behalf of transparency, the minister must testify now the details of all the services that will be affected by the cuts in our universities, "claimed Véronique Hivon. 
"From the moment when the quality of education is reached, it is all the competitiveness of the Quebec network, which will be allocated to the rest of the world. As if it was not enough that Philippe Couillard does not have a plan or vision to revive the economy and employment in Quebec, now it cuts, without any state of mind, in teaching, Knowledge and knowledge, either in what constitutes the greatest wealth of a society: its gray matter ", continued the member for Joliette. 
"As they were in the opposition, less than a year ago, the Liberal Party members were tearing their shirt to denounce the underfunding of universities. A few months later, they agree that their government orders massive cuts in the network, without worrying a second of the consequences. It is a sad example of political cynicism and recording, "Véronique Hivon concluded.
