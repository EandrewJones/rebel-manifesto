Quebec- The Government of Quebec is sensitive to concerns expressed by many citizens and municipalities regarding the installation of new generation meters. To this end, he adopted a decree in which he reports concern about the pricing relating to the withdrawal option. 
"The adoption of this decree is part of a government approach inviting Hydro-Québec to propose other technological or administrative solutions to its customers who do not want new generation counters. We hope that the management of energy is sensitive to the concerns expressed by many citizens and municipalities, "said Minister of Natural Resources, Ms. Martine Ouellet. 
By this decree, the Government also invites the Energy Régie to take into consideration the recommendations expressed by the National Assembly in a unanimous motion adopted on May 29. This unanimous motion reflects the will of the members of the National Assembly to see Hydro-Québec evaluate options that do not penalize its customers who refuse intelligent meters and allow to offer another type of counter-free counter (fees are currently $ 137 at installation and $ 206 annually). 
Let us mention that the Régie has requested Hydro-Québec, in a judgment on December 2, to file its application for amendment relating to the fees related to the withdrawal option as soon as possible.
