Quebec, August 17, 2016 -The Member of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesman for the Parti-Condition of Status of Women, Carole Poirier, insists that the Government does not take for the pretext the federal investigation to abandon the mandate of Initiative on the living conditions of Aboriginal women, particularly in terms of spousal and sexual violence. Instead, she claims, on the part of the government, fast and concrete actions that are finally taking into account multiple investigative reports. 
"In the wake of the testimonies collected by the issue investigating the fate of Aboriginal women last October, several elected officials of the Quebecois party moved to Val d'Or to meet with stakeholders in the region. We were then able to see the fragility of the environment and the need to investigate the troubling events that affected communities. Since then, we have been asking the government to shed light on what is happening in Val d'Or, confiding a mandate to the Independent Investigations Office, "said Carole Poirier. 
"Yet, in response to the Events of Val-d'Or, the government has just made some lightning visits and announcing minor and inadequate measures, probably hoping to put the lid on the pot. He even had the front of appointing an observer without consulting the Aboriginal leaders beforehand. Finally, although the government has committed to entrusting Val-d'Or investigation to the Independent Investigations Office last April, nothing has moved since. It is unacceptable, "concluded the spokesperson.
