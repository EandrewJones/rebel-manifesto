Québec- The Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, will visit Winnipeg, on September 25, to meet his counterparts from the federal, provincial and territorial governments, at the Federal-Provincial-Territorial Conference of Ministers responsible for transport and road safety. At the request of the Government of Quebec, the issues related to railway safety will be on the agenda of this meeting. 
"The security of our modern transportation services, both for people and goods, is paramount. The tragic railway accident occurred on July 6 in the Municipality of Lac-Mégantic came to place this issue among our most pressing concerns. This tragedy illustrates how imperative it is to maintain rigorous safety measures, "said Minister Gaudreault. 
"I intend to take advantage of this meeting to expose the vision of Quebec in the field of transport and safety, with respect for the skills of everyone," concluded Mr. Gaudreault.
