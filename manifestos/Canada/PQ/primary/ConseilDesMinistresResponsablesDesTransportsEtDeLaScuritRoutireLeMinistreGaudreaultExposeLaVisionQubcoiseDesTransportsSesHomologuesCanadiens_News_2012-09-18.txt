Quebec- The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the Territory and MP for Jonqui√®re, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, took advantage of his participation in the meeting of the Council of Ministers responsible for transport and security road, Fredericton, New Brunswick, to expose the Quebec Vision of Transport. 
The minister emphasized that for Quebec, a vision of transportation development involves a significant decline in greenhouse gas emissions, associated with a decrease in energy consumption. To achieve this, collective transport, which will need to be considered in an integrated policy, will be at the heart of the Quebec Vision of Transport. This sector will be one of the spearheads that will lead Quebec to its energy independence. The Quebec government has the firm intention to engage in this direction. 
"This meeting was also an opportunity to recall that Quebec is responsible for its transport skills. I argued that, as part of the renewal of its investment programs in infrastructure, the federal government's approach will need to be based on foreseeable funding. By knowing the resources available in the long term, we will be able to make better planning. In addition, Quebec will ensure that it is due to it in federal funds that will be made available in the coming years, "said Minister Gaudreault. 
Remember that the Council of Ministers responsible for Transport and Road Safety in Canada generally meets once a year to deal with interest files for all governments. The previous meeting of this council went back to September 2010 in Halifax.
