Quebec- The member for Matane-Matapédia and official opposition on public safety, Pascal Bérubé, as well as the members of the Quebecois Party of Longueuil, Martine Ouellet (Vachon), Diane Lamarre (Taillon) and Bernard Drainville (Marie-Victorin), ask the government to clearly denounce the intimidation that undergoes the Mayor of Longueuil, Caroline St-Hilaire. 
Last week, Mrs. St-Hilaire denounced the excesses of the Leader of the Opposition, Robert Myles, who says Longueuil is a bilingual city. She also asked the Government to strengthen Law 101 to clarify the rules in this area. However, following a series of threats in his place, the police decided to ensure the safety of Ms. St-Hilaire. 
A few days ago, asked about it, the Minister of Transport, Robert Poëti, said, "If she, if she has a problem, will have to rule it! It's not my responsibility to me (sic) ... " 
"For several days, the security has been strengthened around the Mayor of Longueuil. However, the government has not clearly denounced the threats and intimidation of which is Victim Caroline St-Hilaire; Instead, he sent contradictory messages. Where are the ministers of municipal affairs, public safety and the minister responsible for fighting bullying? They must send a clear message and fake against Robert Poëti's comments, "said Pascal Bérubé. 
"Law 101 provides for municipalities to communicate with their citizens and provide services in English when more than 50% of their population declares himself English speaking; This is a measure that no one calls into question. In Longueuil, the vast majority of citizens identify French as the first language. It is not normal that an elected, wherever it is in Quebec, undergo intimidation, or threats, because it recalls that French is the common language of public use in Quebec, "have Added Martine Ouellet, Diane Lamarre and Bernard Drainville.
