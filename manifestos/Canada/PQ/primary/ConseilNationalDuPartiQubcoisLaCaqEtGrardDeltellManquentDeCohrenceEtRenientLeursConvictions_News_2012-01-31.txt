Montreal-As a result of the National Council of the Parti Québécois, the spokesman for François Legault in the National Assembly, Gérard Deltell, went from statements for the least surprising by vigorously denouncing the proposals adopted by citizen citizens. 
"By accusing the Quebecist party to be disconnected, Mr. Deltell is ignoring the positions he has already defended himself. Before making such statements that do not exude the political debate, Gérard Deltell should have remembered that in August 2011, by communicating, he accused the Quebecois party for stolen the ideas of the ADQ. What a lack of coherence! , "Said the President of the National Executive Board, Raymond Archambault. 
"Gérard Deltell should also remember that in 2000, the former head of the ADQ, Mario Dumont, had filed a bill at the National Assembly on popular initiative referendums. About Transfumes, MM. Legault and Deltell should take note of the position defended by the member for the Peltrie now member of the CAQ. In February 2011, Eric Cairo was submitting a bill at the National Assembly regarding the dismissal of deputies, "added Raymond Archambault. 
"We knew that new Caquist MPs were Vire-Capot, today we have more evidence. How can they denounce the proposals adopted by the Parti Québécois while they demanded paternity a few months ago? Recommended Raymond Archambault, recalling that the Quebecois Party is the largest political training in Quebec with its 90,000 members.
