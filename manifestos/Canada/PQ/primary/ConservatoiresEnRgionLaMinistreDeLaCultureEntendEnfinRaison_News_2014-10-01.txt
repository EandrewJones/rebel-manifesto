Quebec- The member for Joliette and sentence of the official opposition in the field of culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, and the hon. Member for Rimouski, Harold Lebel, welcome the decline of the Minister of Culture and Communications, Hélène David, as to the closure of the conservatories in the region. However, they will remain vigilant. 
"We are obviously pleased to see that as a result of the grievance of this anticipated closure in the environment and the very vigorous mobilization of the population, the minister finally heard reason. It declines on the closure of the conservatories in the region. This decision is beneficial; It was necessary in order to safeguard the rise of talent, musical expression and arts across Quebec, "said Véronique Hivon. 
Harold Lebel has stressed the great mobilization of the entire Rimousk community against the closure of its conservatory. 
"It's certain that all this mobilization has made the common sense to Hélène David. Now the minister has promised that she would go to the region to meet people. I ask him for transparency; She must meet everyone and do not do it in a stash. It is very important for the minister to listen to citizens and partners who have mobilized, "added the hon. Member for Rimouski. 
"One wonders why the minister did not clutch the door two weeks ago, when the first rumors started to circulate. I would also like to thank all the people who mobilized; The minister must now remember that what to do is consult and listen to the people on the ground, who know better than anyone how the conservatories are flagship institutions for the regions and for their cultural dynamism He concluded Véronique Hivon.
