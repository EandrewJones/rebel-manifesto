Montreal, Saturday, August 17, 2019 - In the context of the recovery approach of the Parti Québécois, the CNJPQ has organized today in Montreal a consultation with its young members. More than 90 people went there to participate in the discussions and make their opinion heard. Pascal Bérubé, parliamentary leader of the Parti Québécois and MP, Véronique Hivon, member for Joliette and Sylvain Gaudreault, Member of Parliament for Jonquière, were also present. 
Among the results of the consultation, there is 67% support for a frequent consultation of members and sympathizers to guide parliamentary action, 62% for sending representatives to the Congresses of other independence parties, and 84% In order to force the chief, the parliamentary wing, the national executive and the political commission to consult the youth wing for youth issues. These results will directly influence the main proposal that will be unveiled in the coming weeks for the Extraordinary National Congress of 9 and 10 November. 
"Here I see conviction, passion, hope. This hope we will help you wear it. The Parti Québécois, this great independence movement, is able to transform thanks to you. In the coming months and the next few years, the most stimulating place to militate, it will be the Parti Québécois and CNJPQ! Camé Pascal Bérubé, parliamentary leader of the Parti Québécois. 
"Bravo to all young people for these beautiful discussions, these beautiful exchanges. I am proud to see you as many ready to go up your sleeves to work towards the revival of the country's party and project. We can not wait to wear your ideas and requests to the National Executive and the Extraordinary National Congress of November to build a Quebecois party that looks like you!
