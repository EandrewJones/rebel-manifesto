Quebec- The member for Vachon and spokesperson for the official transport, maritime strategy and electrification of transport, Martine Ouellet, is pleased to see the different innovative ideas on the table to modernize the industry. Taxi, but notes that the Minister of Transport, Robert Poëti, still refuses to crack down against the UberX illegal taxi. The hon. Member today participated in the consultation on the taxi transport industry organized by the Ministry of Transport. 
"The improvement of the taxi service is already underway, several beautiful initiatives such as the development of mobile applications, GPS systems, fast payment methods, electric vehicles, and many others are on the table today. . Like any industry, that of the taxi must modernize, but an improvement in the service alone can not make the weight against a competitor who does not respect any rule and who does not pay a TVQ, no TPS, no tax and No permits. The minister only repeats that he opposes UberX, but does not put any concrete gestures to stop him once and for all. It must intervene before the situation degenerates, as is currently the case in France, "said Martine Ouellet. 
All taxi industry stakeholders were gathered today at the Montreal Congress Palace to discuss the future of the sector. Several topics were on the agenda, such as payment methods, pricing, training of drivers, passenger safety, among others. Unfortunately, the means to counter the UberX illegal taxi were not on the program. 
"Despite the numerous demands of the industry, Minister Poëti refused the exchanges concerning the means to counter illegal taxi companies. Obviously, seizures are ineffective to stop the illegal taxi because it continues to grow since its arrival in Quebec. Industry people have ideas, they wanted to express themselves on the subject. It is unfortunate that the minister refused to hear them, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
