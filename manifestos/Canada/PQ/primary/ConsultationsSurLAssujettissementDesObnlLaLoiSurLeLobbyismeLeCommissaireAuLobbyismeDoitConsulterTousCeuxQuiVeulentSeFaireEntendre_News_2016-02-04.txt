Quebec- In response to the announced willingness of the lobbyism commissioner to invite only twenty groups to his consultations on the subjection of non-profit organizations (NPOs) to the Lobbying Act, the Leader of the Official opposition and spokesman for the Quebecois party responsible for the reform of democratic institutions, Bernard Drainville, asks him to consult all those who want to be heard. 
For the time being, only 22 NPO groups have been summoned, while more than 60,000 NPOs will be affected by Bill 56. Among the organizations who want to be heard, there are community organizations with little. financial and human resources that take care of fragile clienteles across Quebec. The Commissioner must hear them. 
In addition, the decision to hold private consultations in Montreal and Quebec City also poses a problem, since the community organizations and the target NPOs are found throughout the territory of Quebec. The auditors of the Commissioner must therefore be held in the region, not only in Quebec and Montreal. 
"One of the fundamental principles of the Lobbyism Act is transparency. And what does the commissioner do? He holds auditions that will not be public. It's a nonsense. His consultations should be public, leaves the webcast, "said Bernard Drainville. 
Current consultations follow a request from the former minister responsible for the reform of democratic institutions, Jean-Marc Fournier, who wanted the Commissioner to the lobbyism exchange with the NPOs to analyze the usefulness and relevance of their Subject to the Lobbyism Act, as proposed by Bill 56. The Minister Fournier mandated the Commissioner for the production of a report on different ways of solution to this issue. "But, by this decision, the Commissioner goes against Jean-Marc Fournier's will, who wanted a complete portrait of the situation for consultations on Bill 56," concluded Bernard Drainville.
