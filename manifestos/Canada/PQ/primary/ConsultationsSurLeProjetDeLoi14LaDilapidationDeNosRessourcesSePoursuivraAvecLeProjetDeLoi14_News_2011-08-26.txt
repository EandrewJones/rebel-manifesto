Quebec - Following the special consultations held this week on Bill 14 on Mines, the member for Vachon and sentence of the official opposition in terms of Mines, Martine Ouellet, arrives at an obvious conclusion: the Bill on mines does not solve the dilapidation of our natural wealth. 
The important issue of royalties is still absent from Bill 14, just as she was in the deceased bill 79. One year and two consultations later, we are at the same point. "The Liberal government has not listened to the population. Despite the affirmation of Prime Minister Jean Charest last May to the effect that he was willing to discuss the issue of royalties in Bill 14, Minister Simard has so far closed the door, "said Martine Ouellet. 
"The majority of the groups came to tell us that royalties were not sufficient. Quebec and regions need to benefit from the exploitation of our natural riches. Unfortunately, the Charest government makes economic development worthy of the period of colonialism. He brings us back at the time of Duplessis and even worse! At least at this time the mining builds their infrastructures at their expense, now with the North Plan, it is the whole population that will pay, "said Martine Ouellet. 
"The Charest government, by the voice of his minister delegated to natural resources and wildlife, will have to redo his duties and proceed to a complete redesign of his bill to integrate the important issue of royalties so that the Parti Québécois L 'Support. Natural wealth belong to all Quebeckers and we must absolutely regain control right now, "said the member for Vachon. 
"Other issues such as transparency, the independence of consultations, the expropriation, the exclusion of urban areas and resorts to exploration and the level of fines were also discussed during this consultation. The bill is not up to it and it is clear that major amendments are needed to ensure better environmental protection and respect for local communities, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
