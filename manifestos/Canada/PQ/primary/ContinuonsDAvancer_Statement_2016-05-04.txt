Our movement takes its sources in the ideal of this project, but also in the history of our avant-garde policies. These values ​​that are ours, such as freedom, pride, success, solidarity and equality of opportunity, they continue to inspire our willingness to improve the lives of Quebeckers.The last national council of the party Quebeckers, we have a clear and ambitious plan for our political training to hold the tools it needs during the next election campaign. The elements of this plan are always relevant today and we will continue to make progress.
