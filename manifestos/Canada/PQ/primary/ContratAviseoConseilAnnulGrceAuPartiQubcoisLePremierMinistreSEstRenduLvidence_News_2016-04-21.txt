Québec- The member for Sanguinet and spokesman for the Parti Québécois in terms of energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, notifies with satisfaction that the Liberal Prime Minister Philippe Couillard has finally canceled the contract that his government had signed with the Aviseo firm Advice. 
"The Prime Minister visited. We did not want a complacent or exaggerated report on the benefits of the possible energy project. The government wanted to give the contract to people with personal ties with the Office of the Minister of Finance, the same who had roughly overestimated the benefits of the North Plan to brown the pill. It is a new decline of the Liberal government, and we can sorry because it took 48 hours. It became a habit with the Prime Minister: we unveil a situation and expect two days before reacting. It's a 48-hour government! "Said Alain Therrien. 
Remember that in February 2012, Jean-Pierre Lessard, the second shareholder of Aviseo Council, and his former colleague Guillaume Caudron, the current director of the Minister of Finance, have co-signed and published in the pages of several newspapers an assessment Outrageously complacent from the North Plan. The text is falling from 148 billion. 
"Today, the government cancels the contract, while it was actually preparing to pass a pipeline! Quebeckers are not fooled, we had already played in this movie with the North Plan. Thanks to our interventions, we can have the portrait of the analyzes that can be done by the Ministry of Finance, "concluded Alain Therien.
