Quebec - "By granting this contract to Landis + Gyr, Hydro-Québec is missing with its Quebec economic development mission. This company intends to create only 75 jobs and assemble smart meters in Mexico. However, other Quebec consortia had put on the ranks to win this contract to develop here in Quebec technology and create a lot more jobs. " 
This is what the member for Jonquiere and spokesman of the official opposition in terms of energy, Sylvain Gaudreault, learning that Hydro-Québec employees want to force the Crown corporation to Explain before the Energy Board on the contract granted to the Swiss supplier Landis + Gyr for intelligent meters, a contract of $ 350 million. 
He criticizes the Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, to make the spokesperson for Hydro-Québec and not to play his role as minister. "By radoiding the same explanations as Hydro-Québec and Thierry Vandal, Minister Normandeau is accompliced by a Crown corporation that ranks second the role it must play in economic and technological development," has Prosecuted Mr. Gaudreault. 
Thus, the Parti Québécois may request that Hydro-Québec come to explain itself in parliamentary committee. "Because Minister Normandeau is unable to understand the issues and that it constantly repeats us that the Crown corporation is also attributable to parliamentarians, so it is necessary to assume that the Liberal government could say yes to a convocation in parliamentary committee. . That's why we seriously consider this possibility, said the member for Jonquière. Let's not forget that this decision affects 800 families from across Quebec; Hydro-Québec must come to explain its long-term vision because at the moment, it sounds like subcontracting and privatization in soft, "he added. 
"It's not too late for Hydro-Québec's customers to get better than Landis + Gyr offers Quebec with this contract in its current form," concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
