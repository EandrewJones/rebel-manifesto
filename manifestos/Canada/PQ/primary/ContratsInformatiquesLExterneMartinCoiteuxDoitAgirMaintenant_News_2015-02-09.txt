Quebec- The hon. Member for Bonaventure and the official opposition for information on informational resources, Sylvain Roy, asks the President of the Treasury Board, Martin Coiteous, to act concretely and quickly in the file of the Computer Contracts given to the external, whose cost will reach $ 1 billion this year. 
"An article published this morning demonstrates the loss of total control of the Liberals on IT in Quebec. Since they have resumed power, practices between 2003 and 2012 are back with respect to computer consultants. In this period of liberal austerity, while the government cuts everywhere and that families pay the price, where logic when one gives 1 billion contracts outside? We know that Martin Coiteux has abandoned all the initiatives of the Government of the Parti Québécois on this issue, especially with regard to the centers of expertise and free software. But, for the future, we still do not know what he will do. But from what we know of the situation, we must act now, "said Sylvain Roy. 
We pay the price of loss of expertise 
The member also recalled that the compressions and layoffs made by the Liberal governments in the public service for 10 years have made the state has lost its expertise and must now pay the big price for external resources. To overcome this deficit, the government of the Parti Québécois had planned to create two computing centers in Rimouski and Chicoutimi. He had also planned the implementation of a center of expertise for free software. Unfortunately, all these initiatives have been hampered by the Liberal government. 
"The loss of expertise in our public service is harmful on several plans. In computer science, it translates into astronomical costs for taxpayers. We had done gestures to actually attack us the problem, but the Liberal government has stopped everything. He must wake up and pursue the projects our government had put in place, "concluded Sylvain Roy.
