Following the Claims of the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec (DGEQ) of March 10 and April 20, the Parti Québécois announces two payments representing all the amounts claimed. Also, political training confirms having placed $ 150,000 in trust for the duration of the challenge of claims of December 2016. 
The first payment, made on April 10, 2017, corresponds to $ 69,200, the total amount of the notice received on March 10, 2017. The second installment, carried out on April 20, 2017, corresponds to $ 60,950, also equivalent to the amount of the notice received on the same date. 
These payments follow the administrative processes of verifying the compliance of contributions involving the Parti Québécois team as well as the DGEQ. It is important to remember that since December 2016, the Parti Québécois has made four installments totaling $ 220,845. 
Claims in litigation, dating from December 2016, remain awaiting a decision of the Superior Court. As previously announced, the Parti Québécois fulfills its commitment to place $ 150,000 in trust in anticipation of a decision that may require additional payments. No date for the suites at this dispute has been set to date. 
The Parti Québécois reiterates its commitment to reimburse all fully identified non-compliant contributions as such by the DGEQ.
