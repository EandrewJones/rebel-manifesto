Quebec- The member for Verchères and the official opposition on the municipal affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, was surprised that François Legault's CAQ stands behind Minister Laurent Lessard to protect the Mayor of Mascouche and former candidate of the Liberal Party of Quebec, Richard Marcotte, despite the serious accusations of abuse of confidence, corruption, fraud and conspiracy for fraud that weigh against him. 
"The principle of precaution in law does not go against the presumption of innocence. We do not want to force it to resign, even if it would be wise on its part to do it by itself. We ask the government to intervene so that the Mayor withdraws from the Municipal Council, at least temporarily, "said Stéphane Bergeron. 
The member emphasizes that it is possible to act. Indeed, the Attorney General may bring an action in the illustration of the mayor of Mascouche. The government could also subject the city of Mascouche to the control of the Municipal Commission of Quebec. 
"A sound management of a municipal administration requires a minimum of confidence in the elected officials. However, in the present case, the municipal councilors are unanimous and ask for the departure of Mayor Marcotte, "the hon. Member for Verchères. 
"It is not surprising that the Liberal government protects a former Liberal candidate. After all, he is part of the family. What surprises is the support of François Legault and the CAQ to protect the mayor of Mascouche. That the Liberal government does not have ethics, we knew it; What we learn today is that the CAQ neither does it either. It's troubling, "concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
