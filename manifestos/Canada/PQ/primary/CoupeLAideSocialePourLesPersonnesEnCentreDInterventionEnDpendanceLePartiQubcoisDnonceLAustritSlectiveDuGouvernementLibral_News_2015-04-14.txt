"More than 7,000 Quebeckers among the most vulnerable will no longer have access to their treatments; They will probably have to return to the street or to the hospital, where their support costs $ 600 a day. This extreme cut of help to the poorest is a real machine to create roaming. Once again, it is selective austerity that liberal ministers practice; The Minister delegated to Rehabilitation, the Protection of Youth and Public Health, Lucie Charlebois, should be embarrassed to associate with such a cup that will directly affect the clientele that she has the responsibility to defend, Added the member for Rosemont.
