Quebec- The member for Beauharnois and official opposition on the fauna and parks, Guy Leclair, denounces the cup of a hundred positions of professionals, including dozens of scientists, at the Ministry of Forests, of Wildlife and parks (MFFP). 
"The Couillard government goes to Harper mode. The musological scientists is a characteristic strategy of an authoritarian government. Those of the MFFP are the guard dogs of our fauna and our parks; Their retention is essential for sustainable development as well as the protection of our biodiversity and threatened species, "said Guy Leclair. 
The hon. Member recalls that the forest, wildlife and parks are a very important economic engine for the whole Quebec, particularly for the regions. Again, therefore, the regions of Quebec are the victims of liberal austerity policies. 
"Quebec is preparing to adopt the 2015-2020 revised Government Sustainable Development Strategy. Of the 8 major orientations it contains is the management of natural resources responsibly and respectful of biodiversity. However, the cups jeopardize the achievement of this objective. The liberal inconsistency makes terribly in the regions, "concluded the member for Beauharnois.
