Quebec- The member for Beauharnois and official opposition for the fauna and parks, Guy Leclair, denounces the liberal government's budget cuts at the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, who involve the loss of Dozens of jobs, particularly in the regions of Quebec. 
"Since 2009, the number of wildlife officers has already declined in Quebec. During the study of budget appropriations, Minister Laurent Lessard confirmed that there could certainly have a lack of staff and that it would replace each retirement. Why did he change his mind? ", Asked Guy Leclair. 
The member for Beauharnois also recalls that the low number of wildlife officers puts their lives in danger and delays the time of interventions during the intrusion of dangerous animals in urban areas. Let us mention that the mortality rate of wildlife agents is already the highest among peace officers in Quebec. 
"These cups again demonstrate the lack of vision of the Liberal government as to the need to preserve the expertise in the Quebec public service. Minister Laurent Lessard jeopardizes several important projects for the preservation of species, as well as the quality of the environment, "continued Guy Leclair. 
Lack of vision of the Liberal Party 
The spokesperson also indicates that these cups are made before the first conclusion of the work of the Standing Committee on Programs. "Dozens of lost jobs are a new blow for the job situation in Quebec, especially in our regions. Liberals have no plan for economic development and job creation; They only have austerity in mind, "said Guy Leclair.
