Quebec- The member for Beauharnois and official opposition spokesman on fauna and parks, Guy Leclair, denounces the fact that the Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, Laurent Lessard, decided to abolish 16 wildlife protection agent positions. 
These cups are added to the 70 wildlife protection agent positions that were always filling. The situation becomes worrying because, at the dawn of the hunting season, a quarter of the workforce necessary for the protection of Quebec fauna is at home. Even worse, some agents received the directive not to leave more than 30 km from their regional office and only intervene in cases of heavy poaching to reduce gas bills. 
"Not only does the minister's decision jeopardize the safety of the citizens in the forest, but also opens up the door to a poaching festival in Quebec in the coming months. Is the minister aware of the invitation he sends to poachers? ", Asked Guy Leclair. 
In the study of budget appropriations, the Minister had nevertheless committed to replacing each wildlife protection officer, when he departs, by a graduate of the Duchesnay Training Center. But, on the ground, the situation is quite different; We recently learned that because of government cuts, promotion 2014 was canceled. In addition, no agent will be trained this year. 
"Fewer agents in the field, fewer agents at school: the fauna and safety of Quebeckers in the forest are victims of the Liberal government. The President of the Treasury Board speaks of social dialogue, but neither trade unions nor students nor citizens were consulted or even simply informed of these decisions before they were broadcast in the media, "added Guy Leclair . 
The member for Beauharnois also recalls that the low number of wildlife officers puts their lives in danger because it delays their interventions during the intrusion of dangerous animals in urban areas. Finally, the mortality rate for wildlife agents is already the highest among peace officers in Quebec.
