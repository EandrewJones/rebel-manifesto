Quebec- The member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, youth protection, home care and prevention, Jean-François Lisée, and the member for Lac-Saint-Jean and Speaker on Justice, Alexandre Cloutier, deplore that the Liberal government persists in proposing measures that will affect our families and the most vulnerable. Here is now he cares for victims of criminal acts. 
Following an article reporting on the compensation for victims of criminal acts, Jean-Francois listed questioned the Minister of Justice, Stephanie Vallée, as well as the Prime Minister. The latter confirmed that the compensation program will undergo cuts. 
"How can we consider cutting help to people who have been victims of a criminal act? This government decidedly shows a great compassion deficit. After canceling 15,000 places in childcare, coupe in assistance to homework and food aid, and challenged the parental insurance plan today, it wants to cut in support for men and women who have suffered serious trauma or mourning. The Minister of Justice refused to close the door to a reduction in sums reserved for victims of crime. The Prime Minister must commit themselves unequivocally that these people are not, in addition, victims of his compressions, "said Jean-Francois Lisée. 
Alexandre Cloutier is surprised at the questioning of this program. "In May 2013, the Government of the Parti Québécois had unanimously adopted Bill 22, which had the compensation scheme. We have heard the poignant testimonies of Isabelle Gaston, Michel Surprising and several other victims who demanded this bonus. Why question it today? It is an unacceptable lack of compassion from the Liberal government, "he concluded.
