Quebec- The member for Joliette and sentence of the official opposition in the field of culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, calls on the Minister of Culture and Communications, Hélène David, to act in the file of cuts without previous imposed on Radio-Canada. 
These cups will have an even greater impact than we expected, we learned yesterday. Indeed, in several regions of Quebec, the telejournals will be amputated 30 minutes. Once again, because they will lose a significant part of the resources granted to local information, regions are hit hard. 
"Since his arrival in the government, Minister Hélène David has made no concrete gestures in the CBC file, as well as in the future of regional information in general. It took a motion adopted unanimously to the National Assembly so that it sort of silence. What does she intend to do? Did she talk about her federal counterpart? The motion adopted at the National Assembly is clear: the minister must undertake an approach to the federal government, "said Véronique Hivon. 
The motion adopted on November 26th stressed the important contribution of Radio-Canada to cultural production, information and entertainment in Quebec. All parties represented in the National Assembly then expressed concerns about the cuts and confirmed their support for Radio-Canada and its craftsmen. 
"The cuts imposed on Radio-Canada will not have no effect on the quality of cultural production and access to information in our regions. This is an essential pillar of democracy. The Liberal government and the Minister of Culture and Communications must defend the interests of Quebecers in front of Ottawa, "said the member for Joliette.
