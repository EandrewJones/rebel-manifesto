Quebec- The Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, denounces the cuts carried out in the CAUTION network in Quebec. 
"The Liberal government has no limit to the damage it is ready to cause to realize its austerity program. The early childhood centers program made Quebec the paradise of families. It acts with young children to increase school integration and success, and has allowed thousands of women to integrate the labor market. This is the equal opportunities program. However, the Liberal government strives to weaken it. He has done everything for a year to promote non-subsidized private daycares. And, now, he wants to cut $ 120 million by leveling down throughout the subsidized daycare network. The economic model of the government is to blindly cut into the education of our children, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"The cuts announced by the government are the equivalent of 2800 educators who intervene every day with our children. It is 12% of all educators working in our early childhood centers, predominantly employed positions. It's a real attack on family policy. However, in response, the Prime Minister preferred to continue talking about everything except custody cuts, "he added. 
Remember that the Prime Minister, during his opening address, "we will continue the development of child care by putting middle-class or low-income families safe from a tariff shock. » 
"The Liberal government and its Prime Minister continues to strive on the early childhood centers, while they were elected by promising the opposite during the 2014 election campaign. They did not say a only word. According to the Prime Minister's commitment to his opening speech, they should rather be limited to indexing the rates. The Prime Minister must give up cutting these additional 120 million in the child care network, "concluded the official opposition.
