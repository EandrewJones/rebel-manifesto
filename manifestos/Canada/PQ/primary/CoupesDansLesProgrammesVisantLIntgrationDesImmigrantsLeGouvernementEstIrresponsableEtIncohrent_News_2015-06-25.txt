Quebec- The member for Bourget and spokesperson for the official immigration and head of the French language charter, Maka Kotto, deplores that the Couillard Government makes, soft, compressions in two programs put in place to help newcomers become familiar with Quebec. 
Indeed, Qu√©bec announced a 25% reduction in the number of sessions offered to immigrants. "Last week, we were talking about increasing the immigration thresholds and this week we want to cut in the integration courses. Specialists and middle actors, however, warned the Government on the insufficiency of the current services dedicated to the integration of immigrants. In this regard, also, liberal austerity hit several organizations dedicated to better integration of newcomers, "said Maka Kotto. 
Minister Kathleen Weil justified these cups by invoking a decline in demand. "At present, these courses are not mandatory. Rather than reduce them, the government should, on the contrary, make an effort to promote them; This would bring more newcomers to benefit and provide them with better social, cultural and vocational integration, "continued the member for Bourget. 
"Better to know about Quebec and its culture is an essential key for the successful integration of newcomers. The government must come together, act responsibly and give up increase the immigration thresholds; It should rather think about concrete gestures that would ensure that we are able to welcome the 50,000 immigrants who already arrive in Quebec annually, "concluded Maka Kotto.
