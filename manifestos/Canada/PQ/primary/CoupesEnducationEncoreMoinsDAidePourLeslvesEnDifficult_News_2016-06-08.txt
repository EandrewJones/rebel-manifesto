Quebec- While the equivalent of 122 positions of professionals will be abolished in schools at the next school year, these cups adding to all the others already announced, the spokesman of the Parti Party in terms of education, of Research and School Perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, regrets that the Minister of Education refused this morning to commit to preventing these new compressions. 
"Since the arrival of the Liberals in power, they are hundreds of speech therapists, psychologists, special education technicians and psychoeducators who are no longer present in our schools to support and encourage our young people most likely to win. The needs are shy and all the government finds to do is cut more. The cuts of the government have already done and continue to be extremely bad, and here we learn that the minister adds a layer! "Exhibited Alexander Cloutier. 
Indeed, the staff plans of nearly 60 school boards for next year are unequivocal: not only does the government not correct the situation, but, worse, it is used to aggravate . 
"The number of students in difficulty has increased by 55% in schools over the last 15 years. Despite this, the government continues to cut by hundreds of millions in direct services to students. In two years, the Liberals will have withdrawn from our schools more than 372 professionals, yet essential to academic success, supposed their battle horse. Should we remember that after two years of unnecessary debates on education structures, the government finally committed to action for academic success? Why, in this case, his first gesture is to cut even more in the resources dedicated to students who are likely to win? Although the minister says he will create some extra positions here and there in some circles, needs are screaming, "concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
