Quebec- The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesman for the Quebecois in education, research and educational perseverance, Alexander Cloutier, strongly denounces the fact that some schools from the Laval School Board are forced to Cut an additional $ 1.3 million in 2016-2017, due to the Quebec government's budget rules unveiled this summer. 
"While this year, the Laval School Board must deal with 350 new Syrian students, it is obliged to delete the 20 positions counted by its Francization Service. In fact, she had to choose between sacrificing services to students in difficulty or those for children who do not speak a word of French. However, since students in difficulty have made the expense of the latest compressions this year, it is the turn of the Francization service; it's foolish! When will this government stop tackling direct services to students? , Asked the spokesman. 
"Let us remember: Philippe Couillard stated that Quebec had the means to welcome Syrian refugees. But, surprise! It is learned this morning that even for some children who leave zero in French, there is no more available resource, "said the member for Lac-Saint-Jean. 
"The last update of the Ministry of Finance reveals that in the first quarter of 2016, the government has devoted $ 10 million less to education than for the same period last year. How can the Prime Minister and his Minister of Education, SÃ©bastien Proull, claim that the cuts are over and the government reinvests, while there is less money? The Liberals make fun of the population, "concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
