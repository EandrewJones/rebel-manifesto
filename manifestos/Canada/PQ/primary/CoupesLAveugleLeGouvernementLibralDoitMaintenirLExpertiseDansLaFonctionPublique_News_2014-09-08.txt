Quebec- The Parti Québécois asks the Liberal government to continue the work started, when it was in power, to rebuild the expertise in the Quebec public service. 
"The loss of expertise leads to additional costs for the state and for citizens. Government's cuts should not affect the basics of the effectiveness of our services. Quebec must be able to ensure its missions in the interest and respecting the means of its citizens, "said the hon. Member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard. 
The obligation to use private firms has resulted in exorbitant additional costs in several projects, whether in transport or computer science. The Parti Québécois wants the work it had undertaken, as a government, continues. 
"The Quebec state needs engineers to carry out its road projects, computer science specialists for its functioning, as well as wildlife agents and biologists to maintain its forest and ensure the well-being of animal species, has Added the official opposition spokesperson for Treasury Board and Information Technology, Élaine Zakaïb. Recent sections in the wildlife sector have nothing good. The state must be able to fulfill its mandates, which is part of the conservation of its territory, "she mentioned. 
For its part, the hon. Member for Rimouski, Harold Lebel, believes that the IT expertise of Rimouski is a good example of decentralization of jobs in the public service, in addition to playing a leading role in rebuilding expertise. 
"The Parti Québécois is the party of the regions, and the establishment of a center of expertise at Bas-Saint-Laurent is a concrete illustration. Will the Liberal government cut these jobs in the region? It would once again demonstrate that he does not have a vision or plan for the economic development of the regions of Quebec, "concluded the member.
