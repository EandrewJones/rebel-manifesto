Québec- The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in the field of women's condition, Carole Poirier, notes a little more every day how the minister responsible for the status of women, Lise Thériault, embodies "feminism in his own way": today She refused to commit to restoring the funding of the 16 Quebec organizations specializing in women's labor development, further weakening support for women's employability. 
In the last budget, the government has amputated 60% funding for these organizations from $ 1.2 million to $ 500,000. "At the time, the Minister of Justice had promised to create a committee that would work quickly to support the global mission of the groups. A year later, the verdict is without appeal: no funding is available. It is essential to restore the 1.2 million envelope at the next budget. Minister Thériault must act immediately to help women integrate or reintegrate the labor market, "said Carole Poirier. 
The hon. Member recalls that over the last 30 years, these 16 organizations working in 11 regions of Quebec have changed lives by developing a coherent approach and a major and specialized expertise to help women on the market. work. In 2014, an evaluation of the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Solidarity confirmed the very positive results of the work of these women's groups: 
"The advancement of women goes through concrete gestures and not with pious wishes. The austerity imposed by this government weakens the regional expertise that supports women of Quebec. How can Lise Thériault come forward in front of the members of the collective March 8 and promise them that it will fight for equality between men and women? How can it file a motion to emphasize the International Day of Women's Rights when, by its actions, it makes them back? "Concluded Carole Poirier.
