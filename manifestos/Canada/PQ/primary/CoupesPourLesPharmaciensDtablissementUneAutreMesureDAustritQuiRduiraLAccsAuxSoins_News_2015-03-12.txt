Quebec- The member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, youth protection, home care and prevention, Jean-François Lisée, denounces another austerity measure that will come to allocate Directly access to health care and health services for patients: this time, the government is attacking settlement pharmacists. 
"By cutting 15 to 45% the salary of pharmacists who work in health facilities, the Minister has been undertaking the efforts that have been made for three years to find a solution to the precarious situation of the pharmaceutical workforce in the Institutions, increase the supply of services and reduce the use of troubleshooting and additional time, "said Jean-François Lisée. 
The hon. Member recalls that settlement pharmacists are rare; The sector is struggling with the worst shortage of health network staff. From the admission of Quebec's Order of Pharmacists, whose mission is to protect the public, "radical" cuts in the remuneration of pharmacists who exercise in hospitals will aggravate this shortage and reduce patient services. 
Jean-François Lisée also stressed that institutional pharmacists offer services to both hospitalized patients and those enrolled in the emergency room or who are followed in ambulatory clinics (diabetes clinics, heart failure or renal, chemotherapy, etc.). They also perform clinical, teaching and management tasks. 
"The Prime Minister must come back to the completely senseless and counterproductive decision of his minister because it will only have harmful effects; The costs it will lead to the network will clearly exceed the hoped savings, "he continued.
