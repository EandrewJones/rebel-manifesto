Quebec, on June 5, 2020 - The member for René-Lévesque and spokespersons of the Parti Québécois in the field of economy and for SMEs, Martin Ouellet, asks the Government to put in place measures that will allow companies in Quebec to promote Telework, a practice encouraged by public health that will ensure the consequences of a possible second wave of COVID-19. 
IN SHORT 
Public health is clear: where possible, companies are encouraged to enable and facilitate teleworking. "It's logical: the more we reduce contacts between people - in offices, public transport, etc. - Better defeat the spread of the virus. In theory, it seems simple. But, in practice, companies, and especially SMEs, need to be supported in this technological turn. Although they have done their best this spring, it must be recognized that they do not have the same resources as the public sector, "said the member for René-Lévesque. 
The Government of Quebec must support companies with concrete measures and, thus allow them to set up, for good, teleworking for more workers. Government support can also be declined in many ways. "It is imperative to financially support companies for the purchase of equipment, licenses and technological infrastructure needed for teleworking. In addition, the government could offer tax incentives for every day teleworked by an employee. I offer my entire collaboration to the government for the implementation of these measures, which could be detailed in collaboration with the representatives of the economic and workers, "concluded Martin Ouellet.
