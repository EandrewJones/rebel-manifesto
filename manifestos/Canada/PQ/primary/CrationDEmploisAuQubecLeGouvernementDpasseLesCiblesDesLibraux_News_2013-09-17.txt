Qu√©bec- In response to a question from the Leader of the Official Opposition to the National Assembly, the Quebec Prime Minister Pauline Marois reminds that employment is an obsession with his government. On page B.10 Budget Duplan 2012-2013, presented by the former Liberal Minister of Finance, Raymond Bachand, we could read that the Liberal government planned "a creation of 21,300 jobs in 2012" in Quebec. 
"Philippe Couillard should be delighted that my government has exceeded the forecast of the former Liberal Party's economic pillar, Raymond Bachand, with the creation of 30,800 jobs, nearly 10,000 jobs more than the PLQ wanted to create," Indicated Pauline Marois. 
For 2013, the last Bachand budget provided for the creation of 35,700 jobs. In the first eight months of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, the average level of employment is 62,200 jobs. Quebec is again on the right track to overcome the goals set by the Liberal government for 2013.
