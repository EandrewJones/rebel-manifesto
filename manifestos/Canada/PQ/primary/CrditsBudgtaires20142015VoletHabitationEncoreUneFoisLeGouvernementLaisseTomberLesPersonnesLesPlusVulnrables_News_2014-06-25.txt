Quebec- The hon. Member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and sentence of the official habitation opposition, Carole Poirier, denounces the liberal cuts in the various habitat improvement programs that will affect the Disabled people and low-income households living in rural areas. 
Indeed, the study of budget appropriations of the habitation component revealed that the budget of the home adaptation program (CAD) for people with disabilities would be reduced by two-thirds, and that of the Renovation Program, for aid to renovation. In the region, amputated by half. 
"It's very disturbing. We are talking about total cups of $ 28 million, including 19 million for the home adaptation program. The Parti Québécois had acted to reduce wait times to benefit from this program. The cuts may therefore prolong these deadlines again. How many people with disabilities will be penalized? Minister Pierre Moreau confessed that he did not realize any prior impact. It has no idea of the direct consequences of these cups on the lives of people who are waiting for help to adapt their home to their fitness, "said Carole Poirier. 
It should be remembered that the Quebecic Party government had made help to the most vulnerable people a priority. In November 2013, the member for Jonquière, then Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the Territory, Minister of Transport and Minister responsible for the Quebec Housing Corporation, Sylvain Gaudreault, had announced a change to the PAD. to reduce the processing time of certain requests. The average time was thus 45 months in 2006-2007 to 26 months in 2012-2013. 
"Once again, the Liberal government drops the most vulnerable people. Its budget decisions seriously compromise the improvement in the quality of life of low-income households in rural areas and that of people with disabilities, serving the support for the quest for autonomy of the latter ", concluded the spokesperson.
