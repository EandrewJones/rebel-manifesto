Quebec- The member for Labelle and sentence of the official opposition in sound habits of lifestyle, leisure and sports, Sylvain Pagé, deplores the slowness of the Liberal government in the issue of setting up a policy national sport, leisure and physical activity. 
"Not only does the Minister François Blais repel the adoption of such a policy, but it admits that little money will be available for the action plan. We had accomplished a considerable amount of work to make Quebec one of the most fit nations in the world, with the valuable cooperation of hundreds of partners from all regions of Quebec; That the culmination of all these efforts be constantly returned, since the election of the Liberals, it is particularly distinction, "said Sylvain Pagé. 
"The action plan must be ambitious; We must challenge all Quebec actors, from CPE to CHSLD. Unfortunately, the government really lacks leadership on this issue. Sedentarity is a growing plague, and the Liberals should understand that we could save more than $ 1.5 billion a year by fighting against obesity and encouraging healthy lifestyle habits. We must act now, "added the member. 
In addition, just as its predecessor, Minister François Blais could not explain how $ 900 million enrolled in PQI 2015-2025 will be used. It has not been able to demonstrate that its government had made any representation for recreational and sporting infrastructures to be eligible for Canada-Québec's next financial assistance program. "Clearly, the minister does not seem to grasp the extent of his records and, unfortunately, Quebeckers will still wait," concluded Sylvain Pagé.
