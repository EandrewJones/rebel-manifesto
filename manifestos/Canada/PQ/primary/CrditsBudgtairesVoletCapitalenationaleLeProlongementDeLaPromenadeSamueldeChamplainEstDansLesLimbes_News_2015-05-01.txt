Quebec- The member for Taschereau, a parliamentary leader of the official opposition and spokesperson for the Capitale-Nationale Region, Agnès Maltais, was very surprised to hear that the government has put a brake on the project to extend the extension of the Samuel-de Champlain promenade. 
"When it were in the opposition, the minister responsible for the Capitale-Nationale Region, Sam Hamad, preached the importance of proceeding quickly to Phase III; However, he admitted today that not only the project is postponed but, worse, that there is no more timetable, despite the liberal promises on this matter made in the election campaign. Even his colleague, the Liberal MP Montmorency, Raymond Bernier, took advantage of his speaking time to remind the Minister the importance of the project, insisting that this one was expensive at the heart of people. Why does the Liberal government take into account? Asked Agnès Maltese. 
Regional service agreements in the future uncertain 
During the study of the appropriations, as she questioned Sam Hamad about the effects of the abolition of Crees on the future of specific agreements, the member for Taschereau herself learned the minister that agreements for improvement Conditions of life of seniors and for the status of women would not be renewed. "It is flaunting that the minister responsible for the Capitale-Nationale does not realize today the impact of its government's decisions on its ability to act when it comes to regional priorities. He must now be satisfied with wishful vows, and they are the citizens who, once again, make it the costs, "concluded the member for Taschereau.
