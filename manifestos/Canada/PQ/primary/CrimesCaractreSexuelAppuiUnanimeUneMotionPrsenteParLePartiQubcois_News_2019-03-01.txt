Quebec, February 28, 2019 - The member for Joliette and Spokesperson for the Second Justice Opposition Group, Véronique Hivon, again obtained the unanimity of the members of the National Assembly, this time for the benefit of the victims sexual assault. 
IN SHORT 
Véronique HIVON expressed it on many occasions, already: if a sexual crime was committed, even if it goes back several decades, its author must be able to be prosecuted. The victims of this type of aggression do not have to undergo the pressure of the limitation period; They often need time, among others to find the strength to denounce, and their healing process must be respected. 
"Too many victims of sexual crimes are waiting for this moment for years. They claim, justice, justice and repair. A crime is a crime, an aggression remains an aggression, regardless of when the gestures caused harmful, "said the spokesperson immediately. 
"We look forward to the unanimous support of parliamentarians, today, for the abolition of the limitation period. Then, given the fact that the CAQ also demanded this intervention when it was in the opposition, we expect the Minister of Justice, Sonia Lebel, quickly follows this vote and that it modifies the Civil Code so that all victims of a sexual crime can hope for one day when they have decided it, obtain reparation, "concluded Véronique Hivon.
