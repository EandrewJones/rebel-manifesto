Quebec - "I have never seen that! As a result of the entry of the deputy of Saint-Maurice and vice-president of the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries, Energy and Natural Resources, Claude Pinard, relative to the unexpected absence of directors of the Fiscal Financial of Quebec yesterday in committee. "The last time we had to summon by" subpoena ", it was in the case of Mount Orford and it was a private company. In this case, it is the directors of a Crown corporation. It's very disturbing, "continued the member. 
The directors of the Québec's agricultural financial financial officers, who deny the very serious crisis in pig producers, oxen, lambs and small cereals, refuse to testify in parliamentary committee despite the fact that they have been summoned three times. 
In addition, the financial is still slowed to make parliamentarians with all the documents required since June by the Commission. 
"Since 2003, we have the impression that the Liberals denature the mandate of the Financial, which is to protect revenue with a view to promoting the success and sustainability of Quebec agricultural enterprises. In doing so, the Liberals are close to the crisis in the agricultural environment and on the hundreds of small and medium-sized québécoise closures. It's flavored and it's high time that it changed, "continued the official opposition spokesperson for agriculture and food and MP for Kamouraska-Témiscouata, André Simard. 
"By denying the existence of the crisis and refusing to appear in parliamentary committee, agricultural financial fiscal is likely to respect Quebec farmers and to parliamentarians," lamented André Simard. 
"Financial administrators will now have other choices than to testify and provide the documents required by the Commission. Solutions must be found and implemented quickly for the good of Quebec agriculture, "concluded the member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata.
