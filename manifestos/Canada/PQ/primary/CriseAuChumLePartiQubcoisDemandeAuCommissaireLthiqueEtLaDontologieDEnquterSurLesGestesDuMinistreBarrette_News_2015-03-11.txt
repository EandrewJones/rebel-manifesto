Quebec- The member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for ethics and integrity, Stéphane Bergeron, confirms that he asked Monday to the Ethics Commissioner and the Ethics to investigate On the actions of Minister Gaétan barrette related to nominations at the University of Montreal (CHUM) hospital. 
"I asked the Commissioner to investigate the ethics and ethics code of the members of the National Assembly that could have committed the Minister of Health and Social Services by interging in the appointment process. Chum Department Directors, particularly on its intervention to promote the appointment of Dr. Patrick Harris as Director of the Department of Surgery. We have reasonable grounds to believe that the Minister has committed a breach of section 16 of the Code, which states that: 
"In the exercise of his office, a member can not: 
1 ° to act, attempt to act or omit to act in order to promote his personal interests, those of a member of his immediate family or those of one of his children not dependent or, in an abusive way, those from any other person; 
2 ° to take advantage of its office to influence or attempt to influence the decision of another person so as to promote his personal interests, those of a member of his immediate family or those of one of his children not charge or , in an abusive way, those of any other person. " 
The crisis that the CHUM crosses is not linked to Jacques Turgeon's return to his head, but to the minister's unacceptable actions. The latter has visibly attempted to influence the decision of the Chief Director and the Board of Directors of the CHUM, even going so far as to pressure on them, in order to promote the appointment of Dr. Harris as Director of the Department of Surgery of the establishment. This constitutes a sprain in our code of ethics and ethics, "said Stéphane Bergeron.
