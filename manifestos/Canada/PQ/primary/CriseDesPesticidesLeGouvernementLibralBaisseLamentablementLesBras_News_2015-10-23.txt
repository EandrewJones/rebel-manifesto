Quebec- The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in agriculture, food, SME, entrepreneurship and innovation and deputy of Berthier, André Villeneuve, as well as the spokesperson for sustainable development, Environment and Fighting Climate Change and MPs of Terrebonne, Mathieu Traversy, deplore the admission of government's impotence in the pesticide issue present in Quebec's streams. Yesterday, when asked to respond to the revelations that the presence of toxic products in our environment would have reached a concern, the Liberal Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, said that "Monsanto and the others of this kind "were still" more powerful than the Quebec government. 
The minister must do something and, above all, refuse to bow to multinationals. "The words of Pierre Paradis are unacceptable. It is an admission of impotence with which we are fully disagree. The government has the means to act. He can not let farmers manage with the problem, "said André Villeneuve. 
It is necessary to significantly reduce the use of pesticides in Quebec, promote natural alternatives for harmful insect management and encourage organic farming. "The report of the Ministry of the Environment mentions that pesticides contaminate the watercourses of agricultural regions of Quebec in almost 100% of cases. The problem is that for some products, Quebec has not yet determined the thresholds acceptable in water, their use still too recent. What will the Minister of the Environment go to tackle the deficient management of pesticides in Quebec? , "Added Mathieu Traversy. 
"Once again, the government needed a report to focus on a problem that experts are trying to raise awareness for several months. He is aware of the situation, but did not do anything to settle it. Yet the means exist, as evidenced by the European and Ontario experiences. The minister has the power to regulate and, thus, to enable Quebec to catch up on the subject, "have concluded members.
