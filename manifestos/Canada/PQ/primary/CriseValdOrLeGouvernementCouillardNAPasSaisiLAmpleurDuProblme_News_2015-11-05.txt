Qu√©bec- following the meeting yesterday between the Prime Minister and the Aboriginal leaders of the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec and Labrador, the Quebec Party Word of Party for Women's Status and Housing Party , Carole Poirier, and the indigenous business spokesman, Guy Leclair, arrested the Liberal government to commit to moving forward with an action plan to combat racism and Discrimination against Aboriginal people, by Christmas. 
"The Liberal government believes that with a simple SPVM survey and a two-hour meeting with the leaders, the problem affecting the Aboriginal women of Val-d'Or will be settled. We too went to meet the leaders. We listened to them and understood that the roots of the problem are much deeper. Racism for Aboriginal people is institutionalized and particularly harmful to women. To solve the problem, it will require a plan of action on racism and discrimination, "said Carole Poirier. 
On November 3rd, the Prime Minister claimed before the National Assembly that "it is true that a plan to combat discrimination must be approved." The Minister responsible for Aboriginal Affairs, Geoffrey Kelley, has refused today to engage in the preparation of such a plan. He even refused to pronounce the words "action plan", while a question on this subject was put to him three times. 
"Finally, let us remember that the government has appointed an observer without consulting Aboriginal people. A nation-to-nation relationship is not that. According to the Prime Minister, to resolve the crisis, we have only been able to point to the federal government, sprinkle a few million and hold a two-hour meeting. However, the problem is deeper. The Quebec government has the duty to tackle it quickly and more seriously, "added Guy Leclair.
