Quebec- The member for Saint John and official opposition spokesperson for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, today participated in the youth march organized by the crossroads Youth-Employment (CJE) of the Outaouais region, to denounce the liberal reform of the CEs and their mission. 
"For weeks, the mobilization of young people, CJEs and their stakeholders are not denied. The reform of the Minister François Blais does not pass. Given the current economic situation of Quebec, we can not leave 40,000 young people by sending them elsewhere. They are engaged in a process of reintegration into employment thanks to the services given by CEPs. The mission of these must therefore be preserved, "said Dave Turcotte.

"At a time when we speak, there is no guarantee regarding the maintenance of the resources and the mission of the CEs. It would have been so much easier to ask them to pay particular attention to young people who are furthest from the labor market, while providing support for all of their mission. It is a debate of structures, initiated and prosecuted by the Government, which does not take into account the particularities of the CJE mission, nor the place where they are implanted. We will continue to fight for no young person to be put aside and so that the CJE will be supported in their work. The government needs to go back, "concluded Dave Turcotte.
