Following a wastewater spill in the Yamaska River, the member for Terrebonne and spokesman for the Quebecois environment, Mathieu Traversy, asks Minister David Hréttel to change the ways to make his department And to take into account three proposals made by the Parti Québécois for months. 
"Since the Flushgate, David Heurtel has not changed its wastewater management. Through requests for access to information, we have demonstrated that 92 notices of non-compliance have been submitted to 69 municipalities between November 2015 and March 2016, for an amount of just $ 1,000 in fine. Only 52% of the inspections planned in the program? Verification discharge notice? were carried out in 2014-2015. In Quebec, no report lists overopens that occur in municipalities, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
The Parti Québécois offers three concrete actions to set up quickly: 
1) more inspections and the application of more systematic and severe sanctions to municipalities; 
2) Make public a scalable dashboard on discharges by overwhelming works in Quebec: Nature and volumes of spilled wastewater, followed by the patches prescribed to municipalities. To achieve this, return to the centralization of the collection, validation and publication of data on the follow-up of wastewater sewerage works by the Ministry of the Environment, rather than transferring these responsibilities to municipalities; 
3) Creation of a specific public registry for applications for authorization made by municipalities for wastewater discharges. 
"Municipalities should also be supported so that they can improve and regularize their wastewater management structures. Infrastructure funding must be increased and facilitated. Regarding the spill in Saint-Hyacinthe, the Minister must make public all documents on the Ministry's website; We must know in any transparency what happened, "concluded Mathieu Traversy.
