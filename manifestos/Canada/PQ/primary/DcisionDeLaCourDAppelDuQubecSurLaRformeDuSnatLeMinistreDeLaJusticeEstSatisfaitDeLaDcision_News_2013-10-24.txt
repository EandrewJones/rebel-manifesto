Quebec- The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, is satisfied with the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal, which declares unconstitutional Bill C-7 proposed by the federal government to modify the Senate. 
"I welcome the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal. This Court affirms very clearly that Ottawa can not act alone to reform the Senate, such a reform that can only be done in the context of a multilateral negotiation, "said Minister Bertrand St-Arnaud. 
In his decision the Court of Appeal states that "the federal bill, if it had been adopted, would have been [...] since it constituted, by its true nature, a modification to the mode of selection of senators and Powers of the Senate, without respecting the planned process, but instead trying to circumvent it ". 
"Strong of this unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal, we will continue to oppose federal unilateralism as part of the referral to the Senate reform addressed by the federal government to the Supreme Court," concluded Minister Bertrand St -Marnaud. 
Indeed, in the margins of this notice requested from the Quebec Court of Appeal, the federal government submitted its draft reform of the Senate to the Supreme Court as part of a removal procedure. The hearing before the Supreme Court will take place on 12, 13 and 14 November.
