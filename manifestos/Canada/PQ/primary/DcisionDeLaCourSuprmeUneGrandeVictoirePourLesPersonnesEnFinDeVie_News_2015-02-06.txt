Quebec- The hon. Member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, as well as the member for Joliette and Spokesperson in terms of end-of-life care, Véronique Hivon, reacted to the decision of the Supreme Court on the medical help to die. 
"It's a great day for solidarity, compassion and respect for the person's autonomy. It is also a great day for Quebeckers who participated in this important democratic process that has defined the contours of a human approach to end-of-life care. Collectively, Quebec traced the way, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
"The decision of the Supreme Court recognizes the Quebec approach of the Special Commission on the issue of dying in dignity as well as the law on end-of-life care. I pay tribute to the people who came to testify and who took part in this great democratic exercise. It is the meeting of several courses, citizens, associations and elected officials that allowed the adoption of this law and the shaping of the decision made this morning, "concluded the member for Joliette.
