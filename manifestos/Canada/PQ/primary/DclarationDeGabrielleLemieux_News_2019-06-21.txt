Montreal, June 21, 2019 - The President of the Parti Québécois, Gabrielle Lemieux, issued the following statement regarding his departure next November: 
"I decided that my mandate to the Presidency of the Parti Québécois would end next November, at the Extraordinary National Congress. As a volunteer, I have to face the challenge of employment conciliation, family and political involvement. I managed to take up it over the last two years, but in November the time will come for me to withdraw. 
I deeply believe in the recovery approach we started last March and that's why I make the choice to stay in the November Congress, to end her. This approach is a first, since we chose to modernize our party in depth and without taboos while posting the race to the chieftaincy. 
I am proud to have led the proposal of an action plan at the beginning of the year, which was unanimously adopted at the National Council in March. This plan of action for a new Parti Québécois is carried by a competent and dedicated national executive council, a strong branch, a parliamentary leader and a committed and passionate caucus. I have all confidence that the presidency next November will be able to direct the implementation of the changes voted to the congress and organize the race to the chieftaincy. Concluded the president of the Quebecois Party, Gabrielle Lemieux.
