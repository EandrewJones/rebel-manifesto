I took tonight the decision to withdraw my candidacy for the elections of October 1st. I do it with regret, for being a member of Beauharnois for 10 years was the most beautiful professional challenge that life has granted me. 
I am confident that justice will inform me of the accusation against me today and I am grateful to my chief of defending my right of citizen at the presumption of innocence. However, I believe that the election of the Parti Québécois is too important for my personal case to divert the attention of our generous and pragmatic proposals, from our fight for the independence, of our team which, I know, will know so well Serve Quebecers and Quebeckers. 
I will contribute in the coming days to choose a new candidacy that will continue the work of defense of the citizens of Beauharnois that I greet and thanks from the bottom of the heart.
