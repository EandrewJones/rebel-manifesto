Quebec, on February 28, 2017- The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on public safety, Pascal Bérubé, responds to the information obtained by the press reporting a letter sent to the SPVM in February 2014. 
"While Stéphane Bergeron was Minister of Public Security, procedures were underway in court. The Minister should not intervene. We learn by the media today that a letter had been sent to the Director of SPVM at the time, Marc Parent; The Deputy Minister of Public Safety was placed in compliant copy. The minister has never been informed of the existence of this letter. Now, once in place, the new Minister of Public Security has been informed? We do not know, "said Pascal Bérubé.
