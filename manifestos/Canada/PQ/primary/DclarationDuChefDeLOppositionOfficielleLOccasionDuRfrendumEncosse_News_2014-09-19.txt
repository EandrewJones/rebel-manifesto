Quebec- The hon. Member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, reacted to the results of the referendum held in Scotland. 
"After a positive campaign that lasted several months, it is in peace and with the greatest respect for democracy that the Scottish people were able to discuss its future and vote. 
This desire to give oneself a country has mobilized all Scotland. 
With pride, the Scots went to vote in large numbers. 
Of all backgrounds, of all ages, of all origins, they were more than 84% to exercise their duty as a citizen and take a voting position. 
The result of this referendum demonstrates how powerful the Scottish independence movement is powerful. Because the process was irreproachable and caused everyone's participation, it's all the scotland that is growing. 
All have accepted the rules of democracy, especially that of an absolute majority, of 50% + 1. 
The result allows this nation to consider its future with force. The British Government, which has been respectful of the process leading to the referendum vote, has also announced that it would increase its dialogue with the Scottish Nation. 
Congratulations to Scots for their inspiring approach! 
Our two nations have a lot to say and so much to learn from each other. We will continue to strengthen our links with Scotland, or even intensify them. »
