Quebec- The member for Saint-Jérôme and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, wished to wish all Quebeckers and all Quebeckers, very beautiful celebrations on the occasion of the National Day. 
"On June 24, it is the feast of all Quebeckers and all Quebeckers. Everywhere on our territory, in all our regions, we will be hundreds of thousands to participate in the many organized activities. Together, with family, with friends, in the neighborhood, we will celebrate our pride in belonging to this great Francophone people of America. 
Take a moment to stop at the profound significance of this special day. Let us remember the struggles, values, ideals and achievements that have made us the warm and open nation that we are. And we can become even more; It only takes us to score history again. The future belongs to us. 
More and more, by the world, the voice of Quebecers and Quebeckers is heard, innovative, creative, unique. She tells our culture, our audacity, our successes. She does it without imposing limits, in a harmonious and generous way, to our image. Let's be proud! 
On behalf of the entire Partician team, I wish you very nice celebrations on our national holiday. »
