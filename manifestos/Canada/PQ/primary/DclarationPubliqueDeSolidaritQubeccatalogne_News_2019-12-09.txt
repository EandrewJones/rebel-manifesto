Because the situation in which Catalonia is located, especially since October 2017, we are seriously worrying about us: 
Faced with the incarceration and condemnation of Jordi Sànchez and Jordi Cuixart, respectively Presidents of the Nacional Catalana and òmnium Cultural Assembly, two major Catalan civil society organizations; 
DEVER THE INCARCÉRATION et la Condamnation from members democratically Élus du gouvernement Catalan Oriol Junqueras, Dolors Bassa, Raül Romeva, Jordi Turull, Carme Forcadell, Joaquim Forn et Josep Rull; 
Faced with the sentences of inhabilitation and fines imposed on democratically elected members of the Catalan Government of Meritxell Borràs, Carles Mundó and Santi Vila; 
Before the arrest warrants issued against the elected members of the government, currently in exile, including the President and Current Member of Parliament Carles Puigdemont, the Ministers Clara Ponsatí, Lluís Puig and Antoni Comín; 
Before the exile also imposed on the elected members of the Catalan Parliament Meritxell Serret, Marta Rovira and Anna Gabriel; 
Faced with the repression and use of violence by the Spanish government towards the Catalan people, the judicialization of the policy and the criminalization of the right to demonstrate; 
Before the violation of the civil and political rights of the Catalan people and its parliament; 
Before the refusal of the Government of Spain to sit down and negotiate a peaceful crisis exit; 
Before the immobilism of the international community: 
We, members of the Quebec coalition of solidarity towards Catalonia, express our support for the Catalan population that peacefully and democratically struggles for its right to self-determination; 
We denounce irregularities in trials and repeated interference from political powers in the Spanish judicial process; 
We firmly condemn convictions and disproportionate sentences for sedition, malfeasance and disobedience against men and women who have only exercised their fundamental rights; 
We enjoining the international community, in the wake of denunciations, among others, by Amnesty International, to condemn the imprisonments of Catalan leaders, as well as the arrest warrants issued against people in exile; 
We call on the Spanish government of Amnestier Catalan leaders, to the release of those who are imprisoned and to cancel the arrest warrants against Carles Puigdemont and the other members of his government in exile . 
We also ask the entire international community, especially the Spanish Government, to recognize and respect the right to democracy, the right to decide and the right to self-determination of the Catalan people. 
We challenge the governments of Quebec and Canada to condemn imprisonment and clearly recognize these rights, in particular the right to self-determination. 
Because like Quebec and so many other nations around the world, the people of Catalonia has the right to democratically decide its political future. 
Because people have the right to be free!
