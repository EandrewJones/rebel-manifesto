I had the immense pleasure today to address the participants of the great meetings on school perseverance. This is an issue that is particularly expensive to me. It is also a crucial question for the future of our youth and Quebec in full. 
We know the many harmful consequences of school dropout. In the light of the challenges that the future reserves, a finding is necessary: Quebec needs all its young, and education is the preferred path to a better future. 
Act early, this is the key to success. I was already convinced in 1997, when I created an integrated family policy to contribute to the well-being of children, women and families: early childhood educational custody services in small, full-time kindergarten for Children 5 years, parental insurance plan and unified child allowance. It was an immense success, a success cited as an example by the OECD.
