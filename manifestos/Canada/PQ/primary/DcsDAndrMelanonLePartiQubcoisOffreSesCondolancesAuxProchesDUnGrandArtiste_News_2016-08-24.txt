I wish them a lot of serenity in the event, "first declared Sylvain Gaudreault. 
"We owe André Melançon of the flagship works of the Quebec cinematographic culture, films and emissions that have marked the spirits and who will remain classics. His talent and instinct have made him a respected mentor, among others by the members of the great family of the National Improvisation League. He clearly mastered the art of telling a story so as to directly touch the hearts of people, no matter their age. In his approach to approaching and seeing the world, there was this touch of wonderful, spontaneity that characterized him and who made his fame, "then said Mr. Gaudreault.
