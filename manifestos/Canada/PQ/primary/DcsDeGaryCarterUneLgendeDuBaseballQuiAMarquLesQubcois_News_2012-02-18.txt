Québec- As a result of the announcement, yesterday, the death of Gary Carter, the Parti Québécois wishes to offer its condolences to his family and loved ones. 
"Gary Carter was an idol for many Quebeckers and a model during his seasons with the Montreal Expos. It is a loss for the world of baseball, but also for all Montrealers and Quebeckers who have been fans of exhibitions, "said the member for Labelle and spokesperson for the official leisure and sports opposition, Sylvain Pagé. 
He was a tremendous ambassador for Montreal and an example of generosity during his visit to Quebec. "The sports fans of Quebec are mourning today. They lose the one who has probably been the biggest star of the history of exhibitions. It is also the first to have been inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown by wearing the exposure cap, in 2003. This enthronement is one of the last traces of the history of the exhibitions that will survive forever. In this sense, members and members of the Parti Québécois recognize the contribution of Mr. Carter to the Quebec sports world. He has made us live very nice times during his career in Montreal, "concluded Sylvain Pagé.
