We are all a little orphan today, "said Pauline Marois.

He will have collaborated with the biggest names of the Quebec scene and humor, like Guy LaTraverse, Dominique Michel, Louise LaTraverse, Yvon Deschamps or Clemence Desrochers. And who does not remember his imitations of Jean Flag, Gilles Vigneault, René Lévesque or Yves Montand? He has shown the way to the joyful cohort of humorists and imitators who today crowns all Quebec scenes, "added Maka Kotto.
