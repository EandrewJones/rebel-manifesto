DECLARATION OF MR LAURENT FABIUS: 
It is with sadness that I learned the death of the former Prime Minister Jacques Parizeau. I address his wife, his family, as well as to all Quebeckers, my sincere condolences. 
Mr. Parizeau has devoted his life to Quebec, first as a tree of the great reforms of the tranquil revolution, then as prime minister. It is a great Quebecker who disappears. 
France, with which Jacques Parizeau had strong links since his years of study in Paris, loses a friend, who has contributed significantly to the development of the particular relationship between our two governments, our companies, our citizens. 
His constant commitment to the Quebec service and his friendship for France will remain in our memories.
