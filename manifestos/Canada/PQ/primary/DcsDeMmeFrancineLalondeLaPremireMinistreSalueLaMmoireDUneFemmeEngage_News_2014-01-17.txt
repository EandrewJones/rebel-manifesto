Montreal-moved by the death of Ms. Francine Lalonde, the Quebec Prime Minister held to greet the memory of a woman she considers a model of commitment. "As much as a trade union and as a minister, Francine Lalonde has devoted his life to the service of his fellow citizens. Sovereignist activist in the soul, who is experiencing social justice and great defender of women's law, she has always shown, in each of the functions she has held, determination and elegance, "first declared Pauline Marois . 
The Premier also evoked a cause that was very expensive to the former member of the Bloc Québécois, the end-of-life care, on which the members of the National Assembly are looking at these days. "While Bill 52 wrote the stage of the detailed parliamentary committee yesterday, I can not help but emphasize the pioneering role that Francine Lalonde played on this issue. In the House of Commons, she bravely introduced a reflection, which has become necessary, on the right to die with dignity. Thanks to its perseverance, Ms. Lalonde helped make possible adoption, in Quebec, such law. » 
The future of Quebec has always been at the heart of the fighting of this committed woman. "As a spokesperson for his party in foreign affairs in the House of Commons, Francine Lalonde represented Quebec with dignity. It has established an immense network of contacts, for the benefit of the Quebec nation. Today, many people, around Quebec and elsewhere in the world, are mourning this exceptional woman. » 
The Premier offered his deepest condolences to the family and friends of Francine Lalonde, who accompanied him to the end. "Our thoughts are with you," Ms. Marois concluded.
