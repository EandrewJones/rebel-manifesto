Québec- In response to the death of Robert Roussil, the Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, wanted to pay tribute to this great Quebec sculptor who shared his life between France and Quebec, whose works can be admired in Montreal, Nice, or in Quito, in Ecuador. For example, the monumental sculpture will be retained in tribute to René-Lévesque, located in the Park René-Lévesque in Lachine, carried out in 1988. 
Coming from a modest family of Montreal and the penultimate of nine children, Robert Roussil left school very early to exercise a crowd of small trades. In 1942, he enlisted in the army and his return from the war, in 1945, he joined the Art School and Design of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts where he learned different techniques in sculpture . He participated in the renowned Montreal Sculpture Symposium in 1964. Convinced that a sculpture is not just a decorative element, he created the concept of habitable sculpture. 
"Robert Roussil was an artist, a visionary and an activist. He was an ardent defender of architecture integrated by the 1960s. His works described by some of the powerful and striking, in particular, allowed to open the spirits to less conventional forms of expression. Quebec loses a great sculptor, as great as his magistral works that will keep him alive in our memories, "said Minister Kotto. The minister wanted to express his condolences to Robert Roussil's relatives of Robert Roussil.
