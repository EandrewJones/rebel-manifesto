Montreal, on Friday, August 19, 2011 - On behalf of the Parliamentary Wing of the Parti Québécois, the official opposition leader of Charlevoix, Pauline Marois, offers his condolences to the family, relatives, friends and colleagues of the journalist and Writer Gil Courtemanche, died today. 
"Gil Courtemanche was part of a class apart. Engaged, the incisive feather, the free verb, it belonged to a journalistic genre that we see less and less: the one who denounces. Always on the side of the victims, never complacent with the powerful, he has made us discover unacceptable situations, all over the world, as in Quebec, "commented on the leader of the official opposition. 
While famine falls into the Horn of Africa, Pauline Marois wanted to remember that Gil Courtemanche had been one of the initiators, on the return of a report in Ethiopia, the collective of artists the eyes of the Hunger in 1985. He had written the text of this superb song whose selling fruits were intended to support Ethiopian populations. 
"Gil Courtemanche was indignant, but he was acting too. He was of those who had said, "Never, never again should we tolerate such a situation!" The simple fact that it takes, again today, to intervene in this humanitarian crisis is enough to show us that we will need other Gil Courtemanche to inform us, indignate and make us change, "said Pauline Marois.
