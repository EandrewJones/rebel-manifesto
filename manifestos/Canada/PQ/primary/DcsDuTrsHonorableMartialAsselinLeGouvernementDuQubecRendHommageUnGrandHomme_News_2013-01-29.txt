London - On behalf of the Government, the Prime Minister of Quebec, Ms. Pauline Marois, wishes to transmit his most sincere condolences to the family and relatives of the former Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, Mr. Martial Asselin. 
"The people of our house, in Charlevoix, have seen him early in his career as politician since he first invested on the local scene. But it is across Quebec and Canada that Mr. Asselin will be most illustrated. He imposed immense respect. It was also an authority figure and a commitment model. He is a man of great righteousness that Quebec loses, "said the Prime Minister. 
Mr. Asselin was admitted to the Barreau du Qu√©bec in 1951. He gave his entry into municipal political life in the late 1950s, becoming mayor of Malbaie, in his region of origin. He then held the position of MP for Charlevoix in the House of Commons, became minister, then a member of the Senate. From 1990 to 1996, he held the position of Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec. During his life, he received several honors and distinctions.
