Quebec, on December 14, 2016 -The MP for Duplessis, Lorraine Richard, request to hear Hydro-Québec and the Commission on Standards, Equity, Health and Labor Safety (CNESST) in Parliamentary Committee to obtain Responses to the issues raised by the four deaths on the Romaine site since 2010. 
"Hydro-Québec and the CNESST must tell us what measures have been put in place following the deaths of Gaétan Saucier, in 2010, of Steeve Barriault, March 2015, and Alex Antoine Proulx, last August. We sought the fastest way that can ensure explanations to the workers of Romaine and their families: it is a parliamentary committee, "said Lorraine Richard. 
"When we have crossed the commission's stage, if the responses obtained are not satisfactory or if they demonstrate a generalized problem, we do not close the door to seek a commission of inquiry. That said, our goal here is speed. Also mention that the creation of a working committee, announced by Hydro-Québec, is clearly insufficient, "said the member. 
"We went to the fourth death. We must act to reassure families and workers. These should not be worried when they go to the site; Hydro-Québec must therefore demonstrate that their safety will now be ensured when they go there. Finally, I offer, on behalf of my colleagues members of the Parti Quebec, my deepest condolences to the family and relatives of Luc Arpin, "concluded Lorraine Richard.
