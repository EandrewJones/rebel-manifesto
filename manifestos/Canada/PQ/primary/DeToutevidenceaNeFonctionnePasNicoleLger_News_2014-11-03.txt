Quebec, November 3, 2014 - Member of Pointe-Aux-Trembles and sentence of the official opposition in terms of primary and secondary education and school perseverance, Nicole Léger, notes the very low rate of participation in school elections and concludes that the status quo is no longer acceptable. 
School democracy "Although we have amply discussed the challenge on the public square in recent months, citizens have not mobilized during yesterday's ballot. It is clear that it does not work, "observes the member of the Parti Québécois. 
"School democracy is in a desolate situation, but that does not mean that we should exclude citizens from decisions made in Quebec schools. Rather, we believe that the decision-making bodies must be reviewed so that parents remain at the heart of governance, "she continued. 
Grouping of school boards  The Parti Québécois recalls that it advocates a reorganization of school boards. To do this, he proposes to: 
"Whatever changes to future changes in the network of education, success and school perseverance must be the government's priorities. We intend to hear the Liberal Party on this subject, since it seems to focus more on the columns of expenditure figures - it is seen by the cuts it has done in assistance to homework and food aid, in particular - only in the future of our children, "concluded Nicole Léger.
