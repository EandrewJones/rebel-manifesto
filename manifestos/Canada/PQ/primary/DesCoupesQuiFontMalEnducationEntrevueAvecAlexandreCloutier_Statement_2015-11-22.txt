As part of our National Council on 21 and 22 November 2015 in Sherbrooke, our guest blogger, Annick Vigeant, met Alexandre Cloutier. 
The austees of the Government of Philippe Couillard strike hard with the environment. When asks the member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesman of the Parti Québécois in education, research and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, what it will change concretely in the success of our young people, the answer does not I do not wait: everything! 
"The Liberal Party has closed half of regional support organizations for school perseverance. Those who remain are downright on the artificial respirator. They vivote so much we weakened them. " 
"Internally, the Couillard government cut into direct services to our young people: psychoeducators, psychologists, speech therapists, all have been affected, without exception. As are the most vulnerable young people who needed it, it will necessarily have an impact on graduation in Quebec. " 
Quebec already knows a major diploma problem, with 30% of young people who arrive at 20 years without any diploma. For Alexandre Cloutier, it is a national drama: "It's a ticket for poverty, for social exclusion, it is exactly the opposite of the type of society we want to give itself. If you do not have a best graduation rate in the world, you do not create jobs, you innovate less, you put your company at risk. " 
"That's why you have to react. The Blais minister must stop being the doorpet of his colleague Martin Coiteux at the Treasury Board and establish a real report of power with him. " 
To parents worried about the fate of their children's school, Alexander Cloutier asks them to continue relentlessly: "Mobilize yourself, get yourself heard, it is the approach of the dropper, but we will end up and reduce the government. " 
"On our side, we will continue to get up day after day at the National Assembly, as long as the Blais minister will not recoil."
