Quebec- The member for Berthier and the official opposition spokesman for agriculture, fisheries and food, André Villeneuve, denounces the information published in the media that responsible for food inspection. Remote region would be locked up in their offices from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Inspectors say they were orally informed of this "risk management policy" which force them to limit their exits to emergencies. 
"Liberal-Caquist austerity, we see the results in all regions of Quebec. Here, we sacrifice the inspection of food and restaurants. How to ensure food safety when we do not see them? It's total nonsense. The liberal government's compressions endanger the health and safety of Quebec consumers, "said André Villeneuve. 
Since joining the Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, has spoken a lot about the fact that he wants to make legislative changes, particularly with respect to feedback and animal welfare. Now, without the presence of inspectors on the ground, these possible modifications will have no effect. 
"The minister is always ready to change the law but, if he does not allow the inspectors to go on the ground to apply it, it is useless to modify it. Without the presence of inspectors to make the necessary verifications, the health and safety of Quebeckers remain at risk. With its technical changes, the minister gives himself the impression of acting, but for the population, the salubrity of the products is still not guaranteed. Ending people's health to meet the austere requests from his colleague Martin Clisseux, with the downstream of the Prime Minister, demonstrates a flagrant lack of minister Paradise, "the spokesman.
