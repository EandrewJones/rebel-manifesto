IN SHORT 
"It's an honor for me to file this petition. It's time to consider intimidation at school for what it really is: a major problem that has long-term impacts on the health and well-being of young people who undergo it. We then join the Partician's voice with personalities and organizations from all walks of life asking the government to act - Dr. Julien's Foundation, the Jasmin Roy Foundation, the organization together for respect for diversity, The Louis Emond Youth Author, the City of Saint-Bruno, the Association of Retirees and Retirees of Education and Other Public Services of Quebec and the Champlain Union, to name only those "," enumerated Diane Lamarre. 
"Intimidation and violence destroy lives. To the public, privately, wherever they are, children are entitled to safety and dignity. This is, in particular, what the Manifesto claims. It also advocates for regular outreach workshops in schools, for young people as well as for adults, as well as a real accountability of the aggressors. To work, however, these actions must be headed by the government; Because the only way to overcome intimidation and violence in schools is to attack all together, collectively. To make a "state affair", "said Carole Poirier.
