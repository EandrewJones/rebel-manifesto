Quebec, on October 24, 2016 -Selon the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in public health, prevention and healthy lifestyle, Sylvain Pagé, "the government policy of health prevention, which was made public yesterday, includes orientations and targets that are commendable. That said, we wonder about the means that will be available to reach them ". 
"Liberal austerity hit the public health sector hard, while the government proceeded to a recurring cut of $ 23.7 million in 2015-16. However, everything indicates that the reinvestment announced yesterday will not fill this shortfall, "said the spokesman. 
A question for Minister Charlebois "I have a question for the Minister delegated to Rehabilitation, the Protection of Youth, Public Health and Healthy Lifestyle: What proportion of the $ 76 million announced Sunday will be reinjected to course of this mandate of his Government? The minister must show transparency and tell us how much money will actually be invested in the short term because, this amount, it is planned for a period of 10 years ... ", Sylvain prosecuted. 
Since the completion of the Liberal government, the Parti Québécois has strongly denounced public health cuts, which includes prevention, vaccination, infectious disease surveillance, smoking prevention, early cancer screening, etc. "Investing in public health and prevention, it is paying in the long run. We will continue to highlight the government about it until it is obvious that it is time to act. Yesterday there were seven ministers on site for this ad. If the money is not at the rendezvous now, it will be necessary to conclude that the presence of all this beautiful world was only a staging to make the sad reality forget, "added Sylvain.
