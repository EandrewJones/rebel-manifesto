Quebec- The Prime Minister of Quebec, Pauline Marois, entrusts his parliamentary assistant for the youth and deputy records of Laval-des-Rapides, Leo Bureau-Blouin, the mandate to lead the work leading to the development of the new Youth Policy of Quebec. The deputies of Saint John, Dave Turcotte, and Terrebonne, Mathieu Traversy, will attend him in the realization of his mandate. 
"In 2030, Leo Bureau-Blouin will have 38 years. It is for young people of this age that we must rethink our youth policy. From tomorrow, the government undertakes a new participatory approach in the design of its public policies. In addition to a region tour, an innovative website will collect young people's reflections to define Quebec from 2030, "said Pauline Marois. 
At first, Leo Bureau-Blouin will lead a tour of all regions of Quebec to meet youth. Until September, the member for Laval-des-Rapides and his colleagues will perform this tour by pursuing three objectives: to raise awareness, mobilize and consult the young people and the people who are waiting for Quebec of 2030, so that they will argue their opinions, their priorities and their initiatives. 
To take into account the reality of young people, a brand new website is also launched today. This platform, inspired by web 2.0 interaction principles, has been developed by free software. It offers a new interactivity to maximize citizen participation. All young people in Quebec are invited to visit this site, to appropriate it and to leave their brand. 
The government will provide the conclusions of this consultation in a white paper that will be deposited in the fall. The fruit of regional consultation, virtual contributions and analyzes from departments and agencies will be the foundation of the next Quebec Youth Policy. The White Paper will be studied in parliamentary committee by the end of 2013.
