Quebec - The Quebec Prime Minister Pauline Marois, today launched the work of the next youth policy, along with his parliamentary assistant for the youth and MP files for Laval-des-Rapides, Leo Bureau-Blouin. From tomorrow, the government began a vast consultation exercise with Quebec youth to define Quebec from 2030. This is a single participatory approach that will be carried out in a very new way in the design of public policies. . 
"In the spring of 2012, young people have been talking about calling for changes in our society. Since September 4, we have restored dialogue with Quebec youth. We have restored social peace and ended the clashes. It is now imperative to provide us with mechanisms and ways to do so that political decision-makers are never cut off from the rising generation, "Pauline Marois said. 
Being listening to Quebec youth is a trademark of the governments of the Parti Québécois. In 1983, René Lévesque held the first Quebec youth summit, which allowed the creation of the secretariat to the youth and the Permanent Council of Youth. Then, in 2000, Lucien Bouchard invited young people to the summit of Quebec and youth. This exercise gave birth to the first Quebec youth policy and the creation of the Quebec Youth Fund.
