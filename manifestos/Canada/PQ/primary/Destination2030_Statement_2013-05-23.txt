As Minister responsible for youth, I launched today the work of the new Youth Policy of Quebec. As a result of a vast consultation exercise with Quebec youth in order to define Quebec from 2030. 
I entrusted to my parliamentary assistant to the youth and deputy records of Laval-des-Rapides, Leo Bureau-Blouin, the mandate to lead the work leading to this new policy. 
In 2030, Leo will have 38 years. It is for young people like him that we must think of this policy. We want to give our youth ways to take its place in Quebec tomorrow. 
To do this, we innovate. We launch a participatory approach, a very new way of designing our public policies. 
This consultation will be held thanks to a tour in all regions of Quebec, but also through a brand new citizen participation website, at leagues of all we have seen so far in our public institutions . It is a platform inspired by web 2.0 interaction principles, elaborated using free software. I invite all young people in Quebec to visit this site, to appropriate it and to leave their brand. 
In the spring of 2012, young people were speaking to call for change in our society. 
It is now imperative to equip us with mechanisms and ways of doing so that policy makers are never cut off from the rising generation. 
Today's youth live in a society different from the year 2000. Information technology has changed their relationship to the world and their way of participating in public dialogue. 
Our youth has the right to define its future. The context calls political actors to make decisions without thinking about the next election, but at the next generation. 
The confrontation and social crisis are behind us. Now place dialogue and participation. 
The destination is clear, it's the year 2030. The goal is also: it's a future for all!
