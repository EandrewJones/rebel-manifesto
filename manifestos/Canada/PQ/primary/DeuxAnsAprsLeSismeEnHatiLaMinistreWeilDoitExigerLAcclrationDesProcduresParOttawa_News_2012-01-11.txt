Québec- "Note two years after the earthquake that has devastated Haiti in January 2010, only half of the people that Quebec had to welcome under the program set up by the Liberal government have actually arrived in Quebec is totally inadmissible , even shocking. 
That said the hon. Member for Drummond and the official opposition to the immigration and cultural communities, Yves-François Blanchet, after learning that Quebec has awarded 5978 selection certificates in the part of its special humanitarian sponsorship program for Haiti. However, only half of the people selected under this specific program received their immigrant visa from Ottawa. 
"Minister Kathleen Weil must put his angelism aside and act. Affirm that the Ottawa delays are acceptable is revolting. His prime minister has made promises to the Haitian people two years ago, but she now says she does not hear everything so that this promise is held. It is shameful! "Banded the Blanchet deputy. 
According to him, it is very clear that the federal government has never had a serious will to simplify administrative procedures, even for obvious humanitarian reasons. "We have there once again, an eloquent demonstration that when Quebec will hold all the powers in terms of immigration, such situations will be avoided, because we will establish our own procedures without having to request the final authorization to a other nation. In the meantime, humanitarian motives, political recovery and the lack of respect for Ottawa to Quebec decisions leave thousands of Haitians suffer from misery and uncertainty. Minister Weil must achieve it quickly and act, "concluded Yves-François Blanchet.
