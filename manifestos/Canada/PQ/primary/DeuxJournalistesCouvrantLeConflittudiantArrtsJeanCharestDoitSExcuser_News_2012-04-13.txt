Quebec- The Quebec party urges the Prime Minister of Quebec, Jean Charest, to apologize for the police skid that took place this morning in Montreal, causing the imprisonment of two journalists of the daily La Presse. 
"The student conflict degenerates to a point such that the police now stop two duly accredited journalists who cover a demonstration. In which the world are we going to live such skid? Quebec is a democratic society where the exercise of the profession of journalist must be able to be in peace. Jean Charest must quickly apologize, "said the member for Chambly and sentence of the official opposition on public safety, Bertrand St-Arnaud. 
The member for Chambly expressed concern to see several police drifts in connection with the work of journalists lately. "The Cavalière attitude, a few weeks ago, at the Journalist Dujournal de Montréalqui did only his work is just as unacceptable. The Prime Minister and his Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, must quickly remind police authorities a number of basic democratic principles, "pursued Bertrand St-Arnaud. 
The Parti Québécois also denounces any gesture of violence and misdeed as demonstration. "The use of any form of violence to pass a message to the government and the elected officials is reprehensible. The current situation is surprised and the first responsible is the Liberal government. It is time for Jean Charest puts aside his pride and invites students to discuss in the calm around a work table since his minister of education, Line Beauchamp, lost all legitimacy and credibility, "concluded, for His share, the member for Taillon and the official opposition spokeswoman in higher education and loans and scholarships, Marie Malavoy.
