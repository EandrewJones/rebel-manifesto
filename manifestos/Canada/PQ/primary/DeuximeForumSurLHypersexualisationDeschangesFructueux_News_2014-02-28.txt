"The government is very sensitive to the issue of sexual stereotypes that undermine the achievement of equality between women and men.

Ultimately, what we want as government is that young Quebec people are better equipped to withstand the pressure of some reducing female models, "Ms Maltais said. 
The day was devoted to the study and description of the problem through presentations delivered by university researchers and speakers. Nearly 120 participants took part in the Quebec forum on Hypersexualization, including various national and regional organizations concerned by the problem. 
"It is important to find, in addition to the actions already carried out, other sustainable and innovative solutions; You have to get out of the beaten track to counter the hypersexualization. In this respect, it is imperative to question each other collectively so that our young girls grow into a framework that looks like us as a society, "said Proulx. 
Remember that in addition to the forum held today in Quebec City, the minister's parliamentary assistant held a first forum in Laval, January30. The hon. Member for Sainte-Rose will lead more forums, this spring, in Quebec. These days aim to enrich the actions already undertaken and to inspire new ones to act in the face of hypersexualization.
