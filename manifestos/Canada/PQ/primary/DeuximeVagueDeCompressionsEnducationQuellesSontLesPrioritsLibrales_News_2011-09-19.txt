Quebec - "It's outrageous! Exclaimed the member for Jonquière and the official opposition spokeswoman in primary and secondary education, Sylvain Gaudreault, in response to the announcement of a second wave of compressions in education. "On the one hand, the Liberal government closes its eyes on transportation costs that lose millions of dollars to Quebecers and the same Liberal government makes compressions in education. It's discouraging to see how this government manages its priorities, "continued the hon. Member. 
"How a government that has the pellet, after two years of insistant demands of the population, to continue to refuse to trigger a public inquiry commission which, in the long term, would save millions of dollars to Quebec. Can we afford to cut in the quality of the education of future generations? "Sorry the member for Taillon and the official opposition spokeswoman in higher education and loans and scholarships, Marie Malavoy. 
The member for Jonquière recalls that the Liberal government has already slaughtered $ 110 million in primary and secondary education, which has not been impossible for student services. "It's totally odious to put on the backs of cost overruns in transportation of new compressions in education while the Duchesau report states that these cost overruns are due to corruption and malpracture. If the Prime Minister agrees to play the ostrich by not even deigning to read the Duchesau Report, will he make the same with the consequences of education cuts, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
For its part, the member for Taillon denounced the new cuts in CEGEPs while the first wave of compressions had real consequences for student services. "Are we going to pay the invoice of malpractices in construction by cutting in education? Instead of weakening the neuralgic sector for the future of Quebec, the government should clean and trigger a public inquiry into the construction industry, "concluded Mary Malavoy.
