Québec- The member for Saint-Jérôme and the official opposition spokesman in the field of economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, as well as the member for Berthier and spokesperson Agriculture, André Villeneuve, deplore the financial difficulties of the Greenhouses of the St. Lawrence, a producer company of the Tomato Savoura, and ask the government to be in the vuits to safeguard the jobs. 
"Our thoughts are with the 200 St. Lawrence Serres workers who, with the financial difficulties of the company, are found today in uncertainty. The government must be at the rendezvous if ever support is necessary to maintain jobs. In addition, in the context where a new buyer is required, it is desirable that the interests of the company remain in the hands of Quebec entrepreneurs, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"In a perspective of food sovereignty and local purchase, the government of the Parti Québécois had put in place a measure to reduce the energy cost of greenhouses, offering them a lower electricity rate. We must do everything to preserve this expertise at home and to offer Quebec consumers of products here, "concluded André Villeneuve.
