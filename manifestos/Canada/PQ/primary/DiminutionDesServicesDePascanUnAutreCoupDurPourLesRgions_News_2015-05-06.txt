Quebec- The member for Vachon and the official opposition spokesman, Martine Ouellet, and the members of the Eastern Quebec Party, Lorraine Richard (Duplessis), Marjolan Dufour (René-Lévesque), Pascal Bérubé (Matane-Matapédia), Sylvain Roy (Bonaventure) and Gaétan Lelièvre (Gaspé), deplored the decrease in services offered by the Pascan air carrier, and ask the Liberal government to intervene to avoid the isolation of our regions. 
"The Pascan company significantly reduces its services. In fact, it cuts them by half in Gaspésie, in Bonaventure, the Madeleine Islands and on the North Shore, not to mention that it ceases its activities in Gatineau and Havre-Saint-Pierre. However, transportation is a primordial element for the socio-economic development of our regions, already undermined by liberal policies. As a result, we are asking the government to study the opportunities for intervention to prevent it from worsening isolation in Eastern Quebec, "said Martine Ouellet. 
"Access to our regions is an essential aspect of the occupation of our territory. Our fellow citizens, who must already deal with a decrease in transit and rail services, are all the more worried. For our economy and social development, we affirm our solidarity to the population and ask the government to listen to ", have concluded members of the Eastern Quebec Party.
