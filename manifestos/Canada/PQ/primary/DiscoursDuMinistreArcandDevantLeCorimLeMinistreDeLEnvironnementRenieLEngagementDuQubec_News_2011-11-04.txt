Quebec -The MP for the Assumption and Spokesperson for the Official Opposition on the Environment, Sustainable Development and Parks, Scott McKay, is not impressed with the remarks now by the Minister of Sustainable Development, The environment and parks, Pierre Arcand, concerning the fight for climate change and greenhouse gases of his government. 
"When the minister talks about the target of -6% compared to 1990 as the target of Quebec, he denies Quebec's commitment. He denied the commitments made by his own government to reach the targets covered by the Kyoto Protocol, "says Scott McKay, who attended the Minister's discourse this noon before the Montreal International Relations Board. 
"The minister neglects that the result of -2.5% of GHG emissions for 2009 compared to 1990 is due to the economic recession and closures in the pulp and paper sector. He also fails to say that road transport constantly grows the assessment of GHG emissions from Québec because of lack of real measures to reduce emissions in this sector, "said Scott McKay. 
"Nothing more about the federal government that plumbs that of Quebec year after year. Canada's lack of effort in the fight against climate change throws a shadow on Quebec and is cantilevered at the international level, "said the member for the Assumption. 
"Mr. Arcand's speech has significant omissions. As always, the Liberal government tries to lacquer its image under beautiful environmental principles. Behind the words, there is little concrete! The Liberals are reaffiring again the champions of the eco-blanching! ", Concluded the spokesman for the Parti Québécois.
