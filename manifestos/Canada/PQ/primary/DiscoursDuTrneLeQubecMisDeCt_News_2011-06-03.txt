Quebec - the member for Marie-Victorin and official opposition on Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Bernard Drainville, noted this afternoon that the Harper Government will not only ignore Quebec's demands in the future, But that in addition, he will do exactly the opposite of what Quebeckers want. 
"The message in the throne speech is clear: now, Quebec does not count anymore. Stephen Harper, now majority, leaves no doubt as to the importance he gives to Quebec opinion. For him, Quebec is at the last level of its priorities and it will be reflected by the unconstitutional reform of the Senate without the consent of Quebec and a significant reduction in Quebec's weight in the House of Commons, "said Bernard Drainville. 
"The Speech from the Throne has several examples where Quebeckers' values oppose those of the Conservative government. Quebeckers have always been in favor of maintaining the gun registry and the Canadian government is about to abolish it. A strong consensus exists in Quebec against the creation of a Canadian Securities Commission, but Stephen Harper goes from the front anyway. Quebec refuses a federal aid to Newfoundland for the Bas-Churchill Hydroelectric Project and the Conservatives announce that they will go forward even if it creates unfair competition in Hydro-Qu√©bec. The model of "the law and order" to the American is miles from Quebec values, but it is more than ever the doctrine of the federal level, "summed up the hon. Member. 
"The majority government of Stephen Harper makes us realize more than ever that an independent Quebec would have the freedom to choose its priorities according to its values rather than being imposed by the government of another nation," concluded Bernard Drainville.
