Trois-Rivières- The leader of the Quebecois, Pauline Marois, today announced the candidacy of Djemila Benhabib in the riding of Trois-Rivières. 
"Djemila is an exceptional woman who chose Quebec because it is a land of reception, freedom and equality. It is a brave activist who does not know the tongue of wood and does not fear rising to the barricades. A woman of a great sensitivity who will become a passionate member, listening to her fellow citizens. Djemila Benhabib joins us because she shares our vision of Quebec values, "said Pauline Marois. 
"If I join the Parti Québécois team today, it is first and foremost because it is the only party that is not afraid to affirm and defend Quebec values. The secularism of institutions, equality between women and men and respect for Quebec identity are important issues for me and I will have them proud to the citizens of Trois-Rivières, "exclaimed Djemila Benhabib . 
Pauline Marois wanted to remember that the Parti Québécois believed in a Quebec proud of its values, language, traditions and equality between women and men. "We appreciate the diversity that enriches Quebec, but we reject Canadian multiculturalism. For us, the integration of cultural communities into Quebec society is paramount and multiculturalism is a major obstacle to harmonious integration, "said the leader of the Quebecois party. 
"I am confident that the citizens of Mauricie and Trois-Rivières will make the choice of a Quebec who stands up and is not afraid to affirm his values," concluded Pauline Marois, recalling that the party Québécois is the largest political training in Quebec with its 90,000 members.
