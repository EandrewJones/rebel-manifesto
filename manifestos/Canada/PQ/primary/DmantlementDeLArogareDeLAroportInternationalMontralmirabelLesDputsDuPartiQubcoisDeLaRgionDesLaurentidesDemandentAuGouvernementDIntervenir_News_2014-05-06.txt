Quebec- As a result of the announcement of the next dismantling of the Montreal-Mirabel International Airport, the members of the Quebecois Party of the Laurentian Region, Sylvain Pagé, Pierre Karl Péladeau and Claude Cousineau, are intended to ensure their support for the population of Mirabel and the entire region. They launch a call to the government to immediately intervene on this issue. 
"The government must respond to the ongoing mobilization in the Laurentians and throughout the Greater Montreal area. The terminal represents a major development potential; We support the population and elected officials so that it is possible to avoid its demolition, "said the member for Labelle, Sylvain Pagé. 
The call for mobilization launched by the Mayor of Mirabel, Mr. Jean Bouchard, was understood by the elected representatives of the Regional Conference of the elected representatives of the Laurentians and the Metropolitan Community of Montreal. All agree to work together to find solutions. 
MPs also ask the Government to participate in the definition of a new terminal vocation, with an area of 500,000 square feet, unoccupied since 2004. 
"The government can not remain inactive in this case. Mirabel Airport is a hub for the Aerospace sector in Quebec. His terminal may be at the heart of the continuation of development and revitalization, provided he finds a new vocation, "said the member for Bertrand, Claude Cousineau. 
"The community and elected municipal officials know that they can count on our collaboration to find an innovative and structuring project, for the benefit of the entire population. Before proceeding with dismantling, it is necessary to give the time necessary to analyze all the possibilities, as demands all the stakeholders, "concluded the hon. Member for Saint? Jérôme, Pierre Karl Péladeau.
