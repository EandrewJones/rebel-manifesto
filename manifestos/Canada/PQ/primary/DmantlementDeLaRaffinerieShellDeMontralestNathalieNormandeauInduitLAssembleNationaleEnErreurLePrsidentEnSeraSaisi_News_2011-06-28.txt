Montreal -The MP from Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for the metropolis, Nicole LÃ©ger, sent this afternoon a letter denouncing a violation of rights and privileges to the President of the National Assembly , Mr. Jacques Chagnon. 
At least three times during the question period during the last year, Minister Normandeau stated, hand on the heart, that it would not emit a dismantling permit of the Montreal-East Shell refinery before the deposit of the Report arising from the initiative mandate of the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries, Energy and Natural Resources on Supply Safety in Petroleum Products. 
"The minister has repeated that she would never fail to respect the work of parliamentarians and that she would never make a decision or issuing a dismantling permit before the end of the mandate. However, the work is not completed, the members of the Commission did not submit their report and the minister acts now by doing exactly the opposite of what she had said. There is a breach of a parliamentarian's ethics, "said light nicole discontent. 
"The attitude of Nathalie Normandeau is unworthy of his duties, added the member. A minister can not affirm one thing and do exactly the opposite as soon as the parliamentary session ends. The attitude of the minister turns the House and the work of its members in ridiculous and violates the rights of its members, as previously recognized by the case law. 
"The President has before him all the elements to make an informed decision. The minister must change attitude and respect institutions, "concluded the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles.
