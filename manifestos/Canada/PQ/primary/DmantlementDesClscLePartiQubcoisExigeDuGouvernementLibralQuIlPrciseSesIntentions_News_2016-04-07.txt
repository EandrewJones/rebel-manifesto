Québec- The member for Taillon and spokesman for the Quebecois health and accessibility of care, Diane Lamarre, questioned the Minister's approach to the transfer of CLSC professionals to the GMF. 
In the presence of the President of the Order of Social Workers and the Conjugal and Family Therapists of Quebec, Claude Leblond, the President of the Alliance of Professional and Technical Personnel for Health and Social Services, Carolle Dubé, and the President From Quebec doctors for the public scheme, Isabelle Leblanc, Ms. Lamarre denounced the absence of the Minister's plan and his lack of transparency, in what is similar to a dismantling of CLSCs. 
"The first question is: Why not add professionals rather than strip the CLSCs of their human resources? It was, however, anywhere in the Liberal Party's commitments that CLSC dismantling would be made. While the minister himself said that GMF took care of the curative, it is necessary to worry that this reform translates into a decline in prevention, as well as in terms of the effectiveness of the follow-up. Performed with complex patients, having both physical, psychosocial and mental health problems, which are currently often found in CLSC. In addition, it is difficult not to see another desire from the minister to centralize the organization of care around doctors, "said the member. 
"Several questions remain unanswered and arouses strong concerns about the ground: what will happen to patients who are currently being followed in CLSC? What will become the mission of the CLSC, if we are moving all the professionals who work there? What autonomy will enjoy non-GMF professionals? The true interprofessional collaboration can not be done in a context where the doctor is in the position of authority compared to other professionals, as is the case currently with specialized nurse practitioners. The minister must now specify his intentions and present a clear plan, "concluded Diane Lamarre.
