Quebec- The member for Verchères and the official opposition spokesperson for ethics and integrity, Stéphane Bergeron, and the member for Taillon and spokesperson for health and accessibility to care, Diane Lamarre Asking the Minister of Health to be explained in the resignation of the Director General Ducentre Hospital of the Université de Montréal (CHUM), Jacques Turgeon. 
"The Minister is accused of having shown political interference and abuse of power by imposing his choice for the appointment of the Chum Surgery Director, who would be a good friend to him. It is a serious, very serious accusation, to which is added an appearance of conflict of interest, "said Stéphane Bergeron. 
"The minister held a press point this afternoon to justify the resignation of the Choan Director of the Chum and clenching anyone with this story. Why is it the minister, not the Chum, who announced this news this morning? What message does this send to the health network, currently in full blocking because of the reform imposed by the minister and, above all, at the heart of a process of appointing his CEOs? The minister must be explained on the actions he posed and on his ties with the chief of Chum surgery, "concluded Diane Lamarre.
