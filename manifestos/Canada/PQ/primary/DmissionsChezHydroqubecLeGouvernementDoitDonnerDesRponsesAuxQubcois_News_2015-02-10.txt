Quebec- The member for Marie-Victorin and the official opposition on energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, demanded by the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Pierre Arcand, responses as to the Numerous resignations at Hydro-Québec. 
"This can no longer be coincidences. Numbers 1 and 2 of the Crown corporation resigned, just like the Intelligent Counters Manager. Today we are learned that one of the oldest members of the Board of Directors, Michel Plessis-Bélair, also left office in nebulous circumstances. Minister Pierre Arcand must be transparent with Quebeckers. What happens at Hydro-Québec? Did these people refuse to blindly follow the new government orientations? Is it related to the privatization proposed in the Montaguquette report? We stop talking to us about coincidences; There is no one who believes that this situation is due to chance. The minister must give answers, "said Bernard Drainville. 
In 10 years, 27 internal investigations 
"In the study of budget appropriations, last June, I asked the Minister if there had been internal investigations on the granting of Hydro-Québec's contracts. In September 2014, we had the answer: since 2005, there were 27 internal investigations on contracts granted by Hydro-Québec. What contracts have these investigations worn? Which shipyards? Which companies? For what if presumed irregularities? We do not know. Hydro-Québec refused to unveil the content of the reports, "added the spokesman. 
Bernard Drainville also arrested Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, who said last week that everything was well and that departures were normal in a big society. "Unlike the Prime Minister, we do not believe it's banal. Quebeckers want explanations. Hydro-Québec belongs to them. The resigning must be heard in parliamentary committee; We want to know their version of the facts, "he concluded.
