Quebec- The member for Labelle, Sylvain Pagé, denounces the total abandonment of the Liberal government and the Minister responsible for the Laurentian region, Pierre Arcand, in the Mirabel Air File. He also held a press briefing this morning in the company of the member for Mirabel, Sylvie d'Amours, and the Mayor of Mirabel, Jean Bouchard. 
"In response to my questions, Minister Arcand has fully despised the regional consensus requesting an additional three-month period at Montreal Aéroports (ADM) before proceeding with the destruction of the terminal. The elected officials, the Creé and the metropolitan community of Montreal are unanimous on this subject. The Liberals confirm today that they abandon the citizens of the Laurentians, "said Sylvain Pagé. 
The idea of converting the abandoned terminal into the center of fairs represents a major economic project and, according to the preliminary business plan, the region has the potential to ensure sustainability. The partners are to set up a proposal to reuse the facilities of the terminal; A management company has been formed, projects are in the cartons, but it takes a little time. 
"Despite unacceptable decisions and human dramas caused by Mirabel's horror history, people in the region look to the future with resilience and courage. The three-month period would allow Mirabel to study the viability of the Fair Center project. However, the government sweeps the regional approach to the reverse of the hand; It is incomprehensible and unacceptable, "concluded Sylvain Pagé.
