Longueuil, July 23, 2014 - The member for Taillon and sentence of the official objection to health and accessibility to care, Diane Lamarre, wanted to invite the public to participate in the mobilization orchestrated by May Duong on Donates of stem cells. She thanked all those who responded to the call, while recalling that a compatible donor has not yet been found. 
"While in a full year ,,,500 people are part of the stem cell donor registry, Ms. Dong's action managed to do that Hema-Qu√©bec obtains, in about twenty days, only 1637 inscriptions. Of which 50% came from people of Asian origin, compared to 0.5% until now. As always, Quebeckers have shown great generosity, but we need to continue the mobilization, "said Diane Lamarre. 
Global donor banks are not diversified enough. Most registrants are mostly Caucasian origin. It is a different reality for several other ethnic origins, such as Asians, Hispanics or the Black Communities, which are submitted there. The action of May Duong therefore brings an invaluable contribution, even in the beyond Quebec. 
"There are three ways to give stem cells. It can be done by bone marrow puncture, by the gift of umbilical cord in some hospital centers or by apheresis. This is a technique that, after stimulating the donor the production of stem cells by a drug, allows their recovery, "continued the member for Taillon 
"May Duong's approach touched all Quebeckers. In the tumult of work days, some may have pushed back to register. The holiday period is a perfect opportunity to appreciate the chance to be healthy and take a few minutes that will save a life. This will also improve access to specialized care. This is another way to help patients from here and elsewhere to increase their chances of survival, by a more complete bank of potential donors, "concluded Diane Lamarre, while insisting that he is simple to register at the registry by going to the siteheme-quebec.qc.ca.
