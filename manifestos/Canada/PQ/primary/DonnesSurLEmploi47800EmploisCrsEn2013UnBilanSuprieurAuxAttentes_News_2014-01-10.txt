Québec- The latest job data, published this morning by Statistics Canada, show a positive assessment in Quebec in 2013 compared to 2012. 
"The December data make it possible to obtain the global portrait for the year that has just ended. It can therefore be seen that it was created on average 47,800 jobs in 2013, a slightly higher level of our forecasts. This is a good news since 2013 was a better year than 2012 in terms of job creation, while it had created 30,800 jobs. Remember that the last budget of the Liberal government provided for a creation of 35,700 jobs for 2013 when in reality, it was created 12,100 jobs more than ex-minister Raymond Bachand, "said the Minister of Finance And the economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau. 
"Note that the level of employment thus reaches an annual peak ever reached historically with 4,032,200 people at work for the year. For its part, the annual unemployment rate fell by 0.2 percentage point to 7.6%. In addition, the annual employment rate (60.3%) in Quebec has been at its highest level since 2008. Also, the employment rate of people aged 15 to 64 (72.2%) has reached a New annual peak unparalleled since 1976, "said the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Ms. Agnès Maltais. 
There is a confidence of the Quebec population to be employed as the labor force increased by 12,100 people in December 2013, despite a difficult economic situation at the Canadian level. As for the unemployment rate, it displayed 7.7%, an increase of 0.5 percentage points primarily due to the rise in the labor force. 
The Ministry of Employment and Social Solidarity, through Emploi-Québec, acts both as a producer, user and national and regional data broadcaster in the labor market. In particular, it produces the Labor Market Bulletin in Quebec, which reports monthly of the evolution of employment, the labor force and unemployment in addition to identifying information by region, by sector of activity and by profession, as well as comparisons with Canada and Ontario. This will be available at the end of the day on the website of Employment-Québec at the following address: www.emploicbec.gouv.qc.ca/imt/emploi-au-quebec.asp.
