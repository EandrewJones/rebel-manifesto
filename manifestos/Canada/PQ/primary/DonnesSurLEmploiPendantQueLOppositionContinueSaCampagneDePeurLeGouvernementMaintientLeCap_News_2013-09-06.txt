Quebec- "As opposition parties continue to try to scare Quebeckers, the facts are stubborn: never under a liberal government there were as many Quebeckers in the labor market and today. This is what the Minister of Finance and the Economy said, Mr. Nicolas Marceau. 
The employment data published today by Statistics Canada show that the monthly unemployment rate has decreased by 0.3 percentage points, to be 7.9% in August. In addition, employment in Quebec has changed (5,000 jobs in August compared to the previous month). It has been created 21,200 new full-time jobs in Quebec in August. Also, during the first eight months of 2013, employment is up 62,200 jobs compared to the same period in 2012. Since the beginning of the year, employment growth in Quebec (1.6 %) is similar to that of the United States and is greater than that of Ontario (1.5%) and Canada (1.4%). 
GDP by industry for the first five months of 2013 is 1.4% higher than the same period of the previous year. Retail sales (+ 0.4%), salaries and salaries (+ 0.6%) and exports (+ 5.4%) increased in the second quarter of 2013. In addition, the latest economic indicators, including international commodity exports (+ 6.4% in June) and housing starts (+ 1.1% in July) continue to grow. 
Despite global uncertainties, Quebec's economy continues to grow in 2013. It will take advantage of the acceleration of the resumption of the US economy and the important investments announced or in progress in Quebec. 
"As expected, private investment is at the rendezvous. Danone's $ 40 million investments in Boucherville and $ 16.3 million from Servier Canada in Laval announced today are tangible evidence, "said the minister. 
"Since our arrival we have to do what the Liberals have never succeeded in nine years: we control the expenses of the state. With preliminary results of a growth of 1.7% in 2012-2013 and a forecast of 1.9% for this year, Quebec is in good posture for the future. The current situation allows the government to keep the balance on a balanced budget while stimulating job creation, "concluded Nicolas Marceau.  The minister will follow the situation in his economic and financial update of the fall.
