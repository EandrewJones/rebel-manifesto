Quebec- The member for Sanguinet and official opposition spokesperson for pension plans, Alain Therrien, responded to the publication of the numbers concerning the deficit of the municipal employees pension plans, which reveal that the government has overestimated The magnitude of the deficit to impose its bill for Quebec workers and retirees. 
"The manipulation of the numbers to achieve their ends is a way of making Liberals since their arrival in power. At that time, the government inflated the numbers of the Quebec deficit to justify its austerity policy; The Minister of Health admitted that he encouraged doctors specialists to falsify the results of surveys; Today, it is learned that Minister Pierre Moreau has inflated the figures on the deficit of municipal employees' pension plans, "said Alain Therien. 
The member recalled that he had filed a motion on September 18 months asking for the updated figures of pension plans. The Liberal government and the CAQ voted against it. "We wanted to have the portrait just to apply the adequate remedy. The minister, for his part, ensured that the true figures are not unveiled before the passage of the bill. Stakeholders and experts heard in parliamentary committee said the situation was improving. The minister has hidden reality; He made a sprain in the democratic process to apply his solution, regardless of the reality of workers and retirees, "concluded Alain Therien.
