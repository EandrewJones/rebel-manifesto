"We have worked with this family so that, at least, children can finish their school year before having to leave the country. Unfortunately, the federal government has shown no flexibility, "said the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. 
For its part, the member for Deux-Montagnes and Immigration Spokesperson, Benoit Charette, asks Minister Weil to ensure that his federal vis-Ã -vis the file of the Castillo family is revised . "Minister Weil must take a tight follow-up on that file so that this family, already well integrated into Quebec life, can return to Quebec as soon as possible," said the spokesperson for immigration. 
"The Castillo family left Quebec today with the firm intention to come back. The staff of my constituency office handed over to the family members all the necessary documents to fulfill a request for a certificate of selection of Quebec, which they must do up to the facility in Mexico in a place which, hopefully. The, will be sure for them. They will confirm the time of the filing of their request so that we can follow up with the ministry of Ms. Weil. We hope that this file will be treated with the largest diligence, "concluded Carole Poirier.
