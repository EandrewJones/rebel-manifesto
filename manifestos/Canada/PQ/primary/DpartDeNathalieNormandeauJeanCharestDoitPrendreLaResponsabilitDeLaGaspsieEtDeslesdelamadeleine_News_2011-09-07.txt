The member for Matane recalls that, under the leadership of the Quebec party, it was the Prime Minister of Quebec, which held the chairmanship of the Governmental Stimaries Committee and that Pauline Marois has made a commitment, in the 2008 election. to occupy the position of minister responsible for the region. 
Moreover, between 2007 and 2008, Jean Charest took responsibility as Minister responsible for the Capitale National. "If it's good for the Quebec City region, why would it not be good for Gaspésie? It is a gesture more than symbolic: our region always requires special attention from the government authorities and, in the current state of affairs, there is only the Prime Minister who can live up to regional expectations ", Concluded Pascal Bérubé.
