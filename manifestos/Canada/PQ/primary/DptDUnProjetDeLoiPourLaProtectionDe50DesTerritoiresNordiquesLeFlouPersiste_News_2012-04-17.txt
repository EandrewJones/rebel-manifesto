Qu√©bec- reacting to the filing of Bill 65 on the conservation of natural heritage and the sustainable development of the territory of the Northern Marketing Plan, the member for the Assumption and Spokesman for the Official Opposition on the Environment, Sustainable development and parks, Scott McKay believes that this is a cosmetic environmental protection. In addition, this bill maintains the blur on the real benefits and consequences. 
"Once again, the Liberal government has created enormous expectations that breaks down gradually. It is sorry for the bill to maintain blur and fuels confusion about the actual environmental protection intentions projected by the Northern Marketing Plan, "said Scott McKay. 
The member notes that the bill does not correct the lack of significant commitments for the environmental protection of the Nordic territories in the last budget presented a few weeks ago. 
"The conservation and protection of the Nordic territories are needed and desired, but still need to have the means and involve the Nordic communities who live and live in the territory. These communities are the best tools to work actively with the protection of 50% of their living environment. The current process is abstracted from their expertise, "concluded Scott McKay.
