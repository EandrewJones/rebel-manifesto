Quebec- The member for Rousseau and the official opposition spokeswoman in the field of finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, has tabled today a petition signed by more than 46,000 Quebeckers who ask, as part of the bill. 28, that pharmacists retain the resources needed to maintain the services they offer. 
"The government has decided to cut into direct services to patients. However, pharmacists are among the most accessible health professionals; Their institutions are open every day, and often until late at night. The government must listen to what pharmacists have to propose and not impose measures through his bill "Little Mammoth", "said Nicolas Marceau. 
Bill 28 also reduces the funds granted by the government to pharmacists for a significant measure of home maintenance: the preparation of pills. This service benefits especially elders, people already vulnerable who want to stay as long as possible at home. To do this, pills are essential tools. 
"The day before the filing of the bill, the government still negotiates with pharmacists. It's not playful playing than short-circuit the process as quickly. The government has "bulldoz√©" negotiations by imposing its cuts and working conditions of pharmacists in Budget Bill 28. This way of functioning is worthy of the Conservatives in Ottawa; It's certainly not a pride, "added the member for Rousseau. 
"Today, we file a petition of more than 46,000 names; I hope the government will hear these Quebeckers, and that it will negotiate in good faith with pharmacists, instead of imposing conditions. Our goal remains to ensure the best possible access for citizens to health services, "concluded Nicolas Marceau.
