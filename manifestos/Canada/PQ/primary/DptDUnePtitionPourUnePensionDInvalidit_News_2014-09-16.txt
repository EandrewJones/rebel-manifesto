Quebec- The member for Rimouski and official opposition spokesperson for poverty, solidarity and social economy, Harold Lebel, has tabled today to the National Assembly a petition of the collective for a disability pension. The manager and founder of the collective, Mrs. Carole St-Laurent, says proud of the 7123 electronic signatures and some 1000 paper signatures obtained in favor of the granting of a disability pension for all people truly unfit for use. . 
According to St. Lawrence, the current system, in place for more than forty years, is no longer appropriate; People receiving benefits are deprived of any chance of improving their condition. "The rules in force do not allow us to live in a relationship, to hold more than $ 1500 in savings or saving for our old days without being cut off," she mentions. 
In the eyes of the member for Rimouski, Harold Lebel, it is necessary to correct this situation that deprives these persons of rights possessed by all the other citizens of Quebec. "Their condition of incapacity at work is real and permanent. It's already, in itself, a difficult situation. Should we stop them from making choices that would allow them to improve their condition and think of their future? The current system pushes them towards isolation; It's totally absurd and unfair, "he said. 
According to the deputy, this is a blatant case of social exclusion. "In 2004, the government passed a law to combat poverty and social exclusion. Obviously, the targets we set ourselves ten years ago are not all reached. We should review this law, take stock of, define new goals and continue to work for the good of all, "Harold Lebel concluded.
