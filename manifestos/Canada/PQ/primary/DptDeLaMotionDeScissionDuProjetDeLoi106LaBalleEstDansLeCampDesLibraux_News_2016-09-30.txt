Quebec, September 29, 2016 -The member for Sanguinet and spokesperson for the Parti Energy and Natural Resources Party, Alain Therrien, asks the Prime Minister to return to his decision, and the Liberal government to consider the result Public consultations and to accept the motion to split Bill 106 that he filed this afternoon at the National Assembly. "We talk a lot about social acceptability in the hydrocarbon file. Well, our emission motion has, this social acceptability, "he said. 
"The hydrocarbon chapter contained in Bill 106 has generated only concerns; The government must hear right and remove it. The heart of Bill 106 is the transition from Quebec to clean energies. It is therefore entirely contradictory to include a hydrocarbon law miniproject! It is essential to separate the two stakes. The issue of hydrocarbons is particularly complex and deserves a debate in itself, "then insisted the member for Sanguinet. 
"The debate on Bill 106 will resume next Tuesday. So I tend the hand to the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Pierre Arcand: if he convinced his Prime Minister to accept the split, we will be able to progress quickly with the first chapters directly concerning the energy transition, an issue that consensus in Quebec. With regard to hydrocarbons, the minister must listen to Quebecers' concerns, and accept our proposal, which collects many stakeholders from agricultural, environmental, legal and municipal circles, as well as that of the other two opposition parties. "Concluded Alain Therrien.
