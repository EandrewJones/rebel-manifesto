Quebec- The Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau, today announced that he will table the 2013-2014 budget on November 20 at 4 pm. 
"The filing of a budget this fall is necessary in order to implement the provisions which will enable us to meet our commitment to return to a balanced budget in 2013-2014. Since the government's training, we have found that the magnitude of the recovery we need to do for requires us to act quickly. Waiting in the spring of 2013 would only delay the identification and implementation of the actions that are necessary to put Quebec on the path of fiscal balance for next year, "the minister explained. 
The minister also indicated that beyond the $ 1.6 billion in the order of $ 1.6 billion already identified in 2012-2013, several decisions made by the former government have the effect of putting significant pressure on the public finances. 
"We have seen significant cost overruns in several infrastructure projects and the extension of expensive measures in a difficult fiscal context. In addition, the use by the former compensation government of $ 2.2 billion for the harmonization of sales taxes to fill the deficit without the identification of recurring gestures for the maintenance of The fiscal balance, has proved to be a particularly poorly informed choice in the circumstances since it remains an additional gap of $ 875 million that will have to be resorbed in less than two years, "said the minister. 
"Despite the difficult situation we face, I want to reiterate the government's commitment to restoring fiscal balance from next year. Delaying this deadline would have important consequences for the finances and the economy of Quebec. We will protect Quebec's interest by taking our responsibilities and achieving budget balance, "the minister concluded. 
Media representatives will be invited to participate in an information session in camera to read the budget. The details of this invitation will be transmitted soon.
