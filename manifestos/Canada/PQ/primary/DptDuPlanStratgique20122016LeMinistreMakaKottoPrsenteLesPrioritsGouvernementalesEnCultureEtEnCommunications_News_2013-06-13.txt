Quebec- The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, is pleased to announce the deposit of the Department of Culture and Communications Strategic Plan 2012-2016 to the National Assembly. 
"This strategic plan clearly demonstrates the Government of Quebec's willingness to fully assume its skills in culture and support the influence of Quebec creativity with us and beyond our borders. Because culture defines us as people, it is essential to create favorable conditions for the development of a strong cultural footprint for Quebec, "said Minister Kotto. 
The Government of Quebec states in this respect its willingness to be the master of the development of its culture by negotiating the repatriation of the cultural budgets of the federal government, with the priority given to creation, production and dissemination , through the discount work of the 1992 cultural policy as well as the development of a strategy affecting digital cultural content. 
In addition, the ministry contributes to the maintenance of local services in culture and communications for citizens across all regions of Quebec. To do this, the department proposes to intensify the actions to bring young people and culture closer, optimize local and regional partnerships and promote access to the greatest number to culture and dissemination. In addition, the Department intends to deploy all necessary efforts to ensure the influence of Quebec culture internationally. 
To meet all these challenges, the Department works with a significant number of clients and diversified partners with whom he has close and essential links.
