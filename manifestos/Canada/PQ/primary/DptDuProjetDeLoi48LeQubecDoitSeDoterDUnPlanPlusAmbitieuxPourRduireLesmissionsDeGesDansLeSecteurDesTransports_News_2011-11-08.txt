Québec -The MP for the Assumption and Spokesperson for the Official Opposition on the Environment, Sustainable Development and Parks, Scott McKay, welcomes with interest and skepticism the filing of Bill 48 concerning environmental inspection Motor vehicles. 
"We have been calling for it for a long time and we reiterated it again at our congress last April; Quebec must have an ambitious plan to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector. With a 30% increase between 1990 and 2008, gestures need to be asked. Only this bill will be insufficient. You have to go further, "said the member for the Assumption. 
Scott McKay recalls that the Parti Québécois has sketched an ambitious plan to accelerate the achievement of significant reduction targets for Quebec by proposing in particular to develop centers of excellence in the advanced transportation sector, by electrifying Public and commercial fleets of vehicles and promoting, with massive investments, collective transport systems. 
"Bill 48 is a step in the right direction, but we invite the Liberal government to be bolder and we intend to take this opportunity for Quebec to take a step further. This is all the more important with the aberrant, scandalous and unacceptable decision of the Harper government to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol. In doing so, Quebec also comes to withdraw, always dependent on federal decisions, "said the member for the Assumption. 
"In addition, we must question the moment when the government has chosen the bill of the bill, or a few hours from the end of the work of the parliamentary session. It masks especially the government's inertia for the reduction of emissions in the transport sector, "concluded Scott McKay.
