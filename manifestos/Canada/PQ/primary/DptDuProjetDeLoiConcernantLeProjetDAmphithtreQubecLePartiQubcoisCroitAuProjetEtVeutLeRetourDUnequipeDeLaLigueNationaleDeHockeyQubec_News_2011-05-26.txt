Quebec - Member for Taschereau and official opposition spokesman for the Capitale-Nationale, Agnès Maltais, said today to the National Assembly at the request of the Mayor of Quebec City, Mr. Regis Labeaume , the private bill 204 concerning the multifunctional amphitheater project in Quebec. 
This bill recognizes the particular nature of the approach undertaken by the City of Quebec for the management of the future amphitheater. However, according to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, Regions and the occupation of the territory, this approach, according to the case law, could be considered as a competition and therefore, respect the spirit of the law. 
"The City of Quebec wishes to protect and secure its agreement with Quebecor, after seeking other offers. It's a just right decision. Thus, by this bill, we want to go further and put all the chances on our side for the return of a team from the National Hockey League (NHL) to Quebec City. Those who would like to challenge the agreement will need to know that it will rely on even stronger legal sites, "said Agnès Maltais. 
The member for Taschereau now wants the debate to be serenity and where it is relevant to do so at this point, in Parliamentary Committee. "Persons wishing to be heard can be and the parliamentarians and the public can then be an informed opinion," she continued. 
"Do not lose sight of the essentials: we must unite our efforts to realize the dream of several citizens of Quebec and Quebec, the return of a NHLP team to Quebec. This is our most expensive wish. Anyone who opposes the adoption of this bill may curb the realization of this dream, "said Agnès Maltese.
