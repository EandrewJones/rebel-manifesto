Quebec- The Quebec Party spokesperson in education, research and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, proposes to extend the powers of the Auditor General (VG) to all universities in Quebec, to put End to waste public funds in the network of higher education. 
This morning, the member for Lac-Saint-Jean filed Bill 590 at the National Assembly, which extends the powers of the VG to "chartered" universities. Currently, only the institutions of the Network of the University of Quebec (UQ) are subject to it. 
"The scandals of mismanagement public funds have accumulated for years. It's time to end the bar open in our universities. The Quebec state pays more than $ 2 billion a year to so-called "Charter" universities. No other entity receiving such sums of the state escapes VG checks. Nothing justifies the current differentiated treatment between UQ institutions and other universities, "mentioned Alexander Cloutier. 
The recent revelations of the Auditor General, that hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses have been paid illegally to institutional frameworks of the University of Quebec, testify to the importance of an independent look at the administration. Universities, according to the Parti Québécois. 
"More than $ 1.2 million from the taxpayers' pocket have been paid illegally in only 5 institutions. The government must recover these money and ensure that the state of the situation can be known in other universities. While our Higher Education Network suffers from underfunding, one must give themselves every means to prevent such significant amounts thus expanded without the knowledge of the population, "added Alexandre Cloutier.
