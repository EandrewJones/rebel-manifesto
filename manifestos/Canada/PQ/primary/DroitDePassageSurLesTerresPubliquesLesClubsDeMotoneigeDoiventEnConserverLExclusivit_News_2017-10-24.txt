Quebec, October 24, 2017 -The official opposition spokesperson for forest, wildlife and parks, Sylvain Roy, as well as the spokesperson for transport and municipal affairs, Martin Ouellet, request To the Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, Luc Blanchette, to renew the agreements so that snowmobile clubs retain the exclusivity of access to forest roads. 
IN SHORT 
"The snowmobile industry is more than $ 3.27 billion in spilling and 14,000 jobs in the Quebec regions. However, the new mode of governance of multi-channel paths puts the entire sector at risk. Indeed, if we remove the snowmobile clubs the exclusivity of access to forest roads and if they are forbidden to sell membership cards on different portions of their circuit, as the minister intends, the survival Some will inevitably be compromised, "said Sylvain Roy. 
"Everything worked smoothly when the file was driven by the Ministry of Natural Resources; The agreements responded quite the needs of both clubs, snowmobilers, population and resorts. But since this responsibility has been given to the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, everything goes across. In my riding, at Baie-Comeau, as well as Chapais, among others, clubs are threatened with closure; The minister must stop being so uncompromising and acting before the snowmobile season starts, "said Martin Ouellet. 
This is even a security issue: for snowmobile clubs, the sale of membership cards is essential for financing the surfacing and signaling operations, among others. The actors of this important industry expect a clear commitment from the Minister: agreements regarding the exclusivity of the right of passing on public lands must be renewed, and quickly. At the very least, Luc Blanchet must agree to meet the representatives of the Federation of Snowmobile Clubs! "Sylvain Roy concluded.
