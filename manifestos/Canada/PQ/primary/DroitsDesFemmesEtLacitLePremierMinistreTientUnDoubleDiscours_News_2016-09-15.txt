Quebec, on September 15, 2016 -The Member for Taschereau and spokesman for the Québécois in secularism, Agnès Maltais, and the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesperson for women's condition, Carole Poirier, denounce double Prime Minister's speech with respect to women's rights and secularism. 
"When the opportunity arises, the Prime Minister of Quebec, Philippe Couillard, is quick to drape in equality between men and women to criticize his political opponents who debate the religious neutrality of the state. . However, it remains well silent when the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, frequent places of worship openly advocating the segregation between men and women. In addition, Philippe Couillard remains reluctant to criticize religious leaders who impose a dress code for women in the name of religion. To do not doubt it, he holds a double speech, "said Agnès Maltese. 
"As he calls for a serene and measured debate, the Prime Minister can not help throwing oil on fire by suggesting that being a federalist is a proof of openness. It's low partisanship! Justin Trudeau, a symbol par excellence of Canadian federalism, legitimizes unacceptable remarks from religious radicals that totally deny the principle of equality between men and women, and the Prime Minister of Quebec is unable to denounce it; This clearly demonstrates that Philippe Couillard confuses the respect of the common values of Quebec with its partisan interests, "concluded Carole Poirier.
