I had the great happiness yesterday to participate in the event highlighting the 40th anniversary of the Council of the Statute of Women. By the very fact, we celebrated this will, shared by a long line of Quebecers, to act to put an end to the inequalities between men and women. 
The route of Quebec was punctuated, but also great victories that have improved their status, including the right to vote in 1940. Some 70 years later, women know that they can aspire to the highest functions. Policies. 
In short, we did, from the path: the Pay Equity Act, early childhood centers, the parental leave and all these policies that help women reconcile family and work. But our fight is not over. 
We must remain vigilant so as not to retreat on some issues. I think about abortion, which the Supreme Court decriminalized 25 years ago. However, when we hear the noises that come from Ottawa today, there is a need to worry. 
We must never lower the guard. Our progress, we owe them to women who have preceded us; Let us ensure that others will follow.
