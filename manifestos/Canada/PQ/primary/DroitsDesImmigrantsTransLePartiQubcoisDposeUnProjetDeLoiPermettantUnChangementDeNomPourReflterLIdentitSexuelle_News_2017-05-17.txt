IN SHORT 
"Although it is recognized as one of the most progressive places in the world in LGBT people, Quebec is the only jurisdiction in Canada to require Canadian citizenship to make a change of name to reflect the sexual identity. This can cause several problems to transsexual people who have chosen to settle in us by wishing to be able to fully enjoy their rights. The process for obtaining Canadian citizenship can be extremely long; Some cases show that seven years have been necessary for a transsexual immigrant to change his birth certificate; It's an aberration! "," Said Carole Poirier. 
In the eyes of the spokesperson, we must act to remedy this situation. "When people flee from the companies in which they were not accepted, it is our duty to facilitate their lives, in all possible ways. It is quite in the qu√©bec mentality and tradition, "she continued. 
"Let us remember that in the spring of 2015, the Commission of the Institutions had ruled that a reflection on this issue was urgent and necessary. The Protector of the Citizen already recommended moving forward with these legislative amendments. For us, it is a step forward very natural that we must do as a society, "concluded the member.
