Quebec- The member for Duplessis, Lorraine Richard, and the member for Vachon and the official opposition on the transport, Martine Ouellet, denounced the rejection of the Liberal government to shed light on the record of the Pakatan Corporation Meskanau. 
Yesterday at the National Assembly, Lorraine Richard, in conjunction with the member for Groulx and the member for Mercier, filed a motion asking the Auditor General to seize the file; Unfortunately, the motion was rejected by the Liberal government. 
"Several villages in Lower North Shore are still isolated, despite the $ 47 million spent on the road. Many allegations of irregularities have been expressed in the management of this project. Only 12 kilometers of road were built; The Auditor General has to shed light on this situation, "said Lorraine Richard. 
"For a government that wanted to be transparent, I find it strange that the Liberals rejected this motion. We are talking about $ 47 million in public funds! The Liberal government must take its responsibilities on this issue, "added Martine Ouellet. 
The motion rejected by the Liberals reads as follows: 
"That the National Assembly recalls that in July 2013, following allegations of many irregularities in the management processes, the Ministry of Transport of the Government of the Parti Québécois decided to terminate the Framework Agreement with the PAKATAN MESKANAU corporation of the Great Seduction (Pakatan) in the roadscrewing project of several villages in Lower North Shore. 
That the National Assembly stresses that today, $ 47 million of public funds have been spent and only 12 kilometers of road have been built. 
That the National Assembly points out that today, several villages in Lower North Shore are still isolated, despite the amounts spent. 
That the National Assembly asks the Auditor General of Quebec to seize the file to shed light on the reasons for the failure of the Agreement between the Government of Quebec and the Pakatan Group. »
