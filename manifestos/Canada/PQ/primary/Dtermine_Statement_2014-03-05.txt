Since the election of our government 18 months ago, we have accomplished a lot. 
We acted with force by adopting severe laws against corruption. We have resumed control of government spending for the first time in 10 years. We gave order to the management of major infrastructure projects, which has already saved hundreds of millions of dollars. We have created thousands of daycare places for our children. We started the turn to allow our elders to age at home, receiving home care. We have released Quebec from nuclear and asbestos. We took care of our world, including those who faced very painful collective tests. 
And we have supported the Quebec economy very actively. 
The results are there: never, in all the history of Quebec, there were so many people at work as at this moment. 
Unfortunately, the Liberals and the Caquists have only one goal: blocking the government. We filed a responsible budget, but they had decided to oppose it even before reading it. By doing so, it's not just the government, but all Quebec that the opposition brakes. If we want Quebec to take its momentum, we must end the blockage of the opposition. 
Everything is in place. All we need is to have the means to act. What I ask you is to give us these means. 
We have the plan. We have the team. We have the determination. 
My team is determined. I determined.
