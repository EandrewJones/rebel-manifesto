The Parti Québécois works tirelessly to increase employment in Quebec. And, despite monthly data on very volatile job variations, the results are there. 
In fact, for the first time in our history, they are more than 4 million Quebeckers who are at work. We are on the right path. 
Not only does the Parti Québécois stimulate employment but we want to encourage the creation of better jobs for Quebecers and Quebeckers. 
The variations of February 2014 come, for the most part, part-time jobs. At the same time, 2,900 full-time jobs were added. It must be remembered that last year, February had declined the level of employment and, despite everything, the year ended with more than 47,800 new jobs. 
Our goal remains the same: aim for the creation of 44,800 jobs, an increase of 1.1% in 2014. A realistic objective. The banker of Philippe Couillard, Carlos Leitao, prevailed almost the same thing last January: a rise in employment of 1.2%. 
But our ambitions are even bigger, thanks to the Priority Employment Policy. 
As Québec Premier, Quebec Economic Prime Minister emphasized today would create more than 44,000 new jobs by 2017. These jobs will be added to new jobs already planned for the same period. 
In total, the government is aimed at the creation of 125,000 new jobs over the next three years. 
Economic growth observed in the last few months shows a significant increase in employment in Quebec. 
In its 2014 forecasts published in January, the banker of Philippe Couillard, Carlos Leitao anticipated an increase in employment by 1.2% in Quebec in 2014. Our budget provides for 1.1%: a similar and more conservative forecast.
