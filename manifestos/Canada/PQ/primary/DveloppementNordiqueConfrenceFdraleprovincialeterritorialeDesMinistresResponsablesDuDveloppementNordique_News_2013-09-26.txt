Quebec- On the sidelines of the Northern Development Forum, which took place in Fort McMurray from 23 to 25 September, the Minister of Natural Resources, Mrs. Martine Ouellet, is able to find that Quebec shares many of the issues that are common to the provinces and territories. On the occasion of this conference, the minister was represented by his secretary-general associated with Nordic development, Mr. Bernard Lauzon, who led the Quebec delegation. 
Quebec has stimulated that the end of the federal funding for social housing and the end of the operating conventions covering Nunavik's social housing is problematic given the needs that are important. 
Quebec has also informed colleagues that its government has recently committed to exploring telecommunications solutions in Nunavik, since it considers it essential for its residents. 
Martine Ouellet wanted to reiterate that natural resources fall within the competence of Quebec and indicated that: 
"Quebec promotes discussions on a bilateral basis with other governments that share a common interest on topics specific to the areas of natural resources, with respect for constitutional skills." 
The Minister added that Bill 43 amending the Mining Act will provide more transparency throughout the operation of a mine and to maximize the benefits for local and regional communities by the local agreements and committees. For Martine Ouellet, transparency is an essential element in establishing a climate of trust between the population and industry, an essential element for the success of mining projects. 
Finally, Quebec has committed to participate, insofar as it deems appropriate, in the continuation of the activities of the working sub-groups with respect to the priorities established for 2014.
