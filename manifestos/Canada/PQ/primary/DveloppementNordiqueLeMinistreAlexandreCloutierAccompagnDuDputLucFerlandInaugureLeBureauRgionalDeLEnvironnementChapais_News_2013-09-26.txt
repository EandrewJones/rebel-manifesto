"Given the growing challenges related to the rapid development of Nordic territory, the presence of a regional office was required. We will have the necessary tools to be able to intervene more effectively and quickly when needed. I am convinced that the team in place will be an invaluable resource for the region and will develop and will evolve with local and regional needs, "said Minister Cloutier. 
"The choice of Chapais has been the subject of consensus among regional stakeholders. This office is linked to the Regional Directorate of Abitibi-Témiscamingue and Northern Quebec, which is a pole of Nordic and mining expertise for the ministry. The Chapais Office has the mandate to ensure the national coherence of the laws and regulations governing the mining sector, and the coordination of ministry interventions in Nordic territory. In addition, a liaison officer is facilitating contacts between the Ministry and the Cree, Inuit and Naskapie communities in the territory, "said Ferland. 
The opening of this new office in Chapais opens the door to more efficient resource management, with respect for communities and the environment. This is a major asset for the smooth running of regional operations.
