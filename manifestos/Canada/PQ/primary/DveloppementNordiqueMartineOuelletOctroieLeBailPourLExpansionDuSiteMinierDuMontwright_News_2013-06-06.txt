Quebec- The Minister of Natural Resources, Mrs. Martine Ouellet, announces the attribution of a mining lease in Arcelor Mittal for his project of the Hespee Lake, which will allow the expansion of the Mont-Wright mining site. Iron extraction operations will begin in a few weeks. 
"The expansion of the Mont-Wright mining site means 725 additional jobs over a period of almost 30 years. This is a great news for the North Shore, where the mining industry is at the heart of economic development, "said Martine Ouellet. 
In the spirit of the deposit of the Program of Law 43, for a new Mining Act, the minister asked Arcelor Mittal to voluntarily file a feasibility study to increase the transformation of iron ore in Quebec. Arcelor Mittal already has an iron treatment plant in Port Cartier as well as processing plants and Montreal. The study to increase the transformation in its current facilities or in new facilities may be filed in the next year. 
The new mining site will increase production from 15 to 24 million tonnes of iron concentrate. Arcelor Mittal's investment for the Mont-Wright project is $ 1.2 billion. This includes the operation of the mine as well as work on the railway and port facilities of Sept-ÃŽles. 
"I am very happy that Acelor Mittal begins to exploit the Hespee Lake. These are major benefits for the region, especially for the Caniapiscau MRC, "said Lorraine Richard, MP for Duplessis. 
Of the 725 additional jobs that will be created, 525 jobs will be for the mining site and 200 jobs for the work of the railway as well as the port facilities. Currently, nearly 1,000 employees work at Mont-Wright's mining complex.
