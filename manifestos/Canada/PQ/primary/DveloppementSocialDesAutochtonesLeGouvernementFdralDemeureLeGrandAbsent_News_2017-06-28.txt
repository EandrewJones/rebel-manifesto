Quebec -The official opposition spokesperson for Aboriginal affairs, education, research, school perseverance and literacy, Alexandre Cloutier, is pleased with the filing of an action plan for development Social of the Aboriginal Nations of Quebec, while reiterating that the disengagement of the federal government remains the crux of the problem. 
IN SHORT 
"Prime Minister Trudeau pronounces great words. But the reality is that the federal government, for over a decade, has completely disengaged from its responsibilities to Aboriginal people. As a result, it is the Quebec government that must take care of it, "has immediately reacted Alexandre Cloutier. 
"According to the data from the Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat, between 2003 and 2010, the Government of Quebec alone assumed 75% of the increase in public transfers to indigenous communities. Clearly, the federal government dropped and tries to free themselves from its obligations. The examples are also numerous: police services, cures of detoxification, social housing, education, etc. ", Listed the spokesperson. 
Alexandre Cloutier insists: The success of Aboriginal people, like that of all the nations of the world, first and foremost goes through education. "The federal government must take the necessary means to promote educational success in Aboriginal communities; It is his responsibility, it is his duty, and he must not be scrolled, "he concluded.
