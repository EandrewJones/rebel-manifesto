Quebec- Following the announcement of the Federal Minister of the Environment, which suspends the $ 8 billion wastewater spill project in the St. Lawrence River, the member for Terrebonne and Party Spokesman Quebeckers in sustainable development, environment and climate change, Mathieu Traversy, regrets that the Quebec Minister of the Environment, David Heurtel, or to the Conservative government trailer when it comes to protection of the environment. 
"It's been two weeks since we ask David Huttel to suspend the authorization given to the City of Montreal. We demanded that it show transparency by making all scientific advice and all impact studies supporting its decision. He unveiled only some documents and information to the gout-record, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
The Couillard government has really shown incompetence and improvisation in this file. "We know that the federal campaign is in full swing and the Conservatives probably only act by political opportunism. That said, it is the Quebec Minister of the Environment to take all appropriate measures to protect citizens and the environment. Once again, it's embarrassing that David Heurtel passes the Conservatives for environmental advocates, "added the member. 
Remember that the Parti Québécois claims the resignation of David Heurtel from his position as Minister of the Environment since June 5, 2015.
