Quebec- The member for Terrebonne and spokesman for the Québécois on sustainable development, environment and the fight against climate change, Mathieu Traversy, is worried that the City of Montreal has announced that it intended to proceed to Spill of eight billion liters of wastewater in the St. Lawrence River. On behalf of the Québécois Party, he asks the Minister of the Environment to suspend the authorization given to the City of Montreal, so that we can evaluate all the options and retain the least damaging and sustainable solution. 
"The Quebec state is the common heritage guardian that is our water. The Minister must immediately apply the precautionary principles, protection of the environment and respect for the capacity of ecosystem support, and to order a more in-depth analysis of the situation. The advice of independent experts is essential to assess the option that will limit the most impact on the environment, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
These last days, several scientists, social and environmental collectives, mayors and citizens expressed their great concerns, believing that the quality of the St. Lawrence River water is at stake, as well as ecosystems of national interest, such as the Lake Saint-Pierre. The Ministry of the Environment has a responsibility in the management of wastewater; He must act immediately, have they expressed. 
In addition, in this case, the official opposition requires transparency from the Minister of the Environment. "The population claims more transparency from the Ministry of the Environment. All the analyzes that led him to give his authorization must be made public. Like other groups, we want to know if this analysis was carried out by people with the competence to make a judgment on the construction methods proposed by the city. The principle of access to knowledge is part of the principles of sustainable development, "concluded Mathieu Traversy.
