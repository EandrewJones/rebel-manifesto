Quebec- The member for Terrebonne and spokesman for the Quebecois on sustainable development, environment and climate change development, Mathieu Traversy, reiterates his request to the Minister of the Environment, David Heurtel, for suspended The authorization granted to the City of Montreal to proceed to the spill of eight billion liters of wastewater into the Saint Lawrence River, as the Environment Canada now claimed, and for the public notices and all the analyzes on which he based himself to make his decision. 
"It is still incredible to note that the Conservative government is more prompt to protect the St. Lawrence River and its fauna than the Government of Quebec. Casing the Conservatives for environmental advocates, here is a real tower! "Said Mathieu Traversy. 
For several days, the Québécois party has been asking the Minister of the Environment to suspend the authorization given to the City of Montreal so that we can evaluate all options and ensure that the least harmful and sustainable solution. 
"The minister has been aware of this situation, and we should believe it about it when the spill turns out the only possible solution, and that there will only have minimal impacts on the Environment and public health? It should rather be transparent and give all the relevant information to the population, "the member continued. 
"The minister has no credibility. We are asking for its resignation again, as we have done several months ago, as a result of its irresponsible management of the Drilling File in Cacouna, and when it declined about the holding of a BAPE on the Project of the Port of Quebec, "concluded Mathieu Traversy.
