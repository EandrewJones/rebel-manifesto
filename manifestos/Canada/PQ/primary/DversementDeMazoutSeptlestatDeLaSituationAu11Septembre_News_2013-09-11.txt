Québec- The Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks takes stock of the situation in Sept-Îles following the important oil spill at the Cliffs Natural Resources Stock Factory (Cliffs) on September 1st. 
The aerial overview of 11 September revealed that only the secatacade sector confining the banks presented a trace of iridescence. Stakeholders continue to ensure rigorous monitoring of the situation as the variable tides and weather conditions in the region ensure that there is still a risk of release in the bay. In addition, two ministry biologists are on hand to gather the information needed to produce the best methods to use the salty marsh and the zosteraie (herbarium). 
The department ensures that Cliffs deploys all necessary efforts to quickly correct the situation. In addition, the recovery and cleaning operations of the banks are going well. The work is adapted according to the evolution of the situation. All measures are currently being implemented to recover the maximum of this contaminant, as soon as possible. 
Remember that the file has been transferred to the Department's investigations service for criminal prosecution.
