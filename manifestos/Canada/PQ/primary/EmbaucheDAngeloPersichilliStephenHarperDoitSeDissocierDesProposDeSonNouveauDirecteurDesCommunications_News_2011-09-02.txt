Quebec -The MEP for Marie-Victorin and official opposition spokesperson for Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Bernard Drainville, invites Prime Minister Stephen Harper to dissociate themselves from the remarks a few months ago. His new director of communications, Angelo Persichilli, while signed a column in an Ontario daily. 
"Mr. Harper knows very well the consequences of this type of totally unacceptable purpose. Canadian Prime Minister has always sentenced Quebec Bashing from English Canada. I am confident that he does not share the words of his director of communications and I ask him to send a clear message to the Quebec people and dissociate themselves from the words of Mr. Persichilli, "said Bernard Drainville. . 
The member for Marie-Victorin pointed out that Canadian bilingualism, a huge waste according to Mr. Persichilli, is practically unresponsive in the rest of Canada and that it is wrong to say that Quebec is proud to receive from the Equalization. "In several files, it is the federal government that prevents Quebec from developing and getting rich. The file of Old Harry is a very good example, "he added. 
In addition, Bernard Drainville asks the Government of Quebec, through its Minister of Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Pierre Moreau, to do as the Parti Québécois, and ask Stephen Harper to dissociate themselves. "It's a question of basic respect and it is the responsibility of the Government of Quebec to react. Quebeckers form a proud and singular nation, just like the Canadian nation. Often, we do not share the same point of view but, it should never prevent us from devisingly mutual respect. Citizens are entitled to expect the example to come first politicians, whether elected or not, "concluded Bernard Drainville.
