Quebec- The member for Saint-Jérôme and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, as well as the member for Saint-Jean and Spokesperson for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, ask Prime Minister Philippe Couillard to respond to the urgent need to hold an economic summit. 
"Quebec, at the economic level, stagnates since the arrival of the Liberals. The North Plan and the Maritime Strategy are long-term promises, while people lose their jobs now. Still this week, the Paperworks Factory of Baie-d'Orfé announced its closure; 150 workers lose their jobs, not forgetting the 140 others who suffer the same fate due to the stopping of activities at the Graphic Packaging of Jonquière. Quebec needs a government that takes things in hand, which is absolutely not the case now, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"Since the beginning of April 2014, Quebec has created only 29,300 jobs. Recall that Philippe Couillard, in election campaign, promised 50,000 per year. After 16 months in power, the Liberals are seriously lacking at their promise towards Quebeckers, "said the member for Saint-Jean. 
"Despite the decline in the Canadian dollar, the manufacturing sector does not resume vigor. Job losses in several sectors of the economy accumulate, without the government reacting. Women and men who lose their jobs, however, live difficult situations and must be supported! Added Dave Turcotte. 
"The Minister of the Economy, Jacques Daoust, and the Prime Minister do not know what to do in economic matters and to stimulate the creation of jobs they refer the ball to young liberals, who will meet on August 15 and 16 in Shawinigan, hoping for a miracle. They do not have a plan and desperately looking for a life buoy. We are still swimming in full amateurism in the Liberal government, "concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
