Qu√©bec- The Quebec government maintains, for the fourth year in a row, the freezing of the performance bonuses for the holders of a higher employment, for the reference period 2012-2013. "Quebec is in a particular context where all are called upon to do their fair share, including holders of a higher employment of the public and parapublic sectors appointed by the government," said Quebec Prime Minister Pauline Marois. 
By way of decree, the Government therefore suspends the granting of a yield bonus, provided for in the performance and review assessment policy for higher employment holders. This decision aims to maintain the return to budget balance and debt reduction, as announced by the Minister of Finance and the Economy, Nicolas Marceau, when filing the budget. "This does not question the appreciation of the outstanding achievements and performance of each higher employment holder. On the contrary, it is a concrete gesture for all taxpayers in Quebec, which uses the solidarity of all, "said Pauline Marois. 
This gel targets some 700 higher employment holders who are primarily deputy ministers, deputy deputy ministers, presidents, vice-presidents and members of government agencies, and represents approximately $ 6 million in savings for Quebec.
