Since his election in September 2012, my government has not been unemployed. We are doing everything in place to give an impetus in Quebec. 
Our goal is clear: we want Quebeckers to be richer, individually and collectively. For the future, we will continue to prepare Quebec to become a country, responsibly, without shaking Quebeckers, but with a lot of determination. The time will come when we are once again called upon to choose our political future. Our responsibility is to strengthen us, to prepare for this moment. 
Then, you have to take the time to fully think, as a nation, in our political future. We have not taken the time to do it for almost 20 years. It's time for us to take stock and think about the path traveled and the road we need to take. 
I announce it tonight: During the next mandate, a Quebec party government will present a white paper on the future of Quebec. 
Of course, we can not presume the leadership that Quebeckers will take. Nor the moment we will be ready to make our choices. But we will propose a clear avenue. 
And, contrary to what Philippe Couillard wants by signing the Constitution without consulting Quebeckers, I can guarantee that the choice will rest between your hands: we will decide our future and no one else! 
At the Parti Québécois, we are determined to make Quebec a rich country. A proud country, united around our common values. A solidarity country, where we take care of our world. A country where we speak French. A Quebec country! 
This ambition, this will, this determination, we must share it with our family, our friends, our neighbors. 
We start from far away and we have already made a lot of way. We must continue to move forward without fail. I am determined to continue the road to the end. 
Now it depends on you, it depends on us.
