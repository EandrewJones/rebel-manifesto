IN SHORT 
"Minister Thériault today has the opportunity to act to better protect buyers from a new residence. While British Columbia and Alberta have already legislated to supervise the building inspector by making the exercise license compulsory, and that Ontario is preparing to follow suit, the Government of Philippe Couillard. He locks himself in an embarrassing silence, "said Guy Leclair. 
In Quebec, more than 6 out of 10 people use a building inspector before concluding the purchase of a new property. "As legislators, we must supervise this profession. Currently, anyone can claim building inspector; The risks of being felt are very real, as much for buyers and sellers. At this stage of the purchase process, the most important thing is trust. A government of the Parti Québécois would immediately take the means to ensure the reliability of inspections, "he continued. 
"Legifier always seems a painful and insurmountable process, until a framework is actually put in place and become natural. Today, there remains a last weak link to tackle in the process of buying and selling properties: that of building inspection. We want inspectors to work according to clear and stringent standards, "concluded Mario Roy.
