Quebec- The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesman of the Parti Quebec in education, research and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, asks the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, SÃ©bastien Proulx, To act so that the children of immigrants without status can go to school like the others, and without delay. 
"Due to the ride of ministers of education, the file of undocumented students stretches and no solution is put forward by the department. Hundreds, perhaps even thousands of students will not go to school this year because their immigrant status is not confirmed for many reasons. The minister must solve the problem and, in the meantime, use his discretion so that the children concerned can go to school as quickly as possible, "the member exposed. 
"The Government of Quebec declared itself bound by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, according to which primary education is compulsory and free for all. The states that adhere to it must also promote access to secondary education. In addition, as the Protector of the Citizen concludes, any child domiciled in Quebec must have access to free public education and frequent primary or secondary school, regardless of immigration status or That of his parents, "said Alexandre Cloutier. 
Let us mention that Ontario and British Columbia admit, at no cost, people without legal status in public school. Why is Quebec a delay in the file? "By Bill 86 on the governance of the education network, without addressing the problem completely, the Ministry expanded at least the right to free schooling to non-residents. However, after bringing this bill to the trash, the government introduced us to a new version, Bill 105, which makes no mention of this important issue. In short, the government declines even before having advanced, "the spokesman concluded.
