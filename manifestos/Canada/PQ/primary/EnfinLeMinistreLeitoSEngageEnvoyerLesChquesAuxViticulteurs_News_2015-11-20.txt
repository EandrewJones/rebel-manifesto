Quebec- The spokesman for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, is pleased to have successfully obtained a commitment from the Minister of Finance as to the support that needs to be brought to Quebec winerowers. Indeed, after evolving the morning issue yesterday, Carlos Leitão returned to his position when the member for Berthier has arrested again, early evening, to the National Assembly. 
"The Viticultural Support Program, enhanced by the Québécois party in 2013, has allowed a dazzling increase in sales of Quebec wines. The procrastination of the Liberal government affect the pursuit of this growth. Checks should be filed for a long time. The winemakers have invested significant amounts, and government payments put their businesses at risk, "said André Villeneuve. 
It should be remembered that for the second year in a row, it took an intervention of the official opposition to the National Assembly for the Minister of Finance to respect the commitment made by his Government. 
"It's abnormal that I had to intervene, again this year, so that the government honors its word. The winemakers fulfilled their share of the contract and invested considerably to increase their presence on the market. This is the smallest thing the government respects its commitment and pays the money it owes to these entrepreneurs. Besides, where was the Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, in this case? He should have been there for winemakers and intervene with his colleague so that checks are sent quickly, "concluded the member for Berthier.
