Québec- MP Martine Ouellet, spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on transport, maritime strategy and transport electrification, welcomes the filing of the bill 100 on the taxi industry. 
"Finally, a bill for the taxi industry! We finally have an answer to our requests, after two years of illegal taxi, after two transport ministers, and eight months after we have promised a bill. I am pleased that the Minister of Transport, Jacques Daoust, listened to the main demand of the Parti Québécois: that there is only one law that applies to all workers. This is important for the 22,000 taxi industry workers, "said the member for Vachon. 
"Also, other requests we had formulated were listened to. As we proposed in our bill, the suspension of permits is found in what has been tabled this morning. On the other hand, there is an increase in the fines, as proposed by the Parti Québécois, "said the spokesman. 
"In terms of service improvement for clients, measures such as rates modulation and service assessment are also included in the bill," Martine Ouellet continued. 
"There are, however, several elements that will have to be clarified, especially those concerning the perception of taxes, a question to which Minister Daoust is particularly sensitive. We will have the opportunity to come back to these elements when studying the bill in committee, "added the member for Vachon. 
"Finally, changes to the Road Safety Code to better protect cyclists are also expected and are welcome. I conclude by offering our collaboration to the minister for the bill to be adopted by the end of the parliamentary session, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
