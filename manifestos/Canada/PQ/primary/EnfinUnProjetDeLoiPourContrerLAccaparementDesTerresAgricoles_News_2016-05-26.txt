Quebec, May 26, 2016 - The member for Berthier and spokesman for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, today tabled Bill 599, An Act to counter grabbing agricultural land. 
"I am proud to act concretely, today, against grabbing of agricultural land. These lands are a limited resource. For this reason, they have become a safe haven for some private investment funds, which has caused an increase in their price. In Quebec, we have made the choice to keep agriculture on a human scale, so focus on the family farm model. A year ago, at my request, consultations on land grabbing have been held; Several speakers then came to tell us that it was necessary to legislate to protect this model. Yet the government and the CAQ decided to do nothing. The Québécois party chose to act because the status quo is unacceptable, "said André Villeneuve. 
The terms of the bill will ensure that any transaction involving agricultural land should be declared to the Quebec Agricultural Territory Protection Commission (CPTAQ). For the acquisition of land bringing the total land with more than 100 hectares, the CPTAQ will have to authorize the transaction according to a number of criteria, to ensure that it is a farmer who became owner. . A transaction concluded in violation of the law will be declared zero, and fines - up to $ 30,000 for a business and up to $ 5,000 for a natural person - are planned. 
"Agricultural land must belong to farmers. The latter, as well as their succession and municipalities, ask us to act. That's why I tabled this bill: to combat investment funds who are interested in Quebec lands in a purely speculative manner, not for the benefit of agriculture, "concluded the Member of Parliament for Berthier.
