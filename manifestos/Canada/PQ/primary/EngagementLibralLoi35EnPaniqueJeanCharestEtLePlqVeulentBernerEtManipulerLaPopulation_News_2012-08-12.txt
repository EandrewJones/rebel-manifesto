Montreal- The member and candidate of the Parti Québécois in the riding of Gouin, Nicolas Girard, denounced the attempt to manipulate the public opinion made by Jean Charest this morning. "The Liberal commitment of a new law is an electoral lure. Jean Charest refused to correct the breaches of the law 35 before the end of the parliamentary session as we had offered his collaboration. It's too little, too late. Jean Charest and the Liberal Party are responsible for lowering ethical standards and the multiplication of cases of corruption. » 
Remember that the Québécois party has exhibited that a company related to Tony Accurso, Louisbourg SBC, has obtained $ 180 million in Ministry of Transport contracts between guilty advocacy for tax evasion of two companies by Mr. Accurso (December 2010) and the submission of Bill 35 (October 2011). "The Minister Lise Thériault claimed that no more fraudulent entrepreneur could obtain government contracts. Yet the Louisbourg SBC company already received many government contracts at the time of submitting the bill 35. Was the government closed in a voluntary way? "Questioned Nicolas Girard. 
"On several occasions, we demanded the filing of a bill before the end of the parliamentary session in June to close the tap to Tony Accurso number companies. The Liberals have always refused, not judging it priority. Suddenly, in election campaign it becomes it. It feels panic in the liberal family, "added Nicolas Girard. 
"On September 4, Quebeckers will have the opportunity to choose a government that will give the order, which will bring cleaning and bringing integrity and honesty. The Parti Québécois has the competence, knowledge and team to do so. It's the best place to change things, "concluded Nicolas Girard.
