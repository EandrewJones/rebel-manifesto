Quebec-in the light of the newspaper this morning, the member for Verchères and the official opposition spokesperson for public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, reiterated the request made by the Quebecois party since now. Two years of holding a public and independent commission on the construction industry in Quebec. 
"Since September 2009, we are trying to make reason to Jean Charest and his government. They turn a deaf ear and since then, the problems multiply. As the title the newspaper this morning, it's more than simple rumors. Employers and employees in the construction sector are equally concerned that the rest of the population in terms of clarity and corruption allegations in the sector they work. We are no longer talking about speculation as suggested by the Prime Minister for two years, but of proven facts! "Said the hon. Member for Verchères. 
"The squads set up to counter corruption give very little results. The hammer squad and the UPAC give results that are clearly not up to the problems we mentioned. Some small arrests will not say the problem. We are dealing with an oiled organized system and we must take the great ways so that it ceases, "added Stéphane Bergeron. 
"As an example of a situation that has to stop, the companies constructions Louisbourg Ltée and Simard-Beaudry Construction Inc., Tony Accurso properties, retain their license from the Régie du Building du Québec and still obtain government contracts as if Nothing was, more than six months after Mr. Accurso pleaded guilty to charges of fiscal fraud. It's aberrant! , Added the member. 
"It is clear that the actions posed since the beginning of the crisis in the construction industry are not enough. It is an absolute necessity that Jean Charest finally hears reason and he set up without waiting for a public and independent commission on the construction industry, "concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
