Québec - "The recent studies of the Lionel-Groulx Foundation on the Square of History at College and in university training as well as the study on history courses in high school challenges us. The teaching of our national history recedes within our educational institutions, it is very disturbing. We can not stay arms crossed. The Parti Québécois asks the Government to hold a parliamentary committee in order to study the teaching of history in our schools as well as its place in the training of masters, "said the member for Taillon and spokesperson. Official opposition in higher education, Marie Malavoy, the member for Jonquière and spokesperson for primary and secondary education, Sylvain Gaudreault, as well as the member for Sainte-Marie-Saint-Jacques and Vice-President of the Committee on Culture and Education, Martin Lemay. 
"The finding of researchers is alarming, teachers who transmit our national history to high school students lack knowledge. These same students arrive at college where history courses are endangered. I do not understand that the Minister of Education does not care about this issue at all. Future generations will not have enough knowledge of our national, political and institutional history, it is unacceptable, "Marie Malavoy denounced. 
For its part, the member for Jonquière also deplores the new tangent of secondary history teaching. "You have to restore a perspective on the evolution of national history. There are a number of facts and a number of texts that need to be known and studied. It is imperative to ensure that our students have the opportunity to do it at school, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
"How to understand that a French-speaking nation could not only subsist, but develop in North America? Only the study of national history can explain this phenomenon. It would be great time that it finds its letters of nobility. That is why we will ask the Commission to seize this mandate and we wish to be accepted, "concluded Martin Lemay.
