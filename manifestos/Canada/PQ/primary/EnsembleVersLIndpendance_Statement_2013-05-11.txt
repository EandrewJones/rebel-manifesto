People have been said recently that volunteers, in political parties, it did not exist anymore. This is perhaps the case elsewhere but, the Parti Québécois, there are thousands. 
Quebeckers and dedicated Quebecers who spend time and energy to advance the idea that gathers us all of the Parti Québécois, that of making Quebec a country. 
There are more people in our party left and more on the right. There are 18-year-olds and others who are 88 years old. There are people from Gaspésie and others from Lévis. De Jonquière to Chibougamau, via Trois-Rivières and Baie-Comeau. 
From left to right, from east to west and from north to south, which brings us together, what we want is independence!
