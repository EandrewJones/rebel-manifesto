The member for Taillon, Diane Lamarre, the candidate of the Quebecois party in Taschereau, Diane Lavallée, and the candidate in Repentigny, Dr. Eric Tremblay, denounce the double speech of the head of the CAQ, François Legault. "On one side, he is committed to Quebeckers to review the remuneration of doctors; On the other hand, he seduced candidates by promising not to reopen the agreement with specialist doctors. François Legault is not serious! "Abstract Diane Lamarre. 
IN SHORT 
"Last Saturday, we learn that François Legault, hoping to seduce a possible candidate, gave way: finally, he would not reopen the agreement with the specialist doctors, even if he had to withdraw from his financial framework all the measures that would have been Funded from the sums he intended to pick up in the pockets of doctors, as many promises made to Quebecers in recent months, "said the member for Taillon. 
"There are no two truths: according to whom he is addressed, François Legault speaks on both sides of the mouth, simply. We now understand that his beautiful promises were only wind, that he has never been serious when he said to see the remuneration of doctors. How could Quebecers trust such a credible man who says one thing and his opposite, according to the context? On his side added Diane Lavallée. 
"Unlike the head of the CAQ, we, the Parti Québécois, we are serious when we are committed to reopening the agreement with the doctors. The health system needs more nurses, more beneficiary attendants, more professional resources to better treat people. Many doctors are considering that they are paid enough, and that the increase in their remuneration is not how to improve the care of the population, "said Eric Tremblay, initiator of the Movement of Physicians who claim the cancellation of their salary increases.
