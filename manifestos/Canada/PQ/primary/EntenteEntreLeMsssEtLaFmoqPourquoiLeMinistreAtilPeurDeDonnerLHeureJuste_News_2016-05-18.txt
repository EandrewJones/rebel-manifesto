Québec-Diane Lamarre, Member of Parliament for Québec Québécois in the field of health and accessibility to care, deplores the lack of transparency of the Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette, with respect to the follow-up of the targets fixed In the agreement he concluded with the FMOQ to avoid the application of Bill 20. 
"What we have learned recently is that despite the return of the bolduc premium and the other premiums to the registration granted to doctors in the FMOQ, almost one year ago, the targets fixed will be missed. In fact, in a communiqué transmitted to its members and published on the Web, the President of the FMOQ confirmed a few days ago that the targets planned, that is to say, that 85% of the population is registered with A family doctor by 2018, will hardly be reached, since there is still a million orphan patients, "said Diane Lamarre. 
"Quarterly reports should be produced to follow the evolution of patient care. However, despite our repeated requests, the Minister Barrette refuses to make them public. If his agreement was so good, he would not hide the results ... These reports should give us the time just about the attendance rate of doctors, but, on that it too, the Minister refuses to transmit the information to parliamentarians and citizens. Why? , "Added the spokesman. 
"The Minister's understanding with the FMOQ is a fought announced, and Bill 20 is not a more acceptable solution for physicians than for patients. The Québécois party believes that the front-line work and patient care should not be based solely on the shoulders of doctors. It is more time to take advantage of the skills of other health professionals, to develop solutions that take into account the patient first, "concluded the member.
