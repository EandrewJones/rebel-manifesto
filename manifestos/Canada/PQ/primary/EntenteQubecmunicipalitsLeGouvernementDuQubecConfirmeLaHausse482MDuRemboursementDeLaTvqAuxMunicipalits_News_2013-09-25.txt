Quebec- The Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau, and the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the Territory and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, keep to remember that the amount provided for by the Government for the Reimbursement of the QST to the municipalities will increase from $ 472 million, in 2013, to $ 482 million, in 2014. "At the request of municipal organizations, we have agreed to extend the agreement on a new tax partnership and one year's financial, the time to finish the negotiation of a new agreement. There is no question of reducing amounts transferred to municipalities, "said Minister Marceau. 
On the other hand, municipalities have been informed by the previous government under the TVQ-TPS Harmonization Agreement, the regime that will apply in Quebec from 2014 will be similar to the GST rebate regime. In concrete terms, the municipalities will be reimbursed according to the amounts actually paid, and not on an estimated amount, as is currently the case. To comply with the best accounting rules, municipalities must therefore review certain practices. 
"Let's be clear: there is no surprise for municipalities. The rules relating to the harmonization of taxes have been known since March 2012 and had been communicated to municipal organizations by the Liberal government. I am convinced that municipalities pursue as much as we go to implement best practices, "concluded Minister Gaudreault.
