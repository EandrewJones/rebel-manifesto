Quebec- Minister of Public Safety, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, and Opitciwan's Atikamekw's Head of Council, Mr. Christian Awashish, announce that the Department of Public Safety and the Opitciwan Atikamekw Council have agreed on The principles of an agreement aimed at the provision of police services in the Opitciwan Community. The Police Corps of Opitciwan will therefore remain in office after March 31, 2014. 
"This agreement is part of the spirit of openness and mutual respect that the Government of Quebec wants to maintain in its relations with the First Nations and the Inuit. In these negotiations, the Quebec nations and Atikamek share the same objective that is to ensure the safety of citizens. It is therefore no doubt that by working together, we will arrive at lasting solutions, "said Minister of Public Safety Stéphane Bergeron. 
In recent weeks, discussions have allowed parties to agree on the main parameters that will allow Opitciwan's public security to provide police services for the 2014-2015 fiscal year. As part of this agreement, a pilot project aimed at promoting Opitciwan Police Corps will be set up. This includes the loan of a Quebec Security Officer to the Community to oversee, as Interim Director, the operations of the police force. The exact modalities of the Agreement concerning Opitciwan will not be revealed, however, since they should be endorsed as part of formal agreements. 
"I am pleased with the positive denouement of our recent exchanges with the Government of Quebec, which has demonstrated a very appreciated opening. This pilot project will allow us to better meet the needs of our population, while adequately assessing the level of resources needed to provide quality police services in our community, "has concluded Chief Awashish. 
Remember that police service provision agreements in Québec's Aboriginal communities are funded 52% by the Government of Canada and 48% by the Quebec government.
