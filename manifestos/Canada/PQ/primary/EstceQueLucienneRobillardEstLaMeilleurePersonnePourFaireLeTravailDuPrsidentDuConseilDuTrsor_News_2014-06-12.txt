Quebec- The member for Richelieu and the official opposition spokesman for the Treasury Board, Élain Zakaïb, judge that Lucienne Robillard is not the right person to lead the committee for the ongoing review of programs set up by the President Treasury Board, Martin Coiteous. 
"Lucienne Robillard has been part of the Council of Ministers of a Liberal government during the worst years of Quebec history management. A government that, in the early 1990s, had first left program expenditures increase by 8%, and then 10%, and then leave the power with a deficit of 6 billion, "said Élaine Zakaïb. 
Lucienne Robillard was then a member of the Council of Ministers of Jean Chrétien, the responsible government of the sponsorship scandal. She also stated that the fiscal imbalance is a myth and that the illegal expenditures of half a million dollars in option Canada were anecdotal spending. 
"The President of the Treasury Board must justify the decision to appoint Lucienne Robillard to the head of the Commission, which he refused to do today. As this commission will be responsible for identifying the cuts that do Quebec people, the least would be why the Liberals chose Lucienne Robillard to lead her, "said the hon. Member for Richelieu.
