The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesman for the Parti Québécois in school education and perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, deplores improvisation and blunders who forced the Minister of Education to grant all points question 22 of the ministerial test of history to all students. He asks the Minister to intervene quickly to prevent such a situation from happening again. 
"Social networks did not arrive in Quebec in 2016. It is time for the department to adjust its practices to ensure the confidentiality of the events. If we add the mathematics exam two weeks earlier, the department committed this error twice rather than a while at the end of the 2015-2016 school year. This is unacceptable. The minister announces today that he will see his ministry's practices, but he should have intervened from the first leaks of the mathematics examination. It will now have to be transparent on the actions it will ask to restore public confidence, "said Alexandre Cloutier. 
Despite the minister's catch-up efforts, departmental leaks on social networks will have compromised the history review assessment process. 
"As a result of the review, the Department made the decision to cancel question 22. This very serious decision has been taken without investigation and without consulting the Minister. This department's improvisation will have caused a lot of stress to hundreds of students. The minister and his department simply did not do their job, and it is the credibility of the evaluation process that is compromised, "said the member for Lac? Saint? Jean.
