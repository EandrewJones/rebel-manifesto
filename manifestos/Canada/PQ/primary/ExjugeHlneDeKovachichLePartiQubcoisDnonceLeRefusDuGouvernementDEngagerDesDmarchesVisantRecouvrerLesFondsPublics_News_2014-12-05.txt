Quebec- The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and sentence of the official opposition in terms of justice, Alexandre Cloutier, denounces the government's refusal to initiate approaches to recover the amount of more than $ 200,000 used by The former judge of the Quebec Administrative Court, Hélène de Kovachich, in a purely personal case. 
The Government of Quebec is engaged in a period of austerity that requires the population of many sacrifices. Meanwhile, he refuses to undertake any approach to recovering public funds unjustly used by the former Kovachich judge. "The least thing is that the Minister of Justice is due diligence in this case. The Council of Administrative Justice, as well as the Auditor General of Quebec, blame the use of public funds by Kovachich's Ex-Judge Hélène. Why does not the minister commit formal approaches to respond to these two investigative reports? Asked Alexander Cloutier. 
The Parti Québécois believes that the Government acts in the most complete inconsistency with regard to the recovery of the sums unfairly paid by the state. "On the one hand, the Minister of Justice tables a bill to recover the sums unfairly paid by the state in the granting of public contracts. But, on the other hand, it fully refuses to initiate any approach when it comes to being reimbursed fees paid unfairly by the Quebec Administrative Court. This two weights, two measures is unacceptable! , "Said Alexandre Cloutier. 
The spokesman requires the Minister of Justice that it ceases to procrastinate and immediately triggers a process to recover the sums unfairly used by Kovachich's former Judge Hélène. "It's a matter of fairness. The credibility of the government is at stake, "concluded the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
