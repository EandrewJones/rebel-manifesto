Quebec- The member for Taillon and sentence of the official objection to health and accessibility to care, Diane Lamarre, required Minister Gaétan that he withdrew the quotas in Bill 20, since already begins to feel the perverse effects; In particular, there is an increase in the exodus of doctors to the private. 
"By imposing quotas that dehumanize the practice of medicine and that reduce access to care for patients, the Minister of Health has already succeeded in creating an exodus of doctors to the private. He must recognize that he was mistaken and that the result goes against the needs of the population. The minister's senseless proposal does not respect physicians; These wish to pursue human practice, where they can take the time to meet each patient without having to go out their stopwatch or calculator. Why is the minister stretching to maintain quotas that are seen, already have a negative impact on the health network and access to care for patients? Diane Lamarre said. 
The numbers of the Quebec Health Insurance Régie are clear: between January 1 and April 17, 2015, 28 doctors, including 23 family physicians, have disaffiliated. It is more, in three months, that the annual average of the last 10 years, which is at 24. 
"What has been witnessing for five months, it's been at an exodus of doctors. These departures weaken the Quebec public health system and are directly caused by the quotas of the Minister Barrette. Already, Quebec is one of the few places in the world where there are fewer family physicians than specialists. The minister would like to promote private medicine that he would not do otherwise. If not his bill, the problem, how does it explain the increase in the number of physicians who have leaving the public network for five months? The minister must withdraw the quotas in Bill 20, "concluded Diane Lamarre.
