Quebec- The Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet denounces the attitude of the opposition parties who refused yesterday, at the National Assembly, to adopt The Principle of Law 37Visant to introduce a moratorium on certain activities related to the research or exploitation of natural gas in the Schist of the St. Lawrence Lowlands. 
"I live on a daily basis with the stake of shale gas in my own riding for years. I feel the fear of people, indignation in the way the industry and the Liberal government have treated them, and I'm worried about a serious confidence deficit to institutions. I committed to protecting the population and I will not abandon. The CAQ and the PLQ will be the only ones responsible for this refusal of the moratorium, and a revival temptation among the gas companies to consider a return on the ground, on our lands, "said Minister Blanchet. 
Deposited at the National Assembly on May 15, Bill 37 had to move an additional step towards its official adoption, or a detailed analysis in parliamentary committee, before returning to all partners for its final adoption. Recall that with the adoption of this bill, the licensing certificates issued would be suspended and that any new issue would be postponed until the National Assembly has adopted a comprehensive legislative framework on exploration and the Operation of gas resources. The maximum duration of the moratorium established by the bill is five years. 
Opposition members invoke the pretext that consultations must be kept before the summary of the adoption of principle, but that does not justify the interruption of the process leading to the adoption of a law requested by the Citizens of the St. Lawrence Lowlands. 
In his speech at the National Assembly, Minister Yves-François Blanchet asked, in vain, to the elected representatives of the opposition to put the interests of citizens before their partisan interests. "On behalf of the tens of thousands of people who walked in the streets, on behalf of the dozens of municipalities who have adopted regulations to protect himself, in the name of knowledge and science, I invite the opposition to have the Courage and simplicity to say: We will adopt the principle in order to consult with the citizens of Quebec for the adoption of a moratorium on shale gas. » 
Note that it is not exceptional to hold special consultations after the adoption of the principle of a bill. Over the past year, six bills have followed this procedure, totally legitimate on the part of a minority government that faces an opposition that seems to be decided to block the study of a bill. It is therefore for the sake of not unnecessarily conducting consultations involving time and money spending from several individuals or groups that the government proposes to conduct these particular consultations after the adoption of the principle. "We do not want to go to Bill 43 and lose valuable time to citizens, municipalities and experts," said Minister Blanchet. 
"What is the position of opposition deputies?" Questions the Minister Blanchet. Do they have no opinion on a moratorium on shale gas? Because wanting to wait to hear the groups before giving their position testifies to a lack of courage certain. » 
The CAQ, which promised a moratorium in its electoral platform in 2012, now adopts an ambivalent position with respect to this project. On the plateau of the show everyone talks about it, his leader, Mr. François Legault, said to himself against the moratorium by saying that such a project was "a signal that we send to the big companies that one n is not interested in Quebec. A few months later, he claimed, "It's a real moratorium where there is zero exploration, zero exploitation ... except some pilot projects where the Ministry of the Environment is there to monitor the work, accept the work before they are made "(duty, 11 August 2012). 
"By this bill, the Parti Québécois would fulfill a consensual commitment with a lot of rigor, with respect for the concerns of citizens. In this context, it is up to the PLQ and the CAQ to prove to us that they are first at the service of the population and not to the special interest service, "concluded the Blanchet minister.
