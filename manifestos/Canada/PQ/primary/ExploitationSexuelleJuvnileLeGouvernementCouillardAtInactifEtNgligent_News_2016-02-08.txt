Quebec- The Quebec Party spokesperson for women's status, Carole Poirier, and youth protection, Jean-François Lisée, denounced the inaction of the Couillard government in the issue of juvenile sexual exploitation. 
"One of the first government decisions on this issue, in 2014, was to refuse the police service of the City of Montreal for the financing of its mixed metropolitan squad to combat prostitution and trafficking, unveiled. Mr. Lisée. The end of non-reception was motivated by purely budgetary reasons. » 
The SPVM also participated in the Interdepartmental Committee on these issues set up by the Government of the Parti Québécois and had presented the "main gaps" and the "means to be implemented" to tackle problems. From September 2013 to February 2014, 261 groups were heard and recommendations were formulated. The National Assembly had unanimously voted a motion denouncing trafficking and demanding an action plan. 
Carole Poirier explained that "the Couillard government received this report upon arrival to the government in April 2014. He could have rely on the recommendations he contained to deploy a positive action. On the contrary, he decided to leave the recommendations on a tablet. The report has never been made public and we had no continuation. " 
"All stakeholders were preparing for great mobilization and actions against juvenile prostitution when the Liberal Party took power. They were very disappointed that it was not a priority for the Liberal government, "said Poirier. "We lost two years," said Lisée. 
MPs ask the government to immediately make the report immediately and indicate how it intends to give rapidly following the recommendations. "The refusal of the Liberals to give the SPVM the means to act is in addition to their decision to cut the budget of the youth centers of $ 20 million a year and reduce by 20% the sums allocated to the organizations struggling on the ground. Against the influence of street gangs, denounced Jean-François Lisée. The government must restore these amounts immediately and deploy an even more consistent effort in the short term. »
