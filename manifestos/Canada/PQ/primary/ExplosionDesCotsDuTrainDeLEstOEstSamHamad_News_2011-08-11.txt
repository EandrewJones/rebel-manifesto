Montreal - "This morning, the press revealed that in January 2011, the Minister of Transport, Sam Hamad, was informed by the Metropolitan Transportation Agency of a revised assessment at 665 million of the cost of the East Train. The Minister has authorized the continuation of the project for commissioning in the fall of 2012. Eight months later, the President of the Treasury Board, Michelle Courchesne, announces that she puts a brake on the project. " Is there a pilot on the plane? Does the right hand know what the left hand does in this government? "," Said the official opposition spokesperson for Transport and Deputy of Gouin, Nicolas Girard. 
The member for Gouin demanded that the Minister of Transport provide explanations for the population on this new Liberal caduorage in the management of major projects. He demanded total transparency. "After the chum saga, the Tunnel City-Marie incident, citizens once again pay the price of Liberal Lax. Minister Hamad had promised the population of Eastern Montreal and the Repentigny, Mascouche and Terrebonne sectors the commissioning of the East Train in 2012. Now not only do citizens teach today an explosion Project costs by 70%, but in addition the train will not be ready before 2013, "said the member for Gouin. 
The official opposition spokesman deplores that many citizens of the Lanaudière region and Montreal will once again have to arrify patience and spend long hours in traffic caps. "Liberal amateurism is expensive to taxpayers and québec motorists," concluded the member for Gouin.
