Quebec- The member for Jonquière and the official opposition spokeswoman in sustainable development and the environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, wishes to reaffirm that the government of the Parti Québécois has accepted that Quebec be considered a simple Highway for the export of Alberta oil without the Quebeckers perceive profits. 
"The debate on the passage of the west oil on the territory of Quebec will not settle by the issuance of a certificate of authorization. The decision is not administrative: it is political. He will always come back to Quebeckers to decide what spends on their territory and what their environmental and energy future will look like, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
According to the member, the Prime Minister tries to make diversion because he has accepted the passage of the Superprétroliers on the St. Lawrence River, even as British Columbia and the United States refuse. 
"The Liberal government accepts without broning that the St. Lawrence River becomes a highway for the export of Alberta oil. Philippe Couillard has even locked Quebec in the Canadian Energy Strategy, without consulting Quebeckers. The only consultation he did, it was with Stephen Harper, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
"In light of the current information on the issues of safety and protection of the environment, a government government has suspended the certificate of authorization granted to the company Kildair and invited Quebeckers to a public debate on our future Energy, what the Couillard Government does not make unconditional accepting the passage of Alberta oil in Quebec, "concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
