Sorel-Tracy - the candidate of the Parti Québécois in the riding of Richelieu, Élaine Zakaïb, is scandalized by the decision of the federal government to expel a resident of Portuguese origin of Saint-Roch-de-Richelieu, Mr. Jose Pereira. "Located in Quebec for more than 30 years, Mr. Pereira has been married to a French-speaking Quebec, he had his children in Quebec who, in turn, had children. In his case, we do not even speak more integration, he joined in 1980! Exclaimed the candidate of the Quebecois party. 
"The Conservative government is removing any kind of humanity in its immigration rules. He breaks a family, strives in their lives and causes a tragedy. In the name of what? An administrative imbroglio! You have to be rendered low. The Government of Canada behaves in real life, "Slain Zakaïb sentenced. 
"It needs to stop. I ask all parties to put pressure on the federal government, beyond partisanship, to prevent the extradition of Mr. Pereira. We must act quickly, "she added, inviting all the candidates from Richelieu to put pressure on the Minister of Immigration. 
"The Liberals are still in power, at least for a few weeks. They act! What Canada is doing to a Quebecker is outrageous, ignoble and contrary to all the values of Quebec society. We must quickly give us a country, but in the meantime, prevent this injustice, "concluded Élain Zakaïb.
