These projects were analyzed and selected according to the criteria of the support program for sports and recreational facilities - Phase II of the Fund for the Development of Sport and Physical Activity, which provides maximum financial assistance equivalent to half of the Eligible costs. 
It should be noted that these investments are planned as part of the Government of Quebec's economic policy, employment priority, recently presented by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau.

The realization of these projects should allow the creation of about 3,500 jobs.

We do even more today, determined to increase the level of physical activity and improve the physical condition of Quebeckers. By investing heavily in our sports and recreational infrastructures, we stimulate economic development while contributing to the health, well-being and quality of life. In my view, these are strong and responsible gestures, "Malavoy said.
