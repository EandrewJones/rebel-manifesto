Laurierville- The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr. Fran√ßois Gendron, is proud to participate in the inauguration of the Quebec Canadian Federation Warehouse, in Laurierville. 
"This factory-warehouse will allow you to continue your collective efforts to ensure sound management of the Maple Syrup Strategic Reserve. This reserve is a real treasure that is a solid foundation for your industry, "said the minister. 
The warehouse plant has been erected to meet the needs of space for the Maple Syrup Strategic Reserve. To support the construction of this building, the Quebec Canadian Producer Federation has benefited from nearly $ 394,000 financial assistance from provincial and federal governments. 
"Maple syrup and all its derivatives occupy a place of choice in our food offer. These are distinctive products that are linked to both our heritage and the extraordinary spirit of innovation that characterizes Quebecers. In fact, this is exactly what I have in mind when I think about the strong identity of Quebec's food, which represents one of the four axes of our food sovereignty policy, "said Francois Gendron.
