Quebec- The member for Duplessis and spokesman for the Nordic Development Party, Lorraine Richard, denounces the abandonment of the North Coast by the Liberal government. "The North Plan is one of the most resounding failures of the current Liberal government," she said. 
"On the North Shore, the balance sheet is disastrous. There was the bankruptcy of Natural Resources Cliffs, the abandonment of the Ferroatl√°ntica Silicon Factory Project, the Lighting Mine Arnaud and the Reduction of the Rio Tinto Minor Activities in Havre-Saint-Pierre. To add this morning we learned that ArcelorMittal will reduce its activities as early as 2020 and could close completely in 2030, as a result of the announcement of the undefined postponement of a critical investment in the pursuit of the activities of the mine. It is nearly 2500 direct jobs, especially in Port Cartier and Fermont, who will be lost at this time. However, the survival of these communities involves the maintenance of ArcelorMittal's activities, "also exposed the member for Duplessis. 
"It's the hecatomb on the North Shore, and the government has no economic recovery and diversification plan. This region is empty of its population four times faster than any other region in Quebec. The unemployment rate reached 11% last April. The level of worry is already very high and this announcement has nothing to reassure families. Yet the government is aware of the situation. It must act concretely to ensure the survival of ArcelorMittal's facilities in Port Cartier and Fermont, in order to ensure a dynamic future in the region. I also invite him to reflect urgency to a real Nordic development plan that takes into account the importance of economic diversification, so that the region can cope with the hollows of the mining cycle. The main flaw in the Liberal North Plan, it is precisely to have expected only the ups of this cycle, "concluded Lorraine Richard.
