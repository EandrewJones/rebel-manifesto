Rehabilitation Center in Intellectual Disabilities and Invasive Disorders of Montreal Development. 
"While the Gaétan Barrette Ministers and Lucie Charlebois claim that Bill 10, adopted under gag, has no effect on the services, we find the opposite again. These residences are essential for people already vulnerable. These and their families learn that they will deprive them of services or will be transferred to private intermediate resources. The Liberal government has no mandate to privatize services to the people, "said Jean-François Lisée. 
The hon. Member recalls that these cups are added to those already observed, especially by the Protector of the Citizen, on waiting times for young people with a spectrum disorder of autism. "Waiting times are unacceptable for these young people. The compressions of 600 million in the health network in 2015-2016 hurt. The budget for services in intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders has been increased by only 0.74%, which is concretely reflected in service cuts in institutions, "he added.
