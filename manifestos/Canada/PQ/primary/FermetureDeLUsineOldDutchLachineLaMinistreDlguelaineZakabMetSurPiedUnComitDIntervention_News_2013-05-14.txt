Montréal- On the announcement, on May 6, the closure of the Old Dutch plant in Lachine, which will result in the loss of more than 200 jobs, the Minister Delegate to Industrial Policy and the Quebec Economic Development Bank , Mrs. ÉLAINE ZAKAB, set up an intervention committee to try to convince the US company to maintain its Quebec subsidiary.  Formed of representatives of Investissement Québec, the Ministry of Finance and the Economy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the City of Montreal and Montreal International, this committee aims to concert the efforts to maximize the chances of success. 
"I can assure you that we will explore all the possible avenues to get the company to give up closure, while respecting our responsible investment criteria," said Minister Zakaïb's delegate. 
The Quebec government has already started discussions with Old Dutch to find a solution to avoid the closure of the plant, which would take place next September. 
Deputy Minister Zakaïb also urged the collaboration of the member for Marquette, Mr. François Ouimet. "When it comes to saving jobs, partisanship has no place," said the delegated minister. "I am pleased to see that all the actors involved are willing to work together to try to find a short-term solution and save jobs in play."
