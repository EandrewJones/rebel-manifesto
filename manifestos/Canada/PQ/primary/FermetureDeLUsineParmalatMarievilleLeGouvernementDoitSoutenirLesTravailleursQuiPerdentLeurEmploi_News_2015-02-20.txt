"More than 90 workers are now unemployed. We want the government to make every effort to support Parmalat and its employees. Our region, Montérégie, loses a factory; More than 90 families meet with a significant loss of income. Employment-Québec must be available to help them, especially workers who will not be relocated, "said Dave Turcotte. 
"What did the government do to try to support the business and avoid the closure of the Marieville plant? Since when was he aware? What will he do to help workers? Without economic policy, the government is sailing, which has adverse effects on our businesses, "added Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"Again, the Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, remained inactive, dropping the environment of agriculture and the agri-food sector. The dairy industry represents more than $ 5 billion for the Quebec economy. It is therefore essential to maintain transformation jobs to ensure the future of the sector, "concluded André Villeneuve.
