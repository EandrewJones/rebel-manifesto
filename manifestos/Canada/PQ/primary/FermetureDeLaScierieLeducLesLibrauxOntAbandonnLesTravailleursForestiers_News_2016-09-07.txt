Quebec- The hon. Member for Bonaventure and spokesman for the Quebec of Forests, Sylvain Roy, stands for himself solidarity of the 75 workers of the Leduc Sawmill of Quebec who will lose their job on October 28, and the Government to find solutions to find solutions sustainable to the enduring crisis in the forestry sector. 
"Once again, the government abandons workers! In this factory, 70% of employees are between 35 and 40 years of seniority, which will not facilitate the task when it comes time to find a new job. In addition, for these workers, no relocation is possible. It's a real drama! The government must deploy its resources to help them, "said Sylvain Roy. 
"The new Minister of Forests, Luc Blanchette, who has remained silent since his appointment, more than two weeks ago, must tell us what he will do to help not only those workers, but also all of our forest industry . As we know, the negotiations that come from them with the Americans, about the new resinist timber agreement, will be particularly arduous. In this context, every new factory closure weakens Quebec's position. The minister must ensure that negotiations will not hurt Quebec companies. More than 30,000 jobs have been lost in the last 10 years in the forest industry; This situation can not continue! Solutions must be put in place quickly, "concluded Sylvain Roy.
