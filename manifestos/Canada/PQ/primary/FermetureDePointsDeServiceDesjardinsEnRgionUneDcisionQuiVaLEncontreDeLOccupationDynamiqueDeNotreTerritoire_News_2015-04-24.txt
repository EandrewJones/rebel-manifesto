Quebec- The member for Gaspé and official opposition on the development of the regions, Gaétan Lelièvre, as well as the member for Berthier, André Villeneuve, deplored the decision of the Desjardins movement to close his points of service in Holy -Batrix and Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare. 
"We join our voices to that of mayors, as well as that of the two national organizations representing the municipalities, the UMQ and the FQM. This way of doing things goes against the principle of the dynamic occupation of our territory. With destructive liberal policies, this decision of the Desjardins Movement is added to a long list of bad news for the regions, "said Gaétan Lelièvre. 
The hon. Member else recalls that these closures are added to those in Buckland, Saint-Philemon and Saint-Nazaire in Bellechasse. 
"Sainte-Beatrix and Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, two municipalities in the riding of Berthier, as many others located in the regions, mobilize to safeguard their development tools. The closure of their points of service could have several negative effects, starting with the economic devitalization of these communities. People, now forced to make their financial transactions in neighboring villages, may be tempted to also do their current purchases, which would greatly affect local trade, "added André Villeneuve.
