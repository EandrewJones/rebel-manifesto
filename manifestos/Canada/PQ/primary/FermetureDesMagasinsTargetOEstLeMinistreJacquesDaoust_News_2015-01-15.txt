Quebec- The member for Saint-Jérôme and sentence of the official opposition in the field of economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, is concerned about the consequences of closure, in Quebec, of all stores in the Target chain. He wishes to support women and men who will soon lose their jobs. 
"Everything must be implemented to help workers in this difficult period. Let us remember that since the coming to the power of the Liberal Party, Quebec has lost 35,900 full-time jobs! The government continues its inaction and has no economic policy or support for job creation. He must wake up and set up a real economic plan; That it ceases to reduce tax credits to businesses that create employment, and put in place a real support strategy and creation of SMEs! "Claimed Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"After Jacob and Mexx, the difficulties of the retail sector are continuing in Quebec. The whole population is obliged to question the future of the industry and that of its workers. A question is, however, more urgent: what does the minister of the economy, innovation and exports do, Jacques Daoust, whereas closures and job losses accumulate? What does he mean to support the retail trade? ", Concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
