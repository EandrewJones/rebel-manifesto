Quebec, April 3, 2020 - Lorraine Richard, Member of Parliament for Duplessis and spokesperson for the public safety party, relays a growing number of votes claiming to protect roadblocks supposed to protect the propagation of COVID -19. 
IN SHORT 
From day to day, the situation becomes more and more chaotic. "The goal is to reduce travel. But if a checkpoint is in place only four hours a day, it does not give the expected results, "said Lorraine Richard. 
It is necessary to adapt to the reality of each territory, of course, but public health and public safety must relay a coherent message, so that the instructions are well followed by the population. 
For now, however, the guidelines are unclear. In many places, elected officials are outdated. "Because they want to protect their community, some take the initiative to close access to their municipality. In addition, people continue to circulate from one MRC to another; The police have awareness, they do not have the power to block the move to anyone, "illustrated the member. 
"Close regions, it was the thing to do. My colleagues from the Parti Québécois and I welcomed this decision of the government, and we reiterate that we remain there to relay its messages. But we have to do things properly, taking into account the concerns of people and the particularities of each region. The instructions must be clear, and the resources to apply them, available, "concluded Lorraine Richard.
