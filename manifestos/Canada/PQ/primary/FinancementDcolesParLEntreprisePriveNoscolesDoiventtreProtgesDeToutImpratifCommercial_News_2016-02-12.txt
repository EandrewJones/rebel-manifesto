Qu√©bec- The Quebec Party spokesperson in education, research and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, invites the Liberal government to assume its responsibilities in funding our public schools and clarifying the rules surrounding donations. Private companies, so that philanthropy is never attached to conditions inconsistent with the mission of the school. 
"Faced with the disengagement of the Liberal government, schools have no choice but to turn to external sources of funding. It is a worrying situation, which opens the door to important drifts with regard to the independence of our schools, "raised Alexander Cloutier. 
The hon. Member for Lac-Saint-Jean reacted a $ 20,000 donation by a private foundation at Charles-Gravelic High School of Chicoutimi for the modernization of his library. In return, the school is committed to promoting the sale of tickets for a private draw organized by the Foundation, up to $ 10,000. 
"Philanthropy is a good thing. Good if companies give money to our public schools. However, this should not be conditional on some lift feeder. In this case, we are in partly refiling an invoice of $ 10,000 to parents. It raises serious questions, "said Alexandre Cloutier. 
The spokesperson recalls that the law on public education explicitly provides that a school can not "solicit or receive donations to which conditions are associatable in inconsistent with the mission of the school, including conditions relating to any form. solicitation of commercial nature ". 
"The Minister of Education must play his role. First, it must ensure adequate funding to our schools, to avoid as much as possible to use external sources of funding. And, secondly, it must impose clear tags about the relationship between schools and private companies. If there is an area that must be independent of any commercial imperative in Quebec, it is that of education, primary and secondary schools, "concluded the member.
