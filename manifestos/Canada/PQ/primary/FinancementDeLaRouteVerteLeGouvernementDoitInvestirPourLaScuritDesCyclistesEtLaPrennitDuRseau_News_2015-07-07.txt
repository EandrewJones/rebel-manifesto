Québec bike today published a series of recommendations to try to save this internationally recognized Quebec jewel. The government must follow up as soon as possible, "said Martine Ouellet. 
"By this decision, the Liberals turn their backs at more than 20 years of efforts from the regions, civil society, municipalities and the Government of Quebec to develop a more than profitable cycling network for communities that welcome thousands of cyclists each year. On behalf of austerity, this government makes decisions without vision and ignores the many positive impacts of this network, particularly on security, good lifestyle and regional tourism development, "said Sylvain Pagé.

"The safety of cyclists passes not only by the maintenance of the green road, but also by a major overhaul of the road safety code. The Parti Québécois supports the establishment of a mandatory buffer zone of a meter between motorists and cyclists, as proposed by bike Québec. We will closely follow the code changes so that cyclist safety is a must, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
