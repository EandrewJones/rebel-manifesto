IN SHORT 
Since the last budget, when it comes to the funding of community organizations, the minister plays on words. She has once again been done today. "Lucie Charlebois says and reiterated that the rise is $ 80 million over 5 years, but it's wrong: it's a cumulative sums. In truth, funding for community organizations will be increased by only $ 25 million over 5 years. The government maintains the blur in order to appear, but we will not let them be fooled. Organizations denounced this creative accounting, too, and we will continue to do it, "said Dave Turcotte. 
"This morning, the Liberal government worsened to have accumulated surpluses in the coffers of the state. Well, these should be used to enhance funding from community organizations! Twenty-five million, it's very little. On our side, we are committed to enhancing the funding of the Autonomous Community Action Agency Mission from all sectors, recalled the spokesperson. The environment has suffered enough from liberal austerity. » 
The Parti Québécois has committed to enhance the financing of the Autonomous Community Action Agency Mission of all sectors of recurring and cumulative $ 60 million for three years: $ 60 million in the first year, $ 120 million The following year and $ 180 million the third year. The financing of organizations will be multi-year, more stable and will be indexed annually for all autonomous Community action agencies.
