Quebec, on January 20, 2017- In light of the information obtained by some media, the spokesman of the Parti Québécois on transport, Alain Therrien, denounces the opacity of the government with respect to the financing of the metropolitan electricity network (REM), as well as its refusal to listen to the warnings of the BAPE. 
"Everything indicates that the BAPE report will confirm the many doubts raised by Quebeckers and several economists about the profitability of the project led by the CDPQ infra. Contrary to what the government affirms, questioning the profitability and funding of such a project is certainly not an "ideological" bias, but rather common sense, "said the spokesman. 
"It is the government that acts by blindness electoralist by imposing the realization of its electoral promise at all costs to the Caisse de Depé, and ignoring the financial risks for its applicants, taxpayers and municipalities. Let us remember that the Infra CDPQ had been annoyed to be interviewed in this regard by the BAPE. What is she trying to hide? ", Also questioned the member. 
"The Infra CDPQ, which has never operated on such a transit network, has a return obligation to Quebec savers. However, no existing public transit company in North America is currently profitable. Who will pay the note to reconcile the two realities? Already, we know that Hydro-Québec will have to subsidize the project. That's not what was planned! ", he added. 
"The Parti Québécois will hang the government in order to obtain clear answers on the financing of the REM. We will ensure that the invoice will not be refiled to taxpayers and municipalities in the Montreal area, while the COPN CDPQ plans to sell half of its participation in the project. We will not let public subsidies enrich private investors. The government must provide answers to Quebecers, "concluded Alain Therrien.
