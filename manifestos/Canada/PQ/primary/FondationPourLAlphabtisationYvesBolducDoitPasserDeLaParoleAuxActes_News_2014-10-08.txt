Quebec- The member for Saint-Jean and the official opposition spokesperson for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, asks the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport Yves Bolduc, to go beyond words and give the necessary funding to avoid the closure of the Foundation for Literacy. 
"After his unfortunate statement on books and school libraries, the Minister of Education wanted to be forgiven. On September 8, during a prize ceremony as part of the International Literacy Day, he stressed the vital importance of the Foundation. Informed of its financial difficulties, then committed to unlock financing and pay it before September 30th. Yves Bolduc met today the representatives of the foundation but, visibly, they leave Quebec without any guarantee, "lamented Dave Turcotte. 
The spokesperson recalls that the foundation helps 10,000 people a year to overcome illiteracy. It leads this fight by relying on volunteer help from several personalities that recognize the importance of the problem. The Foundation also set up the "gift reading" program, which offered 40,000 pounds to children and disadvantaged families. 
"Minister Yves Bolduc reiterated his commitment to the National Assembly today. Despite this, nothing concrete has been said or done. Can he speech speech and confirm, in writing, the amount of funding and the date on which he will be awarded to the Foundation? ", Concluded the hon. Member for Saint John.
