Quebec- Minister Aboriginal Affairs Minister, Ms. Elizabeth Larouche, announces a $ 475,000 grant to the Innue Mashteuiatsh community, the Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan, to participate in important consultations initiated by the Ministry of Natural Resources and The Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks. 
"In order to establish a relationship that is constructive and partnership-oriented, the government has mutually satisfactory consultation mechanisms with communities. These must also be used to know the concerns that Aboriginal communities can have, "said the minister. 
The financial assistance granted will make consultations on different projects related to energy, mines, territories, wildlife and forest. Some consultations are directly related to the wind farm projects of Rivière-du-Moulin, the seigniory of Beaupré and Saint-Gédéon, as well as with the hydroelectric project of the 11th of the Mistassini River. 
"The Pekuakamiulnuatsh wishes to be an integral part of Quebec's major economic development projects, it is fundamental that the Mashteuiatsh community is partner in the development of natural resources," said Denis Trottier, MP from Roberval. 
This is the fifth year that financial assistance is renewed for the community of Mashteuiatsh, through the Aboriginal Aboriginal Aboriginal Initiatives II Fund (SAA). This fund provides for the financing of the participation of nations or indigenous communities in consultation processes initiated by the Government of Quebec, up to $ 20 million over five years. This envelope aims to facilitate the implementation of the constitutional obligation, which is the responsibility of the Government of Quebec, to consult the indigenous communities. The Aboriginal Initiatives Fund supports projects with positive spin-offs in Aboriginal communities.
