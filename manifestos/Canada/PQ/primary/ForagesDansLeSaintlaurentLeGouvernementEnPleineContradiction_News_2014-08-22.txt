Quebec- The member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesman in sustainable development and the environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, and the member for Marie-Victorin and spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, denounce the double speech of the Liberals in TransCanada's file. Behind the closed doors, the government has indeed authorized boreholes in the marine environment, off Cacouna, even before waiting for the start of the work of the office of public hearings on the environment (BAPE), which it nevertheless has Herself announced. 
"The Minister of the Environment lets go the drilling in the St. Lawrence Estuary, even though BAPE has not yet started its work or recommendations. Its duty is to protect wildlife and habitats, not protect the agenda of TransCanada. By doing so, the minister confirms that he gives no credibility to the environmental assessment procedure, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
The Parti Québécois requires Minister David Heurtel to immediately make scientific advice of his department and those of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, on which he supports his decision to grant a certificate of authorization. 
Liberal transparency does not exist 
MEPs also point out that it is thanks to the action of the Parti Québécois that the government has consented to hold a specific BAPE on the entire energy pipeline project is. 
"In reality, today, the government exactly adopts the same attitude as the 2010 Liberal government in Shale Gas Record: Total Improvisation and Contempt of Environmental Impacts. The presumed transparency promised by the Liberal government simply does not exist, "pursued Bernard Drainville. 
It should be remembered that last May TransCanada did not obtain a certificate of authorization from the Ministry of the Environment to move forward with geophysical surveys, due to the issuance of contaminants in the St. Laurent who would threaten the restoration of the beluga population.
