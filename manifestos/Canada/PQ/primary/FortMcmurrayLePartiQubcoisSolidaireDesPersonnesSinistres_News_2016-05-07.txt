Quebec- The member for Jonquière and Acting Head of the Parti Québécois Parliament Wing, Sylvain Gaudreault, wanted to express his solidarity to the many people experienced by Fort McMurray's tragedy. 
"On behalf of the Québécois Party, I express my compassion and my support for the victims following this major natural disaster. Our thoughts are with the displaced Alberta families, who had to leave their homes quickly, being worried about their property, their use, their memories and their future. I have a thought also for all Quebec workers and elsewhere in Canada who earn their lives in Fort McMurray. I thank for their dedication, firefighters, police, paramedics and other members of the emergency services that support the population in these difficult times. I am convinced that the generosity of Quebeckers, already experienced in their history by natural disasters, will be at the rendezvous to support the people of Alberta, "said Sylvain Gaudreault.
