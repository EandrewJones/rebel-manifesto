Qu√©bec- The hon. Member for Bonaventure and Forest Opposition Spokesman, Sylvain Roy, denounces the lack of support from the Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, Laurent Lessard, Quebec Forest Owners. Yesterday, before the delegates gathered on the occasion of the Annual Congress of the Forest Forester Federation of Quebec, in Saint-Georges, he urged the Minister to announce concrete measures favoring the economy of the private forest. 
"The Minister must speech the acts and propose support measures to the 130,000 lot owners and the 35,000 forest producers in all regions of Quebec. The situation of the business environment, already difficult, is aggravated by the austerity measures imposed by the Liberal government. Among other things, the abolition of the forest creation program and silvicultural investment program affects hard forests. However, these have an urgent need for job creative investments in the regions of Quebec, "said Sylvain Roy. 
The spokesperson does not understand that the minister asks the private foresters to produce more wood to deliver, while decreasing their budgets by almost 30%. "There is a total inconsistency between the effort required for foresters and the support granted to them. How could they do more with less? Government assistance must take into account the reality of forest producers, for whom the context is difficult. But with the cuts he currently imposes, the Liberal government does exactly the opposite, "concluded the hon. Member for Bonaventure.
