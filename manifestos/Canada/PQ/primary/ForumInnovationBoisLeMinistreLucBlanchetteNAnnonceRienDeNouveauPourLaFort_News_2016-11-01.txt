Quebec, November 1, 2016 -The spokesperson for the Quebecois Forest Party, Sylvain Roy, regrets that the Wood Innovation Forum, who was held yesterday in the Rivi√®re du Loup, did not result in anything again for the Forest economy. 
"In 2013, Quebec's Prime Minister Pauline Marois, had held the national rendezvous of the Quebec Forest, in the presence of all the stakeholders in the forest sector. Three major projects had been set up, and investments of $ 675 million had been announced. The Liberal government, arriving in power, has thrown everything to the trash and, now, two and a half years later, it announces nothing new. It is frankly disappointing for the actors of the forest sector, "said Sylvain Roy. 
Private forests The spokesperson also deplores that nothing else yesterday affects the 130,000 private forest owners. "The government totally neglects the private forest. The conclusion of yesterday's forum proves it once again, "he added. 
Wood Charter "With this government, the forest sector has already lost two and a half years. Ads from the Wood Innovation Forum demonstrate that the Liberals have still not developed vision as to this area of activity. A good idea would be to start by reuniting the wood chart, which was supported by all the actors and who represented a real innovation, "concluded Sylvain Roy.
