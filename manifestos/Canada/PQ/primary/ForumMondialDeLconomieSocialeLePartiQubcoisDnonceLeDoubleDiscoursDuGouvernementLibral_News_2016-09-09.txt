Montreal, September 9, 2016 - The Liberal government is worth the merits of the social economy, the hon. Member for Rimouski and the Quebec's Word of the Seniors as well as in the area of social economy, Harold Lebel, denounces the Granting by the Integrated Health and Social Services Center of Laval of a one million dollar contract to a private company to provide home care. 
"The private sector grants wages lower to employees who give home care. Is it acceptable that most of the time, we offer attendants who take care of our home elders from lower wages, while allowing private companies to make a profit? The $ 242 million of cuts in the health and social services network, imposed by Gaétan barrette, force institutions to make choices that can compromise the quality of care and services offered to patients; It's unacceptable, "said the spokesman. 
"The Liberals say one thing and do its opposite: the governmental action plan in 2015-2020 social economy planned measures to encourage social economy companies to participate more actively in tenders of public procurement. But it is exactly the opposite that occurs. Nevertheless, the Liberals dare to appear at the World Forum of the Social Economy, claiming to contribute, while they affect him with their austerity measures, "continued the hon. Member for Rimouski. 
"The World Forum of the Social Economy has nevertheless been a success! In addition, his outfit in Montreal made Quebec shine. The story proves it: the Parti Québécois has always been the party of the social economy in Quebec. And it will be in the future too, "concluded Harold Lebel.
