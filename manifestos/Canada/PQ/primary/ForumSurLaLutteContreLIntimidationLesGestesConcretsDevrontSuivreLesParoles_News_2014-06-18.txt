Quebec- The member for Terrebonne and the Official Opposition Spokesman on Family and Fighting Bullying, Mathieu Traversy, welcomes the next outfit of a forum on the fight against intimidation and wishes to mention that He will be present to ensure that the voice of the population and people who have lived intimidation is heard. These demand measures, and the member ensures his collaboration and vigilance so that concrete actions are undertaken. 
"I intend to actively participate in future forum discussions. The question is important; That's why I invite the people to share their opinions. Intimidation, it affects everyone, at any age, in the real world as in the virtual world, and it is without a doubt a scourge to attack collectively, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
"A real concertation of the population, organizations and stakeholders is beneficial; It is still necessary that it quickly leads to tangible steps after the forum, he continued. My colleagues and I will therefore be particularly vigilant so that the actions follow the word and the reflection, and for the resources to be quickly deployed in all regions of Quebec. Â» 
The Forum will take place on October 2, 2014 and will bring together all partners engaged in the fight against bullying, in addition to the ministries concerned. The population will also be called upon to enrich its work.
