Quebec- The hon. Member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, noted the Prime Minister's thrust, which today dissougued the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Yves Bolduc. 
"During the question period, the Prime Minister excluded naked excavations, what his minister refused for three days. The last statement of the Minister of Education in the girl's case who suffered a search by the direction of his school once again confirmed what Quebeckers have understood for several months already: Yves Bolduc should no longer to be Minister of Education. His last blunder took a new dimension, internationally, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
"An independent investigator must now look into the case, since the Minister of Education is still unable to do his job. In Quebec, everyone, except the Prime Minister, agrees that Bolduc Ins have no credibility. Indeed, the episode of nude excavations is added to many other examples by prove: the generous premiums he has never reimbursed, his statement on books in schools, the cuts in the Assistance to homework, DIY of school commission mergers, the abandonment of hat competitions, girls! and secondary in show ... When will Philippe Couillard understand that his minister of education must leave his position? Will he finally confess that Bolduc exhibits has become a burden for Quebec and the education system? "Concluded Stéphane Bédard.
