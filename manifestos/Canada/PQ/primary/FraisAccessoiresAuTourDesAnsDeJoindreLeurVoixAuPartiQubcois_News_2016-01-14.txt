Québec- The member for Taillon and spokesperson for the Quebecois health and accessibility of care, Diane Lamarre, and the hon. Member for Richelieu and spokesperson for seniors, Sylvain Rochon, said today the mobilization Unprecedented eight groups representing more than half a million seniors to denounce expense billing accessories to patients. 
"While the Auditor General taught us a few weeks ago that doctors have pocketed $ 800 million, it is absolutely indecent that the Liberal government does not come back to its decision and that it authorizes the coming physicians additional 50 million in patient pockets. In fact, Bill 20 was adopted on November 10, 2015, but the list of incidental fees that can be billed has still not been made public. What does the minister negotiate with medical federations? Quebeckers have the right to have the right time; The consensus on eight groups representing seniors clearly demonstrates that incidental costs are really harmful to citizens, "said Diane Lamarre. 
The Québécois Party denounces for several months the sneaky maneuver by the Minister Barrette, consisting of amending Bill 20 to enable his colleagues to legally charge patient overloads, including seniors. Remember that the eight groups that today denounce the incorporating fees add to the fourteen others who have repeatedly asked the Minister of Health to retreat and take the physician remuneration envelope the 50 million in question. 
"Several seniors are in a vulnerability situation or have few means. For them, overloads for care or services will be a major obstacle to access and force them to make choices, sometimes even at the expense of their health. In some cases, the taxation of incidentals can make the difference between receiving care or do not receive it. Today, the Minister of Health must hear their heart cry and give up charging them to enrich doctors, who have already had more than their share of the cake, "concluded Sylvain Rochon.
