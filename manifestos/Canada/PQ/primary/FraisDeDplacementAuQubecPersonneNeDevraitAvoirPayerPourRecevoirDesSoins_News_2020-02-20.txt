Quebec, on 20 February 2020 - several members of the Parti Québécois, including the spokesperson for health, Joël Arseneau (Islands-de-la-Madeleine), as well as Sylvain Roy (Bonaventure), Megan Perry Melançon (Gaspé), Lorraine Richard (Duplessis) and Martin Ouellet (René-Lévesque), all from the regions, claimed that the benefits received by patients - and their escorts - to move out of their region of origin to receive specialized care . 
IN SHORT 
"Currently, the benefits offered to people to move to receive specialized care is derisory," said Lorraine Richard. For example, they are only $ 0.13 per km, $ 12.75 per day for meals, and $ 75 per night. Obviously, these amounts do not cover all expenses incurred, far from it. » 
"In comparison, officials to move for their work receive $ 0.47 per km and doctors, $ 0.86. For meals, we are talking about $ 46.25 a day for officials. It's three times more! Why this standard double? Asked megan Perry Melançon. 
Sylvain Roy has argued that the current situation created, in addition to manifest iniquity between regions and major centers, unfortunate situations. "To receive care, people have to make heartbreaking choices. Give up taking a vacation. Groove their pension fund. Yet they pay their taxes, like everyone else. » 
On the other hand, in its current form, the program that manages these allowances draws its budgets on the regional centers (CISS and CIUSS). "This way of proceeding is counterproductive. Compensation should have their own envelope. Therefore, in addition to the improvement of allowances, we ask the Government to create a program entirely devoted to these compensation, with its own budget, "insisted Joël Arseneau. 
"Either the specialized care is made in all regions or we adequately compensate people who have to move to receive. Nobody should have to pay to get treatment. In Quebec, it can not be otherwise, "concluded Martin Ouellet.
