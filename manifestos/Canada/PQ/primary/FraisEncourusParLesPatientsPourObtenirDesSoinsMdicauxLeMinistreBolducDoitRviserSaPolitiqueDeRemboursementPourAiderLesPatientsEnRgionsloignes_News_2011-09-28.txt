Quebec - "Every day, people in need of specialized health care must move to another region for health care medically required. However, if a person lives within 250 kilometers of the place where she will be treated, she will have to pay the travel expenses herself to be treated. It is time for the Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, reviews this rule that represents a brake on access to health care ". 
This is what the member for Taschereau and spokesman of the Official Opposition on Health, Agnès Maltese, today at the National Assembly, said after questioning Minister Bolduc. The members of Jonquière and Duplessis, Sylvain Gaudreault and Lorraine Richard, also intervened to demand the minister that he moves quickly. 
According to an internal note that circulates at the Ministry of Health and Social Services, it is confirmed that if the eligibility standard for reimbursements was established 200 kilometers, while it is currently 250 kilometers, there is considerably increased access to health care. It is estimated at 13,000 the number of additional trips that could be reimbursed at an estimated cost of $ 2.1 million. 
The member for Duplessis, Lorraine Richard, gave the example that in Havre-Saint-Pierre pregnant women must do more than 230 kilometers, at their expense, to go to seven-Îles to have access to an ultrasound. . "This is a real example that many women live on the North Shore. It must also happen elsewhere in Quebec, "said Lorraine Richard. 
"For more than a year, I have been relentlessly interfering with Minister Bolduc to modify the norm. This is a question of basic equity: residents of remote areas do not have to pay more for health care, they are already paying enough taxes and taxes. Minister Bolduc has already in hand the studies necessary for decision-making. It is expected to pass quickly to action, "concluded the member for Jonquière, Sylvain Gaudreault.
