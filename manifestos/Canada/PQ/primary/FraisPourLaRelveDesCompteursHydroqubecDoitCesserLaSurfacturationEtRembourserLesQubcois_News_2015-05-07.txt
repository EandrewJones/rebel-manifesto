Quebec- The member for Marie-Victorin and the official opposition to the energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, sum the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Pierre Arcand, to require Hydro-Québec it ceases to impose fees for the next steps to 2.9 million residential customers now having smart meters that automatically transmit their consumption data. 
"Hydro-Québec demanded the installation of smart meters for all Quebeckers. However, these counters have precisely as the main advantage of not requiring any manual succession. Yet the Crown Corporation continues to impose, with all its clients, fees for succession; In just one year, this measure has resulted in $ 67 million. The government must put an end to this unfair surfacturation and require Hydro-Québec that it reimburses Quebeckers the 67 million they paid too much, "said Bernard Drainville. 
"There is even worse: customers who have chosen the withdrawal option - those who said no to the new counters - must pay to Hydro-Québec's additional fees of $ 5 per month to ensure manual succession. However, these customers are already paying for this service! Indeed, everyone has to pay $ 0.40 a day for the subscription fee, regardless of consumption. These fixed costs include $ 0.06 for the purpose of its meter. It is clearly the double billing, "added the spokesman. 
"In addition, we have never seen so many Quebeckers have difficulty paying their Hydro-Québec bill. This year, 300,000 customers must conclude a payment agreement, a sad record. The first thing to do is stop making them pay in duplicate. This surfacturation must stop, "concluded the member for Marie-Victorin.
