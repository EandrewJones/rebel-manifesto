Quebec- The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in education, Alexandre Cloutier, as well as the spokesman responsible for the French Language Charter, Maka Kotto, ask the government to reverse and cancel the cuts in Francization to prevent immigrant children from being penalized in their learning French. 
Indeed, it is learned this morning that the budgetary rules of the school boards are about to be approved by the Treasury Board, which will formalize the maintenance of francization cuts for the next school year. 
"In some school boards, it is 40% of the francization budget that flies away because of the cuts. These sums were used to help newcomers to master French and, thus provide them with the basic tool allowing them to succeed in their integration into Quebec society. Once again, the government is blindly cut into an essential service for students, "said the member for Lac-Saint-Jean. 
"We have a prime minister who juggles with the idea of moving to 60,000 the number of immigrants welcomed in Quebec each year, while it is not even able to guarantee access to francization courses Allophone students in our schools right now. The government prefers to drascically cut the budgets of the francization courses. It's inconceivable, paradoxical, or even absurd! , "Added Maka Kotto. 
"While the number of allophone students is rising steadily in our schools, the government decides to cut into the first integration and success factor of these students: francization! This government is completely disconnected and continues its long series of cuts in direct students. He simply puts the future of these New Quebec, "concluded Alexander Cloutier.
