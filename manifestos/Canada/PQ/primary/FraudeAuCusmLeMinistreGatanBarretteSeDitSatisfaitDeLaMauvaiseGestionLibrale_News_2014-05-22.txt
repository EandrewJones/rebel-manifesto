"An investigator of the hammer squad has described to the Charbonneau Commission this week the MUHC scandal as the greatest corruption fraud in the history of Canada. The current Minister of Education, Yves Bolduc, said the project was flawless. The Minister of Health agrees with him, according to him from this morning at the National Assembly, "said Stéphane Bergeron. 
"Quebeckers already contribute significantly to their health system. The MUHC scandal cost tens of millions of dollars to citizens. The minister has not even been able to recognize that the lack of vigilance of the Liberal government has deprived money that could have been used to improve access to services and care, "says Diane Lamarre. 
The Minister Barrette added by indicating: "And, as far as what happened in the past, the past did well, I said earlier, and we will close it in the same spirit. » 
"Considering the disaster of the MUHC in terms of integrity and public finances, it is rather aberonant that the Minister considers that everything has been done in the rules of the art, suggesting that the same way to do will be applied to the to come up. It is both surprising and disturbing to hear Mr. Barrette's answers to our questions. We strongly hope that the government is more rigorous in the management of all projects, so that no other scandal of this magnitude does on the day under the Couillard government, have concluded members.
