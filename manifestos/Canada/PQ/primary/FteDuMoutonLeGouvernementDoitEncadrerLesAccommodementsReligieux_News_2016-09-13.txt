"Pierre Paradis has been claiming for two years that animal welfare is his priority. Yet, during the study of Bill 54, he repeatedly refused the amendments proposed by the Parti Québécois to avoid unnecessary suffering to an animal called to be shot down. The CAQ had been reassured by the Minister's comments, which said that our amendments were not needed. The exit of Sylvie d'Amours on this subject has surprised us a lot, this morning, "said André Villeneuve. 
"To this is added the information, conveyed since the beginning of the day, according to which schools would have been closed yesterday for religious reasons. This is the proof that in the absence of clear tags, the institutions, left to themselves, are forced to operate on a case-by-case basis, "said Agnès Maltese. 
"These two events demonstrate the disability of the Liberal government to respond firmly when it comes time to supervise religious accommodations. Its action is only guided by clientelism. We certainly believe that there must be a debate around reasonable accommodations. If we wish that this type of incident does not happen again, we must legislate and equip Quebec with clear tags, "concluded the member for Taschereau.
