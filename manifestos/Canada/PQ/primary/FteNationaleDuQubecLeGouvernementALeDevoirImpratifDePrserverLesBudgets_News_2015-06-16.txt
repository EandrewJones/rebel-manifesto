Weaken our national holiday, so it is certainly, to diminish our ability to show that we are collectively, and this aspect is fundamental when it comes to welcoming new Quebeckers, "said Sylvain Pagé. 
"The Government of Quebec must commit to maintaining the unique, civic and non-mercantile character of our national holiday. Pride is not reinstated. It is an individual and collective phenomenon maintained by the generations of Quebecers who have built our nation. Our government must ensure that budgets dedicated to Quebec National Day is its duty. I offer, moreover, all my collaboration so that we find, with all the partners, sustainable solution tracks that will fund the national holiday for the coming years, "added the member for Labelle.
