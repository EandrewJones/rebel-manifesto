Quebec-the member for Marie-Victorin and the official opposition to the energy, Bernard Drainville, is seriously referring to the attitude of the senior management of Hydro-Québec which has hidden an important leak from The Gentilly 2 plant last June, causing the closure of the plant for several days. 
"LL is about the health and safety of people. If the incident occurred last June was anodin as we are told, why hid it to the population? The explanations of the management of Hydro are insufficient, "said Bernard Drainville. 
The member for Marie-Victorin also wondered whether the Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, was aware of this incident. "Or she was aware and she preferred to get an accomplice of the senior management of Hydro-Québec and hide the information to Quebecers, or she was not what is not reassuring," -T he pursued. 
Mr. Drainville notes that it has been more than six months since the Crown corporation has sent a variety of documents on the future of the nuclear power plant, but Minister Normandeau secrets secrets. It should also be remembered that the Parti Québécois has repeatedly claimed a parliamentary committee on Gentilly 2 in order to read the studies and reports on the possible repair of the nuclear power plant. 
"In March, before colossal cost overruns and the actual use of the plant in Quebec's energy portfolio, Hydro-Québec did not exclude the total closure of the plant. We voted in favor of closing the plant; Quebec has considerable assets in renewable and green energies and does not need the nuclear sector. Those who accuse us of being not worried about job losses are in bad faith: Hydro-Québec is a sufficiently developed corporation to reintegrate these people into other divisions, after the closing work that will last several years ", Concluded the member for Marie-Victorin.
