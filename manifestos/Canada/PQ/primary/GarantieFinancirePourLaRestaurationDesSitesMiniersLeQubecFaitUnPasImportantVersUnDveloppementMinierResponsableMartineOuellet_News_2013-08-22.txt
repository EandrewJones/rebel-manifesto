Quebec- The Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for Nordic Development, Mrs. Martine Ouellet, is pleased to highlight the entry into force on August 22, 2013, of the Rules requiring mining companies the filing of a 100% financial guarantee of the Costs of restoration of mining sites that they exploit. 
"The entry into force of this regulation is an excellent news for all Quebeckers. From now on, taxpayers will no longer have to pay the invoice for the restoration of future mine sites that would be abandoned. It is an important step forward to ensure responsible mining development, "said Ouellet. 
The new regulation passes the financial guarantee that mining companies should be deposited by 70% to 100% of the estimated costs of restoration. In addition, this warranty now covers the entire mining site and not only the accumulation areas of mining residues, as was the case before. The deposit of the guarantee must be done over a period of two years following the beginning of the exploitation of a mine, in three installments, while, in the past, mining companies had up to 15 years to do so. Under Decree 838-2013, the Regulations have been published in the Gazette officielle du Qu√©bec on August 7th. It comes into force 15 days later, today on August 22, 2013. 
"Already mining companies have acted responsibly by voluntarily paying their financial guarantee at the very beginning of the operation. The draft regulation therefore aims to generalize and supervise this good practice for better protection of the environment, "concluded the minister.
