Quebec- The member for Terrebonne and spokesman for the family party in family, Mathieu Traversy, is ulcerated by the words of the Minister of the Family, Francine Charbonneau, who admitted not to worry about the fact that the parents of the Québec gradually turn your back at CPE, because for her, a child care or not, "it's the same thing". 
"The same thing, really? Does the minister know that 76% of the complaints received at the Department awarded a private day care center, and that this percentage is rising? Non-subsidized private daycares are only 42% of complaints in Quebec, while providing 19% of available places. I invite Francine Charbonneau to learn more; Several studies demonstrate that the quality of services is higher in CPEs, and that the educational program provides positively contributing to children's development. With regard to private daycare, especially those who are not governed, it is rather the opposite: no studies do their apology, "said the spokesman. 
The hon. Member recalls that non-subsidized private daycares were the scene of the vast majority of cases of abuse and negligence reported in the media lately. "Unfortunately, when it comes to non-subsidized custody environments, there is no guarantee of quality; These daycares are not subject to the same rules as subsidized child care services, including accountability to the Ministry of Family, "he added. 
"As of April 2014, the Liberals undertook to discredit and dismantle the CPE network, despite the fact that this model is one of the most beautiful Québec successes. It is quite incomprehensible; We want this network all over the world! I would like a lot that Minister Charbonne explain to me, as well as to Quebec's parents, why she and her government act so, "concluded Mathieu Traversy.
