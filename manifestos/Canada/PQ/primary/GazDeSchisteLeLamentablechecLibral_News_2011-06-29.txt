Quebec - Member for Vachon and official opposition spokesperson for the environment, sustainable development, parks and water, Martine Ouellet, and the member for the Assumption and Spokesperson in terms of mines Scott McKay, ask the Liberal government to demonstrate humility against the population by recognizing its failure in managing the shale gas file. "The withdrawal of one of the Gas of the Trained Committee to complete the strategic environmental assessment on this sector is irrefutable evidence that the whole process put in place by the Liberal government is gangrenary. You have to go back to zero! "Said Martine Ouellet. 
Moreover, the departure of the Junex representative of this committee clearly demonstrates that the very composition of this evaluation group is lacking. "There were two gas on this committee of experts. If Junex withdraws to give credibility to the current process, the other gas company, Talisman, should do the same thing. Since the announcement of a strategic environmental assessment last March, we ask that environmental groups and citizen committees are present. This is an opportunity to give them the place they deserve, "said Scott McKay. 
The Liberal government goes from false steps in shale gas file. "The comedy of errors has lasted enough! The concerns of the population are legitimate. Thousands of people have been mobilizing for months. The government must stop listening only to the gas companies and finally make the will of the population its line of conduct. A big bar stroke is needed, "continued the mine spokesperson. 
"The Parti Québécois offers concrete solutions to the government to redress the situation. A comprehensive moratorium should be decreed from the exploration and exploitation of shale gas and associate the office of public hearings on the environment in the strategic environmental assessment process to make it rigorous and transparent, "concluded. The member for Vachon.
