Quebec -The Parti Québécois welcomes the determination of several municipal citizens who went to Pennsylvania last week to better understand the effects of shale gas exploitation. 
"Their observations are worrying: contamination of water and wells, depreciation of the value of houses, harmfulness of silica, archaic exploitation. In short, as many reasons which are ample, that here in Quebec, the good decisions and, in this sense, the hydraulic fracturing must be prohibited, "said the hon. Member for Vachon and sentence of the official opposition. Mine and shale gas material, Martine Ouellet. 
The Parti Québécois considers that the current technology is not at the point. The citizens who traveled to Pennsylvania could learn that horizontal wells can now reach a length of 4 km, instead of 1 km announced here. Moreover, several groundwater wells have been contaminated during vertical drilling. The risk is great, even at the stage of exploration. 
"Technology is not at the point. The industry plays apprentices with wizards, does not control and experiences environmental and citizens' back experiments. The citizens of the St. Lawrence plain are not and do not want to become laboratory rats, "added the member. 
For more than a year, the Parti Québécois has been calling for a complete moratorium on shale gas exploration and exploitation. "With all we have learned for a year, we must also, as in France, forbid hydraulic fracturing. The Charest government must, by the adjournment of parliamentary work in December, present a bill to this effect, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
