Quebec- Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Yves-Fran√ßois Blanchet, announces that it mandates the office of public hearings on the environment (BAPE) so that it leads Public consultation on the shale gas sector. "I entrust this mandate to BAPE, as I have committed to do so and as asked the citizens of the St. Lawrence Lowlands, because we must have all the necessary knowledge in hand to make an informed and responsible decision in this file, "said the minister. 
This consultation will build on the studies commissioned as part of the science gas strategic assessment (EAS), which ended last December. Thus, the BAPE will have more than 70 studies, carried out by independent third parties and by university experts, to carry out its mandate. The summary report of these studies will be made public shortly by the EAS Committee and serve as a basis for consultation. 
"The challenges of exploring the exploration and exploitation of shale gas in the Shale of Utica of the St. Lawrence Lowlands have raised strong concerns in the population. The broad social consensus that has crystallized justifies that the vote in the National Assembly on the principle of Bill 37 has been unanimous. By choosing to entrust this mandate in BAPE, the government makes sure to adopt a clear, scientific and transparent approach that will enlighten its reflection on this energy sector, "said the minister. 
Remember which bill 37 is going to establish a moratorium on certain activities related to the research or exploitation of natural gas in the Schist of the St. Lawrence Lowlands. It was tabled in 2013 and the National Assembly adopted the principle. 
The mandate of the BAPE will begin on March 31, 2014. More details on this public consultation will be available on the BAPE website atwww.bape.gouv.qc.ca.
