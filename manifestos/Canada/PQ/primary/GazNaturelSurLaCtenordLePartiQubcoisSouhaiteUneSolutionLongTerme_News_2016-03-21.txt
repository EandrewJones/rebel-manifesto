Quebec- The Quebec Party spokesperson in Nordic development, Lorraine Richard, is disappointed with the announcement made this morning in Port Cartier by the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Pierre Arcand. If ArcelorMittal's natural gas conversion pilot project represents a first step, the member wishes firmer commitments from the government to serve the entire region. 
"I unfortunately can not rejoice at the announcement of this morning. Yes, with this pilot project, ArcelorMittal will produce less greenhouse gases, but the good news stops there. This project means an annual increase of more than a hundred trucks on Route 138, and I am sure that no North Coast does not want that, "launched the member for Duplessis. 
For many years, the elected representatives of the Côte-Nord have denounce the lamentable state of Route 138 and the lack of investment by the government to improve it. The addition of more than a hundred trucks per year will participate in the degradation of the roadway and the increase in heavy traffic, which has only increased since the launch of the Romaine project. 
"This solution can only be temporary. For years, the Côte-Nord has demanded a natural gas service. The industries present need to reduce their costs and their GHG emissions, but we want it mainly to attract companies that work in transformation, in order to develop our economy. Unfortunately, I do not see any firm commitment from this government in this sector, "concluded the hon. Member.
