Quebec- The member for Berthier and the official opposition on the agriculture, André Villeneuve, calls on the Quebec Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, and the federal parties to be clearly in the defense of Quebec farmers in the framework of the transpacific partnership negotiations. 
In an article published today in Leglobe and Mail, we learn that the abandonment of the supply management system has been envisaged by the Harper government for weeks. Indeed, farmers who would suffer the consequences of the transpacific partnership signature would receive a set of compensation, which has been evaluated last month in Ottawa. 
"When two ministers from the Harper Government, in this case Denis Lebel and Maxime Bernier, say they will defend the management of the offer in the framework of the negotiations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership but, in secret, they prepare it Abandonment, we can only conclude that they laugh in Face! "Denounced André Villeneuve. 
"For weeks, the Parti Québécois and the Bloc Québécois are echoed with farmers' concerns. Where is Minister Paradis? Prime Minister Couillard? Thomas Mulcair and Justin Trudeau? Here is a new evidence of the importance of Quebec's independence. It is necessary, more than ever, that we are present at international bargaining tables if we really want to defend the interests of Quebecers, "concluded the member for Berthier.
