Quebec, on April 19, 2017- reacting to the US President Donald Trump, who attacks the supply management in the dairy sector, the spokespersons of the Parti Québécois in the field of agriculture and Food, André Villeneuve, and Economy, Alain Therrien, ask the Premiers Trudeau and Couillard to show no weakness in their defense of Quebec dairy farmers. 
IN SHORT 
"Americans want to continue to exploit a flaw in Canadian customs control to delight market share to our producers. However, respecting the existing rules is not a change to our trade! Supply management has been in existence for longer than NAFTA, and this has not prevented its ratification or carried out to question the agreement in the past. There is no reason to make the slightest compromise about it, especially when we know that American milk is strongly subsidized. Justin Trudeau and Philippe Couillard must maintain 100% offer management, "said André Villeneuve. 
"Let us remember that about 83,000 jobs depend on the dairy sector in Quebec. Philippe Couillard can not remain passive. He must stand in front of Justin Trudeau and ensure that Quebec's interests are taken into consideration in trade negotiations. For its part, the federal government must, for once, be uncompromising and assert that we do not affect the supply management. The slightest concession would be unacceptable. Justin Trudeau must make a choice: go, yes or no, defend Quebec's milk producers? Asked Alain Therrien.
