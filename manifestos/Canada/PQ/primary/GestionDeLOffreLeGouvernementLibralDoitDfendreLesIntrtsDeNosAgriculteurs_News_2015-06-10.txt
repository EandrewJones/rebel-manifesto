"Nobody is fooled! Throughout Quebec, farmers are worried. They know that Canada does not play free game, that it is ready to sacrifice them, that its priorities are far from theirs. Everywhere, they mobilize to defend the management of the offer, which allows hundreds of Quebec SMEs to prosper and enrich our regions, "said André Villeneuve. 
For its part, Stéphane Bergeron added that in this file, the duty of the Government of Quebec is not only to support the farmers here and to defend their interests, but also to make sure that Ottawa is equally engaged. firmly in favor of maintaining supply management. "It's a priority for Quebec, and it is the duty of the Quebec government to ensure that it is also a priority for the federal government. We need guarantees on his part. In the absence of such guarantees, the Government of Quebec will have to undertake not to ratify the transpacific partnership, "he supported. 
"The Minister of Agriculture can say that he weakens alliances with the Canadian provinces, it is not in Toronto that he has to put pressure, it's in Ottawa! He must stop behaving asked and, once and for all, to enforce Farmers in Quebec, "said the member for Berthier. 
"A Quebec Province is a Quebec submitted to the federal government. An independent Quebec would have its own voice to negotiate treaties, especially free trade, "concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
