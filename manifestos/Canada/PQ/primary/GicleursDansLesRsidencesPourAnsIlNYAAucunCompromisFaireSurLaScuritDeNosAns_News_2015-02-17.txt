Quebec- The hon. Member for Rimouski and the official opposition spokeswoman for seniors, Harold Lebel, as well as the hon. Member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesperson in housing, Carole Poirier, have shared their concerns In connection with the announcement of the government regarding the installation of sprinklers in seniors residences. 
"The tragedy of the Havre Residence, in Isle-Green, remains in our brief when we talk about fire protection or safety in seniors residences. There is no compromise to make the safety of the elders of Quebec. We welcome the minister's announcement about sprinklers, but there are still several questions he has not responded, "said Harold Lebel. 
"Who will pay for the installation of these sprinklers and what form will this funding take? Will the dwellings benefit from financial assistance? All these questions are complex, and we have no answer. We also have questions about the five-year period, which seems to us long, but we will leave the chance at the runner, "continued Carole Poirier. 
The member for Rimouski said, moreover, that various measures taken by the government may compromise actions for the safety of seniors. "The Treasury Board keeps state employees in their offices by imposing several tags on their displacements. Can inspections be compromised? In addition, health agencies were entrusted with the inspection and regulation of residences. With the brewing of structures of the Minister Barrette, who will now be responsible for it? ", he added. 
Finally, Harold Lebel wonders where the minister responsible for seniors, Francine Charbonneau, today; He would have liked it to present his overall plan for the supervision and security of seniors.
