Quebec, on November 22, 2017 -The official opposition spokesman for the Treasury Board, Nicole Léger, is pleased that the Liberal government accepts its proposal to appoint the CEO of the Autorité des Procurement Public (GPA) with the Approval of two-thirds of deputies elected to the National Assembly. As for the public safety spokesperson, Pascal Bérubé, he wants the Minister of Public Security, Martin Coiteux, to take an example on his colleague Robert Poëti and that he accepts that the boss of the permanent unit anti-corruption (UPAC ), too, appointed by the elected officials. 
IN SHORT 
"From the beginning of the study of Bill 108, law promoting the supervision of the contracts of public bodies and establishing the authority of the public procurement, I insisted on the Minister so that the CEO is appointed by a vote Two-thirds of the National Assembly, and I filed amendments to that effect. I am pleased that Minister Robert Poëti has told our arguments so that the CEO of the GPA, which will be the large supervisor of public contracts, finally appointed by all elected officials, "said Nicole Léger. 
However, the Liberal government still refuses that the Commissioner to the fight against corruption, who runs the UPAC, be appointed by the National Assembly. "For several years, the Québécois party has requested that the boss of the UPAC be appointed by a vote of at least two-thirds of the deputies, in order to prevent the one who investigates the party in power is appointed by the same party . I apply to the Coiteux Minister: Take an example on your colleague, show opening and accept our proposal: the boss of UPAC must be chosen by at least two-thirds of the deputies, "added Pascal Bérubé.
