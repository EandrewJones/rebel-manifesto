Quebec, on May 24, 2017- The Quebec Party spokesperson for the work of work, Marc Bourcier, asks the Liberal government to get out of its torpor and to mandate a special mediator to conduct negotiations in the construction sector. 
IN SHORT 
"A negotiated solution is always preferable; What the Liberal government has to do today is to demonstrate leadership and appoint a special mediator to accelerate the conclusion of an agreement between the parties, so that the strike in the construction sector ends the faster possible. So far, Dominique Vien has remained invisible, as she knows for months what is getting ready. She knew the consequences of such a strike for the whole population, industry players and their families. Where was Dominique Vien, these last six months? What did she do? "Said Marc Bourcier. 
"Today, the Minister of Labor has announced that it will meet with all parties. Why did not she do it before, instead of brandishing the threat of a special law at midnight less one? As in several files, it is now the Prime Minister to take things in hand and to overcome the absence of one of his ministers. We hope it will be possible to arrive at a negotiated agreement, not a taxed regulation, "added Mr. Bourcier. 
"Industry leaders are responsible for finding compromises to reach an agreement as soon as possible. They must avoid putting their fate in the hands of this government, "concluded the member.
