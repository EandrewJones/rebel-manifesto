Quebec, on January 26, 2017- Nicole Léger, spokesman for the Treasury Board, regrets that the governmental position has hardly changed since the arrival of Pierre Moreau, forcing the strikers to persist. 
"Since the beginning of the conflict, the Parti Québécois claims that the negotiations are carried out in good faith, so that a negotiated solution is found as soon as possible. However, the lawyers and notaries of the State have just refused the offer of Pierre Moreau. We expected him to do all that is in his power to untie the impasse, but that's not what happened, "said Nicole Léger. 
The Parti Québécois asks Pierre Moreau to make public the internal study of the Treasury Board Secretariat serving as a basis for the distinction it makes between the status of state lawyers and that of prosecutors associated with the Director of Criminal Prosecutions and criminal (PPCP). "The main obstacle to the settlement of the conflict is the question of whether state lawyers have the same particular status as PPCP prosecutors. However, Pierre Moreau refuses to reveal the internal study that helps him to support the argument that the lawyers of the state do not exercise the same function as the prosecutors of the PCPP. It is a lack of transparency incompatible with healthy negotiations, "added the spokesman. 
"The mandate given by Prime Minister in Pierre Moreau is clear: resolving the longest conflict in the history of the Quebec public service. It must therefore activate! The lawyers of the state, for 14 weeks, are in front of a deaf government to their demands. If this conflict has had and continues to have heavy legal, financial, legislative and administrative impacts, it is because this government shows contempt and closure, "said the member.
