Quebec, on December 21, 2016 - The Quebec Party Word for Treasury Board, Nicole Léger, challenges the Liberal government to intensify negotiations to find a solution to the conflict that opposes it to the lawyers of the State. "The Liberals behave in real grumpy who want to spoil Christmas. They turn a deaf ear to the demands of hundreds of lawyers and notaries of the Quebec state that have been on strike since October 24th. It is therefore hundreds of mothers and fathers who will have to live in uncertainty, not knowing if they will return to work after the holidays. The government should be ashamed, "she denounced. 
Not only should this conflict be settled, for the good of all, but, in this case, the liberal nonchalance has in addition to heavy impact on the conduct of state affairs. Indeed, combined with the crisis of justice time, the strike of state lawyers creates the conditions for a perfect storm that could lead to the forced judgment of hundreds of appeal now out of time. "As long as the government has not resolved this working conflict, citizens will be deprived of an indispensable expertise in the proper functioning of the public administration and the application of the laws. The Liberals, by their laxism, thus put oil on the fire. And everyone is losing! The lean legislative assessment of the last parliamentary session of the Liberal government can testify, besides ... He holds on a post-it! ", Illustrated the spokesman. 
In order to put all the chances on the side of a conflict settlement before the holidays, Nicole Léger makes a simple proposal to the government: negotiating. "There are only a few hours left before the celebration of holidays. Therefore, if he hopes to resolve this conflict quickly and allow lawyers to return to work after Christmas, the government has only one option: sit at the table and negotiate in good faith. Is it so complicated, is? This too much ask? "She concluded.
