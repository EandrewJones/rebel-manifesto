Quebec- The member for Bonaventure and spokesman for the Quebecois on forests, wildlife and parks, Sylvain Roy, deplores the confusion that surrounds the establishment of an action plan for the development of the Forest caribou habitat. The plan, divided into two phases, first presents forest caribou protection measures, and then assess the consequences for forest communities. 
"The government works inconsistently. It should first assess the socio-economic consequences of a protective plan on logging and the supply of factories, and then put in place measures with full knowledge of the facts. It is clear that by working upside down, the government creates uncertainty in the forest communities of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean and Nord-du-Qu√©bec, "said Sylvain Roy. 
The hon. Member for Bonaventure finds completely unacceptable that the government improvised a strategy without taking into account forest workers. According to him, he is abnormal that the government has still not published a study on the impact of caribou protection on forest jobs, while in place since April 2014. 
"The Prime Minister, who is also a member of the region affected by the action plan, promised, at the last election campaign, that no forestry job would be sacrificed for the protection of caribou. However, two years after his election, his government presents a confusing plan that does not guarantee forest workers that they will be able to maintain their jobs. He must redo his homework and present us a credible strategy! "Sylvain Roy concluded.
