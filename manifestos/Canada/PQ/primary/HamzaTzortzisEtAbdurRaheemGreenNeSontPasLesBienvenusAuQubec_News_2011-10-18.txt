Montreal -The MP D'Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition on secularism, Carole Poirier, strongly denounces the arrival of two controversial speakers in Montreal and urges the government to act to prevent the holding of their conference in The city. 
"Hamza Tzortzis and Abdur Raheem Green, who must participate this week at a conference organized in Montreal by the Islamic Education and Research Academy, are preachers notoriously recognized for their deeply antif√©minist, homophobic and freedom of expression", has Declared Carole Poirier. 
"The Quebec Council of Gais and Lesbians as well as the Federation of Women in Quebec have already denounced the arrival of these characters. Messrs Tzortzis and Green are based on Sharia to put forward their retrograde and undemocratic theories as the predominance of man on the woman and the legitimization of the use of violence by a husband to prevent or correct his wife if she does not does not respect his authority; The criminalization of homosexuality under penalty of death and flogging as well as the rejection of the notion of freedom of expression, "said the hon. Member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. 
"These people are clearly not welcome in a democratic society like Quebec! Germany has already forbiddown them to stay on its territory and the United States, by the voice of Barack Obama, have meant to this kind of individuals that they were not welcome in the United States soil. The government must act quickly to expel Quebec mm. Tzortzis and Green, "concluded Carole Poirier.
