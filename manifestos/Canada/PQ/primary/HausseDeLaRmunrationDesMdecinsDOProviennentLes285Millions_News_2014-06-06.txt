"The President of the Federation of Medical Specialists of Quebec said he had never seen this figure. What about the transparency promised by the government? The President of the Treasury Board refused three times to answer my question.

The Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, and the Minister of Health and Social Services, Gaétan Barrette, had given last Friday to reach an agreement, even going to evoke a special law.
