Quebec- The Leader of the Official Opposition and MP of Charlevoix, Pauline Marois, urges the Prime Minister to act in responsible government and to open a dialogue with students. "The bounded attitude of the Liberal government in front of the students has lasted enough. The real leadership is to get results. The prime minister's attitude has produced the opposite effect. There are now more than 200,000 Quebec students who are on strike. The activities of our CEGEPs and our universities are paralyzed. The demonstrations are multiplying, the conflict is surviving, "she said. 
The 75% increase in tuition fees hit the middle class families that will have to pay up to $ 3,800 a year per child at the university, in addition to related costs and livelihoods. For a family with two, three or four children, accessibility to higher education may be compromised. 
"You should know that the vast majority of young people in middle-class families is not entitled to scholarships. It is legitimate for a government to make the decision to increase tariffs, but there are limits, 75%, it just does not make sense. Student leaders have made his hand to the government several times. I therefore invite the Prime Minister to show a real leadership, to take responsibility and open the dialogue with students, "added Pauline Marois. 
"True leadership is not exercised by being rigid and deaf like Jean Charest, but by accepting a dialogue with students to find solutions and get results," she said. 
"If the Liberals persist at the end and impose this increase, a government of the Parti Québécois will annul. If Quebeckers trust us to train the next government, we will keep a summit on higher education. We will then meet all the actors and we will establish an acceptable method of financing for all parties, "concluded the official opposition leader.
