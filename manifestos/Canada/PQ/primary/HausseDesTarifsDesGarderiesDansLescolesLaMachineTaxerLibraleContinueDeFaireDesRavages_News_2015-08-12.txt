Quebec- The member of Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for primary and secondary education, Nicole Léger, asks the Minister of Education, Higher Education and Research, François Blais, reverse by canceling the increase in child care rates in schools. 
"The budgetary rules decreed by the Liberal government confirm: it has been cut directly into grants dedicated to child care services. Minister François Blais is therefore responsible for this unacceptable rise in rates that strikes the families of the Quebec middle class. It's a hard hit for them today and a few days from the start of the school year. No question, this time, that the minister scrolls with the fault on schools! Nicole Léger said. 
"We now realize that the Minister of Education has made fun of Quebeckers when he said, in the spring, that the rise in child care rates would be minor and that she would not affect all schools. It was porridge for cats! The Minister of Education must reverse and respect the promise of his Prime Minister who claimed last December that he would limit increases in inflation. In addition, the government has a good time that it will give a tax credit to families, this will certainly not cover the entire increase because, if not, why would it have imposed one? Families will still have to pay money during the school year until the production of their tax report. And what will the government do for less fortunate families who do not pay taxes? , Asked the member of the Quebecois Party. 
Quebeckers: the turkeys of liberal stuffing 
"We increase the number of children by class, we cut off the services to those who are experiencing learning difficulties, we decrease the resources for young people with disabilities and, today, it is learned that the invoice for child care in The schools will double. After that, one wonders why cynicism towards the policy is gaining ground. This Liberal government laughs from Quebeckers! ", Has concluded Nicole Léger.
