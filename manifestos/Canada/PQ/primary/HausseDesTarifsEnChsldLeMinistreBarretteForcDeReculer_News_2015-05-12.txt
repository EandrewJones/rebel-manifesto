Quebec- The member for Richelieu and the official opposition spokeswoman for seniors, Sylvain Rochon, and the member for Taillon and spokesperson for health and accessibility to care, Diane Lamarre, find that Minister Ga√©tan Barrette was forced to retreat on the increase in rates, superior to inflation, which he wanted to impose residents in CHSLD, many of whom are seniors. They also undertake to remain vigilant about the modulation announced by the Minister. 
"The Minister Barrette finally heard, after all the questions we asked him about the study of appropriations and in question. Remember that the Prime Minister himself promised, in the election campaign last year that the rates would not increase beyond inflation, "said Sylvain Rochon. 
The member adds that people hosted in CHSLD need quality care; However, it seems that at present, this care is given very unevenly from one institution to another. "Black baths, showers every two years, 3752 Quebeckers on the waiting list, inadequate intervention plans ... The list is long! Can we now focus on patient care instead of concocting gains rates? He asked. 
Diane Lamarre recalls for his part that it is the official opposition issues to the Minister of Health that resulted in the increase in tariffs for seniors. "The increase in CHSLD tariffs beyond inflation was concealed among the 1200 pages of documents sent to parliamentarians. The minister first described it as a shell, which, obviously, was not the case. Does he always want to pick up $ 10.4 million by changing how to calculate the contribution of residents? We will remain vigilant for the rest of the things and today we ask the minister to devote his energies to improve the care and services offered to our seniors and heavily disabled people who reside in CHSLD, "she concluded .
