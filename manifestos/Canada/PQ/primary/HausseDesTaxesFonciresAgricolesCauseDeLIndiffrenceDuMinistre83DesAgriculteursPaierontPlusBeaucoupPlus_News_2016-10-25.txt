Quebec- The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, denounces once again the attitude of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Paradis, who refuses to listen to agricultural producers who will undergo a draconian increase in land taxes, as a result of the changes made by the government to the agricultural land tax credit program. "By acting in this way, the minister places thousands of producers in an untenable financial position, and he was safe," he said. 
In a press point at the National Assembly, André Villeneuve, alongside agricultural producers in several regions of Quebec, summoned the minister to intervene. It was also accompanied by the Vice-President of the Union of Agricultural Producers (UPA), Pierre Lemieux, the President of the UPA-Montérégie, Christian St-Jacques, the Vice-President of the UPA-Montérégie, Jeremiah Letllier, and a representative of the Quebec Federation of Municipalities, Guy St-Pierre. 
André Villeneuve also arrested the Minister Paradise on this subject during the question period at the National Assembly; The latter was insensitive to the situation experienced by producers. "For months, Pierre Paradis hid the truth to farmers. When we finally read the department's data, it was discovered that 83% of farmers would undergo a tax increase. How can Pierre Paradis sweep from the back of the hand the concerns of those who will have to pay the rise? The minister has been completely indifferent to Jérémie Letellier, producer in Napierville, who will have to pay $ 3,800 more because of the announced changes, such as Yvon Boucher, producer of Saint-Césaire, who pay $ 4000 In addition to taxes, "he illustrated. 
"The Liberal government has to postpone the application of the changes, the time to find a way to avoid farmers to be penalized by an invoice of thousands of additional dollars, coming directly from their pockets," concluded the spokesperson.
