Quebec- The member of Pointe-Aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for primary and secondary education and school perseverance, Nicole Léger, denounces unintended the will of the Liberal government to no longer distinguish between Children in difficulty and others to calculate the master-student ratio. On this subject, it must absolutely reverse. She also asks the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport to publicly explain to teachers what her government wants to do, instead of remaining mute. 
"The Liberal government has totally lost contact with reality. Does it really believe that this measure will not affect the quality of education in Quebec's primary and secondary schools? Does it believe that the increase in the master-student ratio in disadvantaged circles will have no effect on academic success? On which planet lives the Liberal government? "," Said Nicole Léger. 
"It's a slap for parents of children in difficulty. The Quebec government drops them, they are fighting day after day so that their children will fit as much as possible to the school network. The teachers will now have less time to consecrate them, "added the spokesman. 
Nicole Léger believes that in the end, all the children of Quebec will undergo the backlash of this irreflected measure. "It is obvious that this decision does not take into account the quality of teaching and the well-being of young people. It has been taken for financial reasons, point to the line, "she concluded.
