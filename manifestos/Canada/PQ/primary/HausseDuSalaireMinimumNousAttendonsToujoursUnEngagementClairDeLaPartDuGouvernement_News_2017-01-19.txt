Quebec, January 19, 2017- The spokesperson for the Quebecois Labor Party, Marc Bourcier, reacted to the announcement of Minister Dominique Vien, according to which the minimum wage will soon be enhanced 50 cents to reach 11.25 $ per hour. Although it welcomes this increase, Marc Bourcier notes with disappointment that the government still refuses to engage with workers to take the means to bring the minimum wage to $ 15. 
"We are pleased to see that the People's Movement, supported by the Parti Québécois, forced the Liberals to move and announce higher than last year. Unfortunately, the announced increase is not accompanied by a clear plan to bring the $ 15 minimum wage by 2022, "said the spokesperson. 
"Note that any accelerated increase in the minimum wage must be accompanied by aid measures for our SMEs, which are currently being taken by the throat by the decisions of the Liberal government and the absence of an ambitious economic plan," added the Member of Saint-Jérôme. 
"On its own, the expected increase in the cost of feeding is $ 400 per family in 2017. Add to this the rise of several tariffs and the price of many other goods and services to which Quebeckers are confronted. To help families, the Parti Québécois proposed a $ 200 bonus from the Solidarity Tax Credit, which could be taken from the budget surpluses that the government has realized - in large part on the back of income people modest, by the way. This measure would help 2.7 million households, more than 200,000 minimum wage workers, "concluded Marc Bourcier.
