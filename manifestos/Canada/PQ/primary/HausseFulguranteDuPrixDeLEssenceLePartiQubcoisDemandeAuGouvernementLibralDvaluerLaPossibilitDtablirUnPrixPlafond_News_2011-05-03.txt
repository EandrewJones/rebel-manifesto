Québec - "The Figruante increase in the price of gasoline in recent weeks has a major impact in the budget of Quebec families. Beyond words, it takes action. The Liberal government of Jean Charest must explore all the means to limit the impact of this rise now ". This is asked by the National Assembly the hon. Member for the Official Opposition for the Protection of Consumers, François Rebello. 
Mr. Rebello emphasized that it will cost $ 1,000 more this year for each Quebec family at a price of $ 1.42 / liter. Now, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, the price of the liter is 10 hundred and 12 cents less. This state of affairs is explained in particular because these governments have set a maximum price. 
Despite the opening manifested by Minister Nathalie Normandeau, the member Rebello asks the government to go into action mode. "Minister Normandeau is in a hurry to act when it comes to shale gas, but press too slowly for motorists who are caught in the throat. We at the Parti Québécois, we are ready to sit with the government to study the proposal made by the Union of Consumers and the Quebec Association of Independents of Oil for the benefit of motorists, "continued Mr. Rebello. 
"By the case that Quebec is released from its oil reliance and that the electrification of transport is forcefully deployed throughout the territory, the Government has the obligation to take every means so that Quebec families will be No victims of a price of the liter of gasoline higher here than elsewhere, "he concluded.
