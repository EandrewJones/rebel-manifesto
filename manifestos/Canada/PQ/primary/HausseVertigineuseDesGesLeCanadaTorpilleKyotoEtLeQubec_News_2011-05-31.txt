Quebec - "The 5% increase in greenhouse gases in two years is very worrying and worrying. The consequences will be important. However, as Quebec be a member of a country that is the main grave of the Kyoto Protocol, it will not be able to distinguish itself, even if it has the best plan in the world. Ottawa Mines Quebec's efforts with the accomplice silence of Mr. Charest's Liberal government. " 
This is what the hon. Member for Vachon and spokesman of the official opposition in terms of sustainable development, environment, parks and water, Martine Ouellet, learning about the latest public data on The emission of greenhouse gases. 
For the Parti Québécois, the need for Quebec to have its voice in international forums is undeniable. "It is urgent that Quebec become a country. Currently, the position of Quebec is diluted in the Canadian position, a position that encourages oil sands and which undermines Quebec 's efforts, "added Ouellet. 
For her, Quebec is well positioned to demonstrate the viability of an economy based on green energies. "We have talent and knowledge in Quebec to make such a turn. What we miss is the political will. By abandoning the energy efficiency agency, with a clamping plane for the electrification of transport, and by promoting the blind shale gas without knowing the impacts, the Charest government can not achieve this Quebec ambition, "concluded The member for Vachon.
