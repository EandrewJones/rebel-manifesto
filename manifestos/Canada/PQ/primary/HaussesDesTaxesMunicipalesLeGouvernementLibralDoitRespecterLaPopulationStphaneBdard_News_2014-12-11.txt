Quebec- The member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, as well as the member for Gaspé and Municipal Affairs Spokesperson, Gaétan Lelièvre, ask the Prime Minister to demonstrate respect and honesty to taxpayers; To do this, he has the duty to meet the mayors, in order to give them clear guidance, instead of sending them an ultimatum and to make them threats. 
"It is clear that we are all part of the" morons "who sincerely thought that the new tax pact would result in widespread tax increases for all taxpayers in Quebec. And that was the case. What is a shame is that Minister Moreau thought that no one was going to realize it. And there, what I understand is that it now wants tax increases to be maintained, but that the name of the Liberal Party is not associated. It's still enough amazing. It's meany. It lacks honesty, it lacks respect. What I'm asking the Prime Minister is to act quickly, meet mayors. Because the government and its minister have lost all credibility, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
"If the government did not want citizens to raise their taxes, it should have made another choice than to increase the tax burden of families of $ 500 million. In addition, he refiled an invoice to taxpayers, letting them believe, falsely, that they would not do the expense. Faithful to the good old liberal recipe, the government of Philippe Couillard centralizes, cuts the resources in the region and refuses to the municipalities the increases in taxes. He must now assume his actions and explain them to the population, "concluded Gaétan Lelièvre.
