Quebec - the member for Berthier and the official opposition to the regional development and occupation of the territory, André Villeneuve, requires the government that it ceases to turn a deaf ear to the citizens who face Dragon raises of land taxes. 
"It's been eight years since Quebec citizens undergo constant increases in land taxes. In 2008, the Parti Québécois filed a bill to address this problem. Unfortunately, the government has never called it. Then, in 2010, we made a motion to the National Assembly ordering the government to introduce a bill and consult the people affected by this problem. The government has filed a bill last March, but since, nothing. This government does not even have the trouble to call its own bill! Yet the victims of land tax increases have things to say and need solutions to be brought, "said André Villeneuve. 
The Parti Québécois requires that the Minister of Municipal Affairs Laurent Lessard, hold and hear citizens in the context of public consultations on land tax increases. "The minister answers that he gives us his collaboration so that we can find together a better solution. It would be time for speaking to acts, that he ceases to flee his responsibilities and hear the citizens and all the actors concerned, "concluded the member.
