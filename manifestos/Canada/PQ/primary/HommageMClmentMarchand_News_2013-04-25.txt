Quebec- The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, moved from the death of the writer, a journalist and publisher Clément Marchand. 
Recipient of many awards, including twice the Athanase-David Prize, the highest distinction of the Quebec government in literature, Clément Marchand has also been a culture smaller who leaves an ineffacious brand in Mauricie and throughout Quebec. As a publisher, he published several of the great Poets and novelists Quebec and published the newspaper the public good, drawing up a portrait of the political, economic and social life of Mauricie. 
"There is an African universal proverb that says in substance: when an old man goes out, it's a burning library," said Minister Kotto. "This metaphor applies in every respect to Clement Marchand who has devoted his life to the vitality and influence of Quebec literature," added the minister by presenting his condolences to the relatives of the late disappeared.
