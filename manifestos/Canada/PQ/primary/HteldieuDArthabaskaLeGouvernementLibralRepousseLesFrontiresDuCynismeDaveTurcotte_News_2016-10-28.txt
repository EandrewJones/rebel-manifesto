"By promising today today the renovation of the Hôtel-Dieu d'Arthabaska, the Liberal Party pushes the borders of cynicism. Let us remember that the government promised the renovation of this hospital in 2009, in 2012 and 2014. Now that there will be a partial election in the riding of Arthabaska, the Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette, makes a detour By Victoriaville to announce that the project is now "under study", but not to mention schedule. It's the Marmot Day! Duplessis promised roads, the Minister Barrette promises hospitals, "said Dave Turcotte. 
"Since his election, the Liberal government cut $ 50 million in the health budget of the Mauricie and Central Quebec regions, which forced the authorities to make heartbreaking choices, such as cutting nine nursing positions. Auxiliaries in CHSLD, people who worked with vulnerable people. Unlike the waves promises about the Hôtel-Dieu, these cups are true, they hurt, "on his side exposed Diane Lamarre. 
This Friday, Dave Turcotte challenged the Minister responsible for the Center-du-Québec region, Laurent Lessard, on the themel'abandon of the Center-du-Québec region by the Liberal government. "It's a region that has been completely forgotten by the Liberal government. Health cuts, education and economic development have accumulated for two years. Laurent Lessard has once again demonstrated this morning that he has no vision for the future of the Center-du-Québec. It is not even able to tell us what sums will be reserved for the region in the surplus that its government has accumulated with cuts and increases in tariffs, "he concluded.
