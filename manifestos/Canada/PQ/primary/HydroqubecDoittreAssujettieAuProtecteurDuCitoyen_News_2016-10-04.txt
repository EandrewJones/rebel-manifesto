Quebec, on October 4, 2016 -The member for Sanguinet and spokesperson for the Economy, Energy and Natural Resources, Alain Therrien, asks the Liberal government to subjugate Hydro-Québec to the mandate of the Protector. citizen. 
"Now two years ago that the Protector of the Citizen, Raymonde Saint-Germain, asks the Government to deal with the complaints of citizens who are dissatisfied with the responses obtained from the Hydro-Québec Customer Service. Once again, last week, the Protector came back to the charge in its annual report: more than 400 people contacted its office in 2015-16 to request its help in connection with Hydro Québec. Ms. Saint-Germain had to inform these citizens that, unfortunately, the state society remains untouchable. It's inadmissible, "says Alain Therrien. 
"Recall that during the most recent study of budget appropriations, the Minister of Democratic Institutions said that she was studying the idea of securing Hydro Québec to the citizen's protector. She even promised to involve all members to determine the rest of things. Where is his reflection? Has it been blocked by the Prime Minister's office? In addition questioned the hon. Member for Sanguinet.
