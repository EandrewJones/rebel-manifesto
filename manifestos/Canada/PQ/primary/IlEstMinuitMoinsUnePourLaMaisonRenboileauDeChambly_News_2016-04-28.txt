Quebec- The member for Joliette and spokesman for the Crop and Communications Party, Véronique Hivon, arrested the Minister of Culture and Communications, Hélène David, to act to save the house René-Boileau From Chambly, whose construction would go back to the beginning of the nineteenth century. 
"Does our history and brands in our daily lives are important in Quebec? With the file of the house René-Boileau, the Minister of Culture has a golden opportunity to answer this question and send a clear message. It should be remembered that last week indicated that the demolition of the ancestral home was suspended until April 29th. This is the day after tomorrow. So it's midnight less one! Insisted the member for Joliette. 
Faced with the minister's evasive responses, Véronique Hivon reaffirmed the historical and architectural interest of the René-Boileau House, and claimed that there is a notice of classification. "The minister continues to list all that is already classified. Is she telling us that it's too much? Is she telling us that there should be a quota? On the contrary, the house René-Boileau is part of a heritage assembly and a tourist circuit. I ask the minister to take up his responsibilities and make a notice of classification at the location of the René-Boileau House, "she continued. 
Citizens and representatives of heritage defense organizations have launched a cry of the heart for the preservation of this important part of the regional and national heritage, and recalled its importance in the landscape of their environment. "To hear the minister, it looks like preserving heritage is a problem. But it's not a problem, it's an opportunity to seize. Our heritage is a collective wealth. All, together, it takes a priority, "concluded the member for Joliette.
