Québec- The hon. Member for René-Lévesque and Chief Executive Officer whip, Marjolan Dufour, as well as the hon. Member for Bonaventure and Forest Spokesperson, Sylvain Roy, ask the Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Wildlife. Parks, Laurent Lessard, take concrete steps to maintain the jobs of the Forest Products Factory resolved in Baie-Comeau. 
Yesterday, one of the three machines in the plant has ceased operations. A second could do the same December 12th. "It's midnight less one for the North Shore workers. The machines close and the minister still did not act concretely. People in the area came out in the streets by hundred to denounce the situation. The Baie-Comeau plant is essential to maintain the jobs related to the forest on the North Shore. It's the whole forest sector in the region that is at stake, "said Marjolain Dufour. 
The field of forest has been hit hard in recent months; Several factories have indeed interrupted their production in different regions, including Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Estrie and Mauricie. Remember that the liberal assessment is disastrous for the forestry sector: between 2003 and 2012, 20,000 direct job losses and 300 factory closures were counted. 
"The case of Baie-Comeau is not unique. The forest environment needs durable solutions. He has lost 82,000 full-time jobs since April, in all regions and all sectors, including the forest. Why does the Minister of Forests wait for factories to be at risk of closure before acting? ", Questioned Sylvain Roy.
