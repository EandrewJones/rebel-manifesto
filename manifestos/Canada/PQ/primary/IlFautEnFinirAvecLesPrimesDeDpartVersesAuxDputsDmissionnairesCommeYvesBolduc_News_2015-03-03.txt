Quebec- The member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for ethics and integrity, Stéphane Bergeron, asks the Government to act quickly to prohibit the granting of bonuses to resigning members as Yves Bolduc . 
"The Couillard Prime Minister should have requested categorically that his resigning Minister Yves Bolduc, renounces his departure bonus of more than $ 150,000. This is the third time in two years that a Liberal Member leaves during the mandate by placing his transition allowance, whereas Zakaib, of the Quebecois Party, and Christian Dubé, of the CAQ, renounced there. His sudden surprising conversion, knowing that his party had quickly opposed the abolition of the starting bonus cashed during the mandate. In my opinion, the magnitude of the controversy triggered by Yves Bolduc's gluttony is so much, so that it is necessary to ask whether his insistence to consider this question in a more global context does not constitute an attempt to Diversion, "said Stéphane Bergeron. 
"There is urgency to act. Currently, we are on the ground, especially with the people of Richelieu, and everywhere we feel the incomprehension and the frustration of the citizens in relation to the fact that a member, even after having solicited and obtained a democratic mandate, can pocket a premium If he leaves his duties to return to the practice of medicine. This is all the more unacceptable in their eyes that its general practitioner will be paid by taxpayers. Philippe Couillard did not have the courage to refuse this premium to his member. We ask him to act quickly to prevent this situation from happening again, "he added. 
"We also see that the CAQ is trying to make blur with the Happy Dubé report. However, while being errivated on the hypothetical implementation of this report, we forget that Yves Bolduc's bonus will cost more than $ 150,000 to Quebec taxpayers, while he will have a well-paid position in the sector. of health, "concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
