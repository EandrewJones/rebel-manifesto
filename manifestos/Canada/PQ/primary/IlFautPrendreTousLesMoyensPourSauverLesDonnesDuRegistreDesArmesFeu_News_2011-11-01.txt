Québec-The members of the National Assembly will have to decide tomorrow on an important motion concerning the Firearms Register and the will of Quebeckers to keep it in place. Thus, after a debate that will take place between 3 pm and 5 pm, the members will be called to vote on the following motion: 
By adopting this motion, the Firearms Controller of Quebec will have to take the necessary gestures to respect the National Assembly's decision and protect the data. In doing so, he fails the will of the Conservatives. 
"It's midnight less one. The Conservative government mocks the National Assembly and forces the stages of the study of its bill in the House of Commons for rapid adoption. It's a pure and simple affront. Before it is too late, the Quebec state must take all the means to save the firearms registry, "said the member for Verchères and the official opposition spokesperson. Public, Stéphane Bergeron. 
The member for Verchères notes in passing that the Conservatives have changed their speech. Previously, they agreed with the creation of a Quebec Firearms Registry. Today, they indicate their disagreement by claiming that it is a competence that is not about Quebec, even pushing arrogance until asserting that the unanimity of the National Assembly does not make the weight Faced with the demands of the firearms lobby. 
"Rather than lacking respect for Quebec elected officials, the Conservatives should come to the evidence: their project to abolish the gun register does not go to Quebec," concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
