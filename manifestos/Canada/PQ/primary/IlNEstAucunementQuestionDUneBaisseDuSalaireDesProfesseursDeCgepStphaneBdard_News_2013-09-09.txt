Québec- Minister responsible for the Government Administration and President of the Treasury Board, Stéphane Bédard, wishes to rectify erroneous information that the Treasury Board would have re-evaluated the salary of CEGEP teachers. 
"As the vast majority of public sector employees, Cégep's teachers have in pocket a valid collective agreement until March 31, 2015. There is no question that the government is diminishing their salary," said Minister Bédard. 
The parties held last June a first exchange about the value of the employment of college teachers. Several other exchanges are expected in the coming months. Also, so far, there has never been a wages or salary structure of college teachers as part of this work, or amending the classification plan. 
Remember that an agreement to carry out work on wage relativity has been concluded between the government and the major trade union organizations at the last round of negotiation. Work has been on this subject since the fall of 2012. They are mainly aimed at evaluating jobs that have not been covered by the work relating to pay equity, since they were without predominance, male or female. Thirty job categories will be subject to such an assessment, including college teachers.
