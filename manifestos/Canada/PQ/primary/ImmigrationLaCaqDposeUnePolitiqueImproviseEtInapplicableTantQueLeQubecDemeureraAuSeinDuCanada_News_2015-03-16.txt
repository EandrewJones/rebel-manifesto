Quebec- The member for Bourget and sentence of the official immigration opposition, Maka Kotto, judges the CAQ proposal for the integration of unrealistic newcomers improvised and inapplicable until Quebec remain within the Canada. 
"The CAQ has accustomed us to scaffolded bills without rigorous reflection. Once again, François Legault surfs on a fundamental issue without taking the total measure. Many of the ideas put forward by the CAQ can not currently apply in Quebec, since we do not control our entire immigration policy, "said Maka Kotto. 
Evaluation after three years 
"Suppose Quebec decides to expel a temporary resident who would not pass the test of the CAQ head; How would it take it, since it is Canada that gives the visa? In terms of immigration, Quebec is responsible for selecting candidates, and Canada's admission. We do not even know the date of arrival of these people, because it is not Quebec that oversees the entrances and exits of the territory at the borders; It's Canada, "continued the member. 
"If François Legault wishes to undertake negotiations with Ottawa for Québec to obtain its full rights in immigration, whether it is openly, instead of proposing unrealistic solutions," he added. 
CAQ vane 
"Not long ago, the CAQ stated that Quebec should welcome fewer immigrants; Now she says the opposite. During the election campaign, less than a year ago, his program contained nothing about this file; Now he suggests solutions that are simply inapplicable. The CAQ's proposal demonstrates that it takes the challenges of immigration lightly. The only way to do what the CAQ proposes is to realize the sovereignty of Quebec; We would thus be the only masters of our borders and our immigration policy, "concluded Maka Kotto.
