Quebec- In an interpellation, on May 22, the member for Richelieu and the official opposition spokeswoman for seniors, Sylvain Rochon, claimed that the Health and Social Services Commission (CSSS) resumes its Work in connection with the living conditions of the people hosted in CHSLD, as provided for the mandate adopted in 2013 under the government of the Quebecois party, but abandoned since. But our efforts have borne fruit: the Parti Québécois has convinced the CSSS to resume the mandate, and the decision has been announced earlier today. 
"Every week brings us a lot of disturbing stories involving seniors hosted in CHSLD. This mandate of initiative responds to the concern that I have expressed many times that a matter like that must be treated serenely and seriously, without interference or partisanship. The exchanges I had with the colleagues of the other courses, at the moment when we debated the relevance of resuming the mandate of initiative, allow me to hope for the eminently constructive work, carried out in the interest of the elders of Quebec , "Said Sylvain Rochon. 
The CSSS will therefore be called upon to continue the mandate of initiative: Living conditions of adults hosting in the accommodation and long-term care center. Since the public hearings are completed, CSSS members will visit a number of CHSLDs and will then look at the production of a report in which they will make recommendations to the government. 
"The members of the National Assembly have been able to agree on the conditions to be brought together to carry out the Special Commission on the question of dying in dignity; I trust that we can develop broad consensus on those allowing adults hosted in CHSLD to live in dignity, "concluded the spokesperson.
