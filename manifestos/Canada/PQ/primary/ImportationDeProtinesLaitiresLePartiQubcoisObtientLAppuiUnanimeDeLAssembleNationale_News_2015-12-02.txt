Québec- Federal regulations contain a breach for import, in Quebec, dairy protein. André Villeneuve, spokesman for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, is concerned about the effects of this breach on the price of milk on the farm. He said yesterday a motion to the National Assembly asking the federal government to decay it permanently. 
"The source of the problem is known. Federal rules allow the importation of dairy proteins. It is a blatant fault in regulation. Some producers lose up to $ 25,000 a year, which is, for the whole Quebec, a shortfall of the order of $ 200 million. The situation continues to deteriorate and Ottawa refuses to close the breach, "said the member for Berthier. 
After André Villeneuve arrested Minister Pierre Paradis during the question period, yesterday, the government agreed to support the motion of the Parti Québécois. "It is essential that the National Assembly send a unanimous message to the federal government: it must clutter the breach. Now the ball is in the Trudeau government camp. Minister Paradis, however, is responsible for ensuring that Ottawa rule the problem that affects our dairy producers, "said the member for Berthier. 
The motion, adopted unanimously, reads as follows: 
"That the National Assembly asks the federal government the strict application of the standards governing the import of dairy protein to avoid the weakening of supply management and the considerable reduction of the price of milk on the farm, this which leads to significant financial losses for Quebec producers and weakens their businesses; 
Whether it asks the federal government to close the breach that allows the import of dairy protein from the United States. »
