Started in April 2012, the construction of the new Desmarais bridge required investments of $ 15.9 million. 
"It replaces the former concrete bridge, built in 1939, which itself replaced a covered bridge that has been in office since 1919. This means the importance of this road link for the population of Amos. Aube of the 100th anniversary of the city we all will celebrate together in 2014, "said Minister Gendron. 
The new DESMARAIS bridge has three traffic lanes, two of which are in the east direction, two unidirectional bike bands and sidewalks on both sides of the bridge. In addition, the new structure no longer presents the curvature of the old, which represents a security gain. 
Although the new Desmarais bridge is open to traffic, the site is not completed. It remains, among other things, to dismantle the temporary bridge to a path that allowed the western circulation is during the work. The dismantling of this bridge should be completed next November. 
Minister Gendron wanted to thank all those who worked on this project. "This new infrastructure is adapted to the needs of all users. Driver, pedestrian and cyclist will find their account. It is one of the most important assets for the city of Amos, an asset it can benefit during the second century in its history. "
