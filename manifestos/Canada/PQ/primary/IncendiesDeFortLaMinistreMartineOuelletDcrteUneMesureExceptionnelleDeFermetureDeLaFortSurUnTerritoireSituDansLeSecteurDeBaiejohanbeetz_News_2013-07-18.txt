Quebec- The Minister of Natural Resources, Mrs. Martine Ouelt, announces that the forest is closed now on a territory located 40 km east of Havre-Saint-Pierre and 10 km west of Aguanish. The targeted sector, which forms a rectangle, is delineated more precisely as follows: northwest by latitude 50 ° 52 '30' 'and longitude 63 ° 05', northeast by latitude 50 ° 52 '30' 'and longitude 62 ° 15', southeast by the latitude 50 ° 15 'and longitude 62 ° 15' and, along the coast, southwest by the latitude 50 ° 16 '46' 'and longitude 63 ° 05'. This territory, however, excludes the scope of the immediate community of Johan-Beetz secure by the Forest Protection Corporation (Sopfeu). 
The location map of the affected territory is available on the department's website at www.mrn.gouv.qc.ca/en/feres-foret. 
It is a territory that is usually not closed. However, the current situation leads to exceptional measures. This is why the Minister of Natural Resources has made this decision in the interest of the safety of people. Traffic on provincial routes remains under the responsibility of the Ministry of Transport or Sûreté du Québec. 
"In this period when the flammability indices are extreme in some territories of Quebec, the utmost caution is. The collaboration of all is essential for the protection of citizens, "said Minister Martine Ouellet.
