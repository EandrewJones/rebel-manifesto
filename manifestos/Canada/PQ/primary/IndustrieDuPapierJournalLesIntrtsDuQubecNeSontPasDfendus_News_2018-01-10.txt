Quebec, on January 10, 2018 -The MP for Bonaventure and official opposition on forest, wildlife and parks, Sylvain Roy, and the Quebec-Canada relations spokesman Nicolas Marceau, Urge the Couillard government to defend more vigorously Quebec's interests in Ottawa and to reassure the 7,000 workers in the newspaper industry, which are struck by a new tax on their exports in the United States. 
IN SHORT 
"The failure of the Cuteillard Trudeau duo against the American administration is patent. So far, they have failed to enforce the commercial rights of Quebecers. The voice of Quebec is not heard at the bargaining table, and Justin Trudeau does not seem to have a priority. Yet the majority of newspaper factories are located in Quebec; Our regions will therefore be the first touched. At home, 250 municipalities live from the forest industry, and 100 depend it entirely ", insisted Nicolas Marceau. 
Sylvain Roy, for his part, calls for the responsibilities of the Quebec Minister of Forests, Luc Blanchette. "Failure to have defended the interests of Quebec, the minister must immediately ensure that a support program meets the actual needs of businesses. And, this time, it is necessary to avoid repeating the errors committed during the implementation of the program to counter the effects of the surcharge on Canadian lumber exports. It should be remembered that this program was announced in April 2017, but no one has yet had access. Obviously, he does not meet the needs of the forest industry, "said Sylvain Roy.
