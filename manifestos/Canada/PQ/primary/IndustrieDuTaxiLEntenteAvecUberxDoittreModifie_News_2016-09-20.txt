Quebec, on September 20, 2016 -Martine Ouellet, Member of Parliament for Vachon and spokespersons of the Parti Québécois for transport, asks the Committee on Transport and the Environment (CTE) to undertake a mandate of initiative. Analyzing the agreement between the government and the Uber foreign multinational. 
Ms. Ouellet supports the motion presented today by the member for Mercier, who also claims that the National Assembly takes note of the request for suspension of the pilot project with Uber, formulated by the majority of the actors of the taxi industry. 
"The agreement concluded does not respect the word given by the former Minister of Transport, Jacques Daoust, and creates two categories of taxi drivers. The new minister, Laurent Lessard, must explain this volt-face to all parliamentarians and 22,000 families affected. The Parti Québécois will continue to defend the rights of workers in the taxi industry and treatment equity, "first exposed the member for Vachon. 
"The Parti Québécois has always asked that there is an equity for treatment between UberX drivers and taxi drivers. However, currently the taxi license agreement, estimated at between $ 150,000 and $ 200,000, and provides for a small level royalties that it would take more than 200 years to compensate taxi drivers. In addition, the agreement does not require the payment of tax arrears, valued at over $ 20 million before the start of the pilot project. We must obtain answers in parliamentary committee on these elements and several others, "added Martine Ouellet. 
"It's important to remember that on this issue is not a matter of technology because all actors - drivers, taxi intermediaries and the political class - agree with new technologies. Quebec companies have developed mobile geographical location applications just as well, if not more advanced than Uber and with programmers from here in Quebec, has concluded the spokesperson.
