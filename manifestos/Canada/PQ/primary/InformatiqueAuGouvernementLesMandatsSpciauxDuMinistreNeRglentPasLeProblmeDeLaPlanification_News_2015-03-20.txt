Quebec- The hon. Member for Bonaventure and the official opposition for the information on informational resources, Sylvain Roy, deplores that the measures announced by the President of the Treasury Board, Martin Caitous, to fight against illegal practices in the granting Computer contracts, do not solve the lack of planning of the Government of Quebec with respect to management in this area. 
"The mandates entrusted to the permanent unit anti-corruption (UPAC) and the Auditor General (VG) do not bring any solution to the problem many times decried by the VG in its recent reports, the absence of an overall vision and Clear orientations in the management of computer contracts in government, "said Sylvain Roy. 
The hon. Member for Bonaventure believes that the UPAC arrests last week, last week, give the government to address the immediate problems of informational resources, such as the loss of internal expertise and the lack of competition between Bidder companies. 
"We believe that the solution passes, among other things, through the hiring of great specialists with a sense of ethics and respect for the irreproachable state to fill the strategic positions, so that the important IT projects are rigorously coordinated. Unfortunately, the ads made by the Liberal government do not offer anything to address information about information resources, which cost a fortune to Quebec taxpayers each year. However, when the Parti Québécois was in power, we started an important work of revising contractual practices in computer science. Where is this site? The member for Bonaventure wondered. 
"Specific and short-term solutions should be accompanied by a global and long-term planning of the management of computing contracts to the government. For this reason, we ask the Coiteux Minister to quickly trigger an investigation on this subject in order to shed light on the whole problem, "concluded Sylvain Roy.
