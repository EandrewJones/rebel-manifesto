Quebec- While, for infrastructure projects in Quebec, the negotiations with Ottawa do not succeed, the member for Jonqui√®re and Leader of the Official Opposition, Sylvain Gaudreault, arrested Liberal Prime Minister Philippe Couillard so that the Money due to Quebec is quickly available for our municipalities. 
"In a context where Quebec has lost 10,000 jobs for a year, we would have expected the government to insist maximum in its negotiations to get the hundreds of millions of dollars that come back to us and sleep in Ottawa. There are currently a value of $ 14 billion, and representing thousands of jobs, waiting to be supported to start. During this time, federal infrastructure funds are available for virtually all provinces except Quebec. After two years of procrastination, can the Prime Minister explain to Quebeckers why the government has still not signed an agreement with Ottawa? Asked Sylvain Gaudreault. The official opposition leader has, more specifically, identified the provincial-territorial floors, projects of national, regional and local importance of the Building Canada program, which represents $ 1.6 billion for Quebec. 
"The Prime Minister boasts of having increased the number of contracts without a call for tenders and reducing transparency for citizens. So, in addition to harming the fragile trusted link, it does nothing to try to solve the problems that already exist. This morning before the UMQ, he had nothing to say to the municipal elected officials. Quebec needs good economic news. We ask the Prime Minister to tell us what does not work with Ottawa. Between federalists, they should agree; That's what we are told all the time! But, in the meantime, it is lost from jobs in Quebec and projects that could create are blocked. What are the unacceptable conditions set by Ottawa and preventing projects from moving forward to Quebec? Insisted Sylvain Gaudreault.
