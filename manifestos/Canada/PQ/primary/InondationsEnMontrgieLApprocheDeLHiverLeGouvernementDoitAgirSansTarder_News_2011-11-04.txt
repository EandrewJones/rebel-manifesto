Quebec - Member for Iberville, Marie Bouillé, as well as the member for Saint John, Dave Turcotte, arrested this morning at the National Assembly the Minister of Public Safety concerning the floods of this spring in Montérégie. 
"Citizens are poorly informed about aid programs and opportunities available to them. A few weeks ago, the minister set up a special team without informing the victims of the way to access it. Several disasters do not know that they are entitled to a second assessment. All this information must be broadcast. Public safety should hold public information sessions to further inform the victims, "said the member for Saint John. 
"Several folders hang along. Indeed, many disasters have not started the work of their home yet because they are waiting for a second assessment. I repeat, we are in November! It is unacceptable that after all these announcements from the Ministry the victims are still left to themselves, "watched the member for Iberville. 
"We hope that the interpellation will have made aware of the minister and his team of the magnitude of the problems still live the victims of the Montérégie. Every week, we receive calls from victims awaiting government assistance. It is in their name that we challenged the minister this morning. Now we want to see results on the ground so that the victims finally find their quality of life, "concluded Dave Turcotte.
