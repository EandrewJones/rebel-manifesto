Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu - "The month of October arrives and the draft decree relating to a special intervention area on the territories affected by the floods is always waiting," said the hon. Member for Iberville , Marie Bouille. "The victims of last spring have seen all colors. They have neither the time nor the energy to undergo administrative slowness, "she added. 
"The absence of a decree, it means that the victims have still not had a license to rebuild. Autumn has arrived this week and winter will not be long. We ask the minister to hurry, "said official opposition on municipal affairs, Daniel Ratth√©. 
"Every day, citizens waiting for a license calls to my constituency office for information on the decree draft. Unfortunately, at the Minister's office, no one is able to provide us with a date for the adoption of the decree. Citizens are left in a void of information and they are desperate, "honored the member for Iberville. 
"There are still people living at the hotel or in trailers. At the rate where things go, they will not have time to rebuild or make the renovations necessary for their home before the gel. Citizens have suffered enough like that. The minister must reassure the victims, "continued the member for Saint-Jean, Dave Turcotte. 
For the member for Chambly, Bertrand St-Arnaud, it is imperative that municipalities be put in the shot: "They need time to put everything in place and grant licenses. As the population, they are rightly impatient. The minister must immediately inform the population and municipalities of the continuation of things, "concluded the member.
