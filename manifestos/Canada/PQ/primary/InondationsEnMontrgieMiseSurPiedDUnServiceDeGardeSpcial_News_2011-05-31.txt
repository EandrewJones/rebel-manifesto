Quebec -The member for Saint-Jean, Dave Turcotte, anxious to help concretely to the victims of Montérégie, announced this afternoon the establishment of a free custody service for the victims during the great chores of the next weekends. This initiative was taken in concert with the regional and family child care managers. 
"Since the beginning of the floods, the affected relatives are overwhelmed, the children are disoriented and need to change the ideas. That's why we joined partners and with them we organized a child care service that will help parents at the two weekends of Large Chores, "said the member for Saint John. 
"The Montérégie region has been proven for 38 days now. The magnitude of the damage is such that the victims no longer know where to start. By offering such a service, we believe we can bring them a little help, allowing them to catch their breath and resume over, "continued Dave Turcotte. 
"The service we put in place will be safe, supervised by professional service professionals and will be stimulating for children who also feel the backlit for this natural disaster. By offering them days of entertainment, animation, makeup, circus workshops and other surprises, we want to put a balm on the stress they have lived lately, "added the member. 
"Other partners have joined our initiative. The city of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu will offer free place and playgrounds to hold the event and parents-relief will ensure the safety of the premises, "he added. 
Dave Turcotte was accompanied by Ms. Manon-Hélène Desjardins, Executive Director of Family in Heart, Ms. Sandra Landry, owner of SOS Custody Service Manager, Mrs. Mélanie Dion, President of the Alliance of Family Stakeholders, Ms. Chantal Robinson, Vice-President of the Alliance of Family Stakeholders, and Lucie Lafond, Treasurer of the Alliance of Family Stakeholders (ADIMSQ).
