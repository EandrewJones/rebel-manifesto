Quebec- The member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, denounces the inadmissible attitude of Canada Post in the case of the installation of Community mailboxes in the territory of the municipalities Quebec. 
"Once again, we have an example of a Crown corporation that is shamelessly abusing the powers conferred on it by Canadian laws. Canada Post Installs, without consulting anyone, concrete slabs even in parks. This way of doing things demonstrates all the arrogance of the federal government from Quebecers and Quebeckers. Federal Political Party leaders must immediately order Canada Post to work with people and municipalities involved, rather than imposing their wishes, "said Stéphane Bergeron. 
"The most through the case of Canada Post is far from being an isolated case. In several other cases, Quebeckers and Quebeckers are not fully masters of their territory. For example, Quebec will have no decision-making power in the Expansion of the Port of Quebec. Also report the intransigence of the National Energy Board, particularly in the energy pipeline file is. Even companies under federal jurisdiction, such as CN, can impunity ignore Quebec's requirements related to their operations, "added the member for Verchères. 
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister of Quebec does not even deign to impose on the federal government with the aim of enforcing the prerogatives of Quebec. "Where is Philippe Couillard, while federal agencies go through their jurisdictions? Does its radical federalism prevent it from intervening in favor of citizens of Quebec? Stéphane Bergeron concluded.
