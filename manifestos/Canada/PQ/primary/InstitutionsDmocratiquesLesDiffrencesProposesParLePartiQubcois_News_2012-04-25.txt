Québec- "On February 15, we announced measures that are important to us, to the Parti Québécois, in order to restore confidence to citizens and to calm the political crisis caused by too many years in the power of the Liberal Party of Jean Charest. In light of the light marketing survey seemed yesterday in the newspaper of Quebec and the newspaper of Montreal, we thought of reminding these proposals to the citizens and to ask the government to manifest a certain openness towards them, in vain, " Affirmed from the entry of play The member for Chicoutimi and the official opposition spokesman for democratic institutions, Stéphane Bédard. 
"The scandals in which the Liberals have been bathing for several years have something to worry about the population. After three mandates, Jean Charest will have accomplished one thing: he will have led cynicism towards the political class to his paroxysm. When ministers under-dealing with engineering firms their financing cocktails, it is high time that things change, "added Stéphane Bédard. 
A government of the Parti Québécois will limit the influence of money within political parties. We are committed to the maximum political contribution of $ 100 and that the tax credit for political contribution is eliminated. "We are now thinking about setting up completely public funding at zero cost to the population. Liberal scandals lead us in this direction and their refusal to discuss our proposals to be worried even more, "continued the member. 
"We have also been proposing for more than two years to limit the mandate of the Prime Minister and that of the municipal elected officials, a proposal that the Liberals also refuse, stubbornly, without us understanding what it caches", concluded Stéphane Bédard.
