Quebec, on December 19, 2016 -The spokesperson for the Quebecois Party for Digital Policy and Economics and Electronic Commerce, as well as Culture and Communications, Martine Ouellet, considers that the announcement of the program " Quebec trendy ", made today by the Minister responsible for the digital strategy, Dominique Anglade, is far from satisfying expectations. 
"Nearly 300,000 Quebec households would not have high speed internet right now. We are soon in 2017; Access to this service is now essential for both the development of regions of Quebec and for SMEs, families, training or teleworking. In 2011, the Liberal government estimated the needs in this area at almost one billion dollars over 10 years; The investment of 100 million announced today is obviously not enough, "denounced Martine Ouellet. 
The spokesperson also recalls the disastrous record of the Liberal government for the regions. "After the destruction of their tools for economic development, and despite the dossiers of lumber, interurban transport, proximity forests and erosion of the banks, which sleep on a tablet, now a Montreal Minister announces A meager 100 million for the deployment of a high speed internet service in rural areas. What are its objectives? How many households expects? She plugs with this sum? In some MRCs du Qu√©bec, the cost of connecting is $ 30 million; The available sums will therefore be largely insufficient. However, the Liberal government must ensure that all regions, that all citizens have access to high speed Internet, "she concluded.
