Trois-Rivières- The Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks and Minister responsible for the Regions of Mauricie and Center-du-Québec, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet, on behalf of the Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the Territory, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announces the commissioning of the roundabout at the intersection of Route 155 and the 90th Avenue (Route 153) in Shawinigan, Saint-Georges-de-Champlain sector, since yesterday morning. 
The intersection of Route 155 and the 90th Avenue, borrowed daily by a large number of vehicles, proves to be suitable for such development. There are 9,700 vehicles a day on Route 155 while 9600 vehicles take daily 90th Avenue. 
"I look forward to setting up this new infrastructure. The formula has already proven itself in several places in the world, particularly in Quebec, the new roundabout will help reduce the number and severity of accidents, while promoting the fluidity of traffic in this sector, "said the Yves-François Blanchet. 
Recall that a roundabout is a development that includes one or more traffic lanes surrounding a central island. The circulation in these paths is in the opposite direction to the needles of a watch. In addition, users who want to engage in a crossroads must give way to the vehicles that already circulate there. 
Information about crossroads are also available on the Transport Quebec website: (http://www.mtq.gouv.qc.ca/portal/page/portal/entreprises/camencion/reseau_rouier/carrefours_girl)
