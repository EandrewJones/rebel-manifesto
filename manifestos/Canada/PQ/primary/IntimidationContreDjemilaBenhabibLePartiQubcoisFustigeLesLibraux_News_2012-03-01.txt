Benoît Dutrizac and Richard Martineau denounced these unacceptable threats. We, to the Parti Québécois, have always defended freedom of opinion and freedom of the press. The Liberals must be explained! How can they use the argument of the time of sending the motion, when they had to know about the problem in the newspapers this morning?
