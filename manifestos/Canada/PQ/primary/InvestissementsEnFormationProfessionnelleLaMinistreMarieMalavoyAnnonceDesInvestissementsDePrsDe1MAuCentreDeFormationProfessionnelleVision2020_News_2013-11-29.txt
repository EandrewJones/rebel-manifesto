Quebec- The Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Marie Malavoy, accompanied by the Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks and Minister responsible for the Center-du-Québec Region, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet, today announced that $ 1,000,000 investments would be made at the Vision 20 Vision 20, from the Bois-Francs School Board. 
The CFP Vision 20 20 will thus be able to carry out the expansion and implementation work required to comply with the requirements of study programs assistance to the health facility (5316), assistance to the person at home (5317) Esanté Nursing assistance and care (5325), three programs offering good job prospects. This work should be completed in the spring of 2015. 
"These investments, we do them for Quebec youth. We have every advantage that vocational training attracts them more. We must also bring even more adults to explore the multiple possibilities it offers. Vocational training is not only essential for the development of our economy, but it allows young people who follow her to be accomplished in areas that are important to them, "said Malavoy Minister. 
Government investments totaling more than $ 24.3 million were announced in September 2013 to improve the vocational training offer. In addition to the project announced today, various other projects aimed at the expansion and redevelopment of existing vocational training centers and the updating and implementation of new curricula will be implemented in several regions of Quebec. 
"Our region is pampered in terms of government investments in the vocational training sector: this year, nearly $ 9 million will be invested in improving the curricula and facilities they require. This clearly demonstrates that education is a real instrument of development for the regions of Quebec. I am very proud to be associated with these government decisions, "the Minister Blanchet concluded.
