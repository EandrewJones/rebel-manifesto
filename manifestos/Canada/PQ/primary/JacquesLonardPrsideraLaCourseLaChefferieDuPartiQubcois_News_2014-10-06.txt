Sherbrooke- The National Conference of the Presidents and the Presidents of the Parti Québécois chose Mr. Jacques Leonard to preside over the race to the party chieftaincy. 
"Mr. Leonard has long service states in the Quebecois party and has been respected by all members. His extensive experience in the National Assembly, as to the Council of Ministers, makes him the person indicated to carry out this operation. We thank him for accepting, "said Quebec's president, Raymond Archambault. 
"His mandate will be to enforce the rules adopted today, to establish the links with the representatives of the different campaigns and to ensure the fair treatment of all candidates. A figure such as Jacques Leonard, whose probity is no longer to be demonstrated, has become naturally imposed, "he continued. 
"It is with pleasure that I agree to serve the Québécois party again. A race to the chieftaincy is an exhilarating moment, where many ideas are put forward. Obviously, for members as for candidates, it is important that the rules are followed scrupulously and that all have equitable access to the resources of the Parti Québécois. I will make sure, "concluded Jacques Leonard.
