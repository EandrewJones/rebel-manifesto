Quebec- While thousands of parents form human chains around Quebec schools to demonstrate their attachment to the public network, hard hit by liberal cuts, the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and spokespersons of the Parti Quebec. primary and secondary education and school perseverance, Nicole Léger, challenges the Minister of Education, François Blais, in order to stop compressions that affect the services to students and that you make the success of young people priority. 
"What truly concerns parents is the quality of education offered to the children of Quebec, not the technocratic reforms that the minister is simmering. What we need in Quebec is not a bureaucrat minister who plays in the structures, but a leader who goes on the ground and who really cares about student success, "said Nicole Lightweight. 
Since his election, in April 2014, the Liberal Party has cut into the purchase of books, services to children in learning difficulty, homework help, etc. Recall also that he wants to increase the number of students by class and reduce the resources dedicated to young people with disabilities. "The government puts the ax in education, dramatically increases the invoice for child care and, after that, the minister is surprised that parents organize events. Obviously, it is totally disconnected from reality, "added the spokesman. 
"Since his appointment, we have the impression that François Blais is more the executor of the liberal compressions decreed by the Treasury Board that a true Minister of Education with the interests of young people", has concluded Nicole Léger.
