"Quebec has significant challenges. Our demography is a good example. We must be even more efficient to advance Quebec. Northern development and the maritime strategy will not be sufficient. I offer my collaboration to the Prime Minister and proposes to invite socio-economic actors to a major appointment, where we can together contribute to defining the means and priorities of a real plan of sustainable growth, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"The news of the last weeks shows that the protection of our most beautiful businesses is more than ever relevant. Whether you think of Alcan, Bombardier, Cirque du Soleil, at SNC-Lavalin ... This morning, Tembec announced the closing of 3 factories and the loss of 350 jobs. It takes leadership, Quebec. The Prime Minister must recognize the urgency of acting to better protect our florets and our headquarters, "he added. 
"The thousands of fathers and mothers who have just lost their jobs at Bombardier, at the Site Davie, at the head office of Alcan or this morning at Tembec are not statistics. The loss of a job is a difficult test for affected families. The Prime Minister can not trivialize this situation. I therefore reiterate my invitation to the Prime Minister, wishing that he takes the initiative to bring together all the actors to equip Quebec with a real political policy, "concluded the official opposition.
