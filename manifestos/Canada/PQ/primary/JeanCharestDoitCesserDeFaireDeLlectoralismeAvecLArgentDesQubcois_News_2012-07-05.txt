Quebec- Before the imminence of an electoral trigger, the official opposition leader and MP for Charlevoix, Pauline Marois, asks the Prime Minister to undertake now not to use public funds for partisan purposes. 
The announcement of a loan of $ 58 million at the Jeffrey Mine last Friday feels the electoralism at full nose. Not only is this money paid to a liberal contributor, but it will be used to finance a non-future moribund industry for the sole purpose of trying to seduce the electorate in the riding of Richmond. 
"The Prime Minister should be respectful of public funds and start now not to use Quebeckers' money to make election ads," said official opposition, demanding to know the exact nature of the Loan granted to the Jeffrey Mine. 
The people of Richmond are not fooled. Already, the mine workers were disappointed to learn that they will not be able to resume work before a year. But Jean Charest taught us not to trust this type of election ads. 
In 2007, the first day of the election campaign, Jean Charest promised $ 200 million for the revival of Kruger's Wayagamack factory in Trois-Rivières and the creation of 200 jobs. This project has not yet been achieved so far. 
A few days later in 2007, the Prime Minister promised $ 400 million for the expansion of Quebec's Hôtel-Dieu. Not only have the costs doubled for five years, but the project is not yet realized. 
In 2008, shortly before the election campaign, Jean Charest announced a $ 1.2 billion project in Bécancour for a solar panel project of the company REC Silicon. The project that needed to create 300 jobs has not yet emerged. 
"As the election campaign approach, when we see the election ads multiply, the Prime Minister must give up looking to buy his election with public funds," concluded Pauline Marois.
