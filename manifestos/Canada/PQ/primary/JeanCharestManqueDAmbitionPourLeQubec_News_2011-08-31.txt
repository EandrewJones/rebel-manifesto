Saguenay -The MP for Lac-Saint-Jean and opposition spokesperson for international relations, Alexandre Cloutier, notes once again that Prime Minister Jean Charest lacks ambition for Quebec and takes advantage of his mission in China to underestimate the interest of foreign countries for Quebec. 
"Jean Charest said today that Quebec would be less able to draw his game pin if he was a" small "sovereign country. I remind Mr. Charest that, according to the OECD indicators, 9 of the 15 richest countries have an equivalent or lower population in Quebec. It is sad that the Prime Minister does not have enough confidence in the Quebec population and that he believes that Quebec should fall back on the Canadian federation to be "interesting" in the eyes of the world, "said Alexandre Cloutier. 
It will be remembered that in 2006 the Prime Minister asserted on a trip to France that Quebec has the "means" to be a sovereign country. 
"It is surprising to hear the Prime Minister rejoice in the meetings he obtained in China, while being the Prime Minister of a simple" province ". There is nothing surprising to what Jean Charest be welcomed by arms open by investors to whom he intends to highlight the natural resources of Northern Quebec. For the Parti Québécois, it is clear that Quebec not only has the means, but also the interest of becoming a sovereign country to make its voice heard and prosper in the world, "concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
