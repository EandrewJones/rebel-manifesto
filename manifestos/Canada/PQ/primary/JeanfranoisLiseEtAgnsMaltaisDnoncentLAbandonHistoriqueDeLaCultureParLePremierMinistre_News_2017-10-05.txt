Quebec, October 5, 2017- The Leader of the Official Opposition, Jean-François Lisée, and the critician and communications spokesman, Agnès Maltese, denounce the historical renunciation of Liberal Prime Minister Philippe Couillard with respect to the full project management of Quebec in culture. 
IN SHORT 
"The Prime Minister abandons a claim that was raised by Robert Bourassa, Jean Charest, Liza Frulla and Christine St-Pierre, all agree that Quebec must hold all the resources and the power to act on The cultural plan. Philippe Couillard prefers to leave all of this in the hands of the federal government and Mélanie Joly. Moreover, the argument that it invokes, either the federal funding in relation to the Quebec population, also proved to be at the time of Robert Bourassa or Jean Charest, without these abandoning their claims. " , first reminded Jean-François Lisée. 
"In the spring, in its" Quebec affirmation policy ", Philippe Couillard took several historical requests from Quebec. But not a word in terms of culture. Nothing, either, in the project of renewal of the Quebec culture policy. Why give up struggles by Mr. Bourassa and Mr. Charest? Why follow the federal government? , Pursued Jean-François Lisée. 
"Recently, Canada has published for the first time a cultural policy. Quebec did not have any say, as well as for the agreement that Ottawa concluded with Netflix. Yet it is here that we know how to support our culture, our films, our artists, our music, our literature. It is up to us that the full powers of culture must come back, so that our craftsmen are adequately sustained, "Agnès Maltais concluded.
