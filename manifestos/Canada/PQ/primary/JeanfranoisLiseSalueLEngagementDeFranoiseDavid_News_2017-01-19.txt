Montreal, on January 19, 2017 - While Françoise David announced, today, his withdrawal of political life, the head of the official opposition, Jean-François Lisée, welcomed the commitment and passion of the member for Gouin and co-spokesman of Quebec Solidaire. 
"Having consecrated his life to the progress of the causes that held him - social justice, the environment, equality between women and men, the sovereignty of Quebec - Françoise David became one of the figures the most striking of the political landscape Quebec. Feminist activist, she worked in several groups, in addition to leading the Federation of Quebec Women. Françoise's daily feat was to give a strong voice to women, disinherited and forgotten. Among other things, its commitment to the organization of the Walk of Bread and Roses, in 1995, has largely contributed to the adoption of the Pay Equity Act, in addition to sensitizing the entire population to the fight against poverty and violence against women. We will remember, too, of his fight for the automatic perception of food pensions, "said Mr. Lisée. 
"We can only greet the immense contribution of Françoise David as a member of Parliament, and we know very well that his citizen involvement will continue well beyond parliamentary life. As elected of the National Assembly, it focused on many issues; All recently, moreover, she had a bill passed protecting vulnerable seniors from the eviction of their housing. I am convinced that this woman of conviction and dialogue will continue her struggle for the most vulnerable of our society. Everyone could see, on a daily basis, how much this woman has, in her spinal cord, the need to advance the common good. On my behalf and in that of my political training, I wish him a good retirement, well deserved. Thank you, Françoise! , Expressed the leader of the official opposition.
