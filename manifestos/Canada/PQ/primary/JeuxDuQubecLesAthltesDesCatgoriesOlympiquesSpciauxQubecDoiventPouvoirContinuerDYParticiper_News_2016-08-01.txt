Quebec- The member for Labelle and spokesperson for the Quebec sports and leisure party, Sylvain Pagé, asks the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Sébastien Proulx, to offer all the necessary support for sports Quebec for the categories "Special Olympiques Quebec" (OSQ), for young physical or intellectual disabled, not withdrawn from the programming of the Quebec Games at 2018. 
"Minister Proulx must intervene and ensure that our young athletes with disabilities can continue to participate in the Quebec Games. Their inclusion in this great multisport event is important; This allows them to strengthen their self-confidence and personal esteem, to demonstrate their will and to promote their social integration. Participate in the Quebec Games, it is an extraordinary valuation for young people, whether they are disabled or not. The experience is invariably rewarding for all and all, "exposed the member for Labelle. 
"Everyone gets along that it is essential to send an opening and inclusion message to all young Quebeckers, including those living with intellectual or physical disability. But excluding some athletes from the Quebec Games, we do exactly the opposite. The minister must encourage these young people. For them, the adventure of the Games is synonymous with hope and is a great source of motivation, "concluded Sylvain Pagé.
