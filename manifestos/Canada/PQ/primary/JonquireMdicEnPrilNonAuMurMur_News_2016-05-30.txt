Jonquière - Given the new standards negotiated between the Minister of Health and the Federation of Omnipratic Physicians of Quebec, the official Leader of the Official Opposition and MP, Sylvain Gaudreault, arrested Prime Minister of Quebec, Philippe Couillard, and Minister Gaétan bargains about the survival of Jonquière Médi, emphasizing the inefficiency of a single solution for all Quebec. 
The new agreement is changing the remuneration of doctors' acts for home visits, complicating the recruitment and retention of those who work for Jonquière Med, and even at risk the financing of services. 
"Jonquière Mede, it's a unique formula that allows you to disengorge emergencies by providing services to patients without a family doctor or those who can not have an appointment with their doctor. We are talking about 10,000 visits a year. I share the worry of the administrators of Jonquière Med. The Prime Minister must be aware that "wall-to-wall" solutions for all Quebec, it does not work! He must insist on keeping the decentralized and innovative services whose regions are acquiring to meet their specific needs, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
The leader of the official opposition recalls, in addition, the many promises broken by the Minister of Health, particularly in terms of home care. "In addition to all these cups, the Liberal government is disconnected from what is happening on the ground. The Jonquière Sédi organization shared its concerns to the Minister's Office staff and the Prime Minister, obtaining as the only answer that no change would be made to the negotiated agreement. I invite Philippe Couillard to come back to his decision and find a solution to finish, we care about maintaining the peculiarities that work in the regions, "concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
