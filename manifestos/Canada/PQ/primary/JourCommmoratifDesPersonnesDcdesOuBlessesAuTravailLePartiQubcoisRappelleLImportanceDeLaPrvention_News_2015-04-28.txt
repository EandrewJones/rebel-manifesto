Quebec- On the occasion of the commemorative day of persons deceased or injured at work, the member for Sanguinet and official opposition on the work, Alain Therrien, recalled that the health and safety of workers must remain Priorities for our society and in these areas, prevention is the key to success. 
"In this day in memory of women and men who have lost life at work, I have a special thought for their family and loved ones, and I want the wish that all the gestures required to make our workplaces Safer are made. Year after year, too many lives are broken by an accident at work. In addition, beyond the consequences on the people themselves, their families and their colleagues, each work accident means a considerable loss of expertise for the company concerned as well as important social costs. Quebec does not have the means to deprive yourself of so many talents, so many resources; He needs all his workers, "said Alain Therrien. 
However, according to the member, it is through the prevention that one can hope to decrease the number of accidents. "In the best interests of workers and employers, Quebec must continue to support efforts to strengthen a prevention culture. As much as possible, we must act to eliminate dangers within workplaces and thus avoid injury and death. Worker safety must become a corporate value, for which both employers and workers have to engage, "continued the spokesperson. 
Remember that it is under a government of the Parti Québécois that for the first time, the flag of the National Assembly has been placed in memory of the deceased workers in the performance of their duties. "This important gesture reminds us that it is unacceptable to risk its life while trying to win it," concluded Alain Therien.
