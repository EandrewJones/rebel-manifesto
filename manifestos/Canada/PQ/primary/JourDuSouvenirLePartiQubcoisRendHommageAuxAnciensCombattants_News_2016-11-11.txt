Quebec, November 11, 2016 -The 11 November 1918 was signed the armistice, which officially ended the fighting of the First World War. That day, thousands of people let out their immense joy, but others, as many, cried their dear missing. Nearly 100 years later, Jean-François Lisée, head of the official opposition, wants to keep the memory alive. 
"I come to emphasize the bravery that marked the history of Quebec regiments, a tradition that continues. The courage of the soldiers contributes powerfully to our national pride, "said the leader of the official opposition. 
In 2016, the remembrance day makes a broader sense, wanting the opportunity to pay tribute to all the people who got up and beaten to defend our democracies, and who paid it expensive. "We must remember the courage and dignity of these women and men, as well as the sacrifices they have made. A veteran said, "A veteran, it's someone who, at some point in his life, wrote a blank check to his country, for an amount going so far as to give his life", Added Jean François Lisée. 
In tribute to the soldiers wounded or missing during their military service, the head of the official opposition has deposited this morning a wreath of flowers at the cross of the sacrifice, at the entrance of the Champs-De-Battle Park, to Quebec. "The motto of Quebec, I remember, is also that of the Royal 22nd regiment, and it takes all its meaning today," concluded Mr. Lisée.
