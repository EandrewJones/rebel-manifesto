Quebec- The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Agn√®s Maltese, wishes to emphasize the day of action against sexual violence against women taking place under the theme prostitution. 
"For our government, it is important to join our efforts to ensure that in Quebec, gender equality fully materializes and that respect prevails first and foremost. Prostitution is a form of violence against women, who undermines their dignity and security. It also remains a major obstacle to the achievement of equality between women and men. In this, it is the manifestation of abuse of power that can not be tolerated in a society that defends justice and equality values, "said Maltese minister. 
The minister welcomes the involvement of women's groups to counter the forms of violence against women, including sexual exploitation. This involvement is not without inspiring government interventions in this area. 
More generally, the Quebec government has laid a number of gestures in recent years to counter violence against women. The 2008-2013 Government Action Plan for Sexual Assault, which brings together 100 commitments under the responsibility of ten signatory departments, made it possible to make significant progress. 
Among the actions arising from this plan, remember the creation of a line of reference without charge to guide the victims of sexual assault, their relatives and the environment of the appropriate services, the realization of a government campaign Awareness of sexual assault as well as the prevention of youth recruitment for sexual exploitation in a context of street gangs. 
In addition, a government action plan aimed at preventing and countering sexual exploitation should emerge by the end of 2014.
