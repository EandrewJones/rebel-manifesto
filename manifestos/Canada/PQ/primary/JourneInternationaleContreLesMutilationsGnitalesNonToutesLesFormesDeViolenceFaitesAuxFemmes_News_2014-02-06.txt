Quebec- On the occasion of the International Lander Against Genital Mutilation, the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Agn√®s Maltese, wishes to reiterate the will of the government to fight Against all forms of violence against women, including so-called crimes of genital mutilation. 
"The Government of Quebec considers genital mutilation as an attack on the physical integrity of the person and human dignity. In this regard, we currently carefully study the recommendations arising from the opinion of the Staff Regulations Council filed last November on the so-called crimes, including the elements concerning genital mutilation. These mutilations are criminal and have no place to be, "Mrs Maltais argued. 
Today, in the world, more than 125 million women and girls have undergone some form of genital mutilation, according to UNICEF. The organization evaluates that some 30 million girls are at risk of the same fate over the next decade because this practice remains common in many countries. 
Recall that the International Day Against Genital Mutilations recalls every year on February 6, that millions of girls have suffered or undergo a fundamental violation of their human rights.
