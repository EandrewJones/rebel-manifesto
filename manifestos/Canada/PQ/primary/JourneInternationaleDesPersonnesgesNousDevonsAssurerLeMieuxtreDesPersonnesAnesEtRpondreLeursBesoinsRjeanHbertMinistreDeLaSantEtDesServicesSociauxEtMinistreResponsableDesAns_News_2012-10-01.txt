"On the occasion of the International Day of the Elderly, I want to remember that the fulfillment, wellness and aging of seniors are objectives that led to my commitment to politics.

The Quebec government intends to propose concrete solutions by working, in particular, to implement a national home care policy that truly responds to the needs of seniors and creating an autonomy insurance plan. 
In addition, it is up to all the social and economic actors to bring together the favorable conditions for active and healthy aging for all elders.
