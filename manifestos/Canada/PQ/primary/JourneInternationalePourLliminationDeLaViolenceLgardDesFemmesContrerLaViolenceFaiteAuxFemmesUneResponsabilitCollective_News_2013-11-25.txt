Québec- The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Agnès Maltais, want to recall, on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence. Women, what to prevent and counter degrading gestures that reach people in their dignity is a collective responsibility. 
"Violence, regardless of its shape, is unacceptable. We must put an end to it. To get there, we have to work together. We are all responsible. It's not a problem that only concerns women, but all society, "said Minister Maltese. 
In 2012, women accounted for 80% of victims of offenses reported in a conjugal context and 83% of victims of sexual crimes. These specific cases are added other forms of violence whose women are also the main victims, including those related to honor and sexual exploitation. Thus, crimes against the person, particularly those committed against women, constitute an important part of the various police and judicial interventions in our society. 
"Over the decades, the situation of Quebec has improved in many ways. However, despite the progress made, violence continues to curb women in their search for autonomy and equality and these situations must cease, "concluded Minister Maltese.
