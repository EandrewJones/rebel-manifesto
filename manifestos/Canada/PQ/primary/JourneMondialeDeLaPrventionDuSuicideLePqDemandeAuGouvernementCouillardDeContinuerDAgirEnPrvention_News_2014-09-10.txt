Quebec- On the occasion of the 12th World Suicide Prevention Day, the member for Rosemont and the official opposition spokesman for prevention, Jean-François Lisé, asks the Minister delegated to Rehabilitation, at The protection of youth and public health, Lucie Charlebois, to intensify efforts in suicide prevention. 
The latest statistics report three suicides a day in Quebec, while only one too would be too much. It is therefore essential that the government continues to play its role in prevention, and the Parti Québécois wishes to remind him about this day of mobilization. 
"The whole society must commit to it; It is more time to support the steps of stakeholders and organizations that work every day to better prevent suicide. As for the government, it must reassure Quebeckers about the amounts invested in this matter, especially in the context of austerity and budget cuts that we know, "said Jean-Francois Lisée. Remember that in its report published on September 4th, the World Health Organization was concerned with the lack of place given to the prevention of suicide in public policies. 
The member also took the opportunity to emphasize daily efforts by the Quebec Association of Suicide Prevention Association (AQPS); His essential work really contributes to transforming, improving the lives of vulnerable people and their loved ones. However, the AQPS absolutely needs the support of the government to carry out its mission. 
Jean-Francois Lisé recalls, by closing that competent resources are available for the population, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, through the free intervention line 1 866 calls (277-3553).
