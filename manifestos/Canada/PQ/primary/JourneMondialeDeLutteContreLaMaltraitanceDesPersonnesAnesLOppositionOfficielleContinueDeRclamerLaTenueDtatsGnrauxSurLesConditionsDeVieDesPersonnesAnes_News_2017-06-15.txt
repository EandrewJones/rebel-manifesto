Quebec- The official opposition spokesman for seniors, Harold Lebel, wishes to highlight the importance of World Day to combat elderly abuse. For the occasion, the hon. Member for Rimouski reiterates his request to the Government of Quebec so that General States are held on the living conditions of the elderly. 
IN SHORT 
"I would like to take advantage of this day to highlight the importance of continuing to combat all forms of abuse targeting seniors. I think everyone agrees that Bill 115 was a step in the right direction; However, it is not believed that it will definitely settle all the problems of abuse. It saddens me to think that every week, or almost, a new case of abuse is revealed to us. A few days ago, in Drummondville, we learned that dozens of elders have been deprived of bath due to lack of staff. The attendants were simply out of breath, completely overloaded. Abuse, this includes such situations against which to fight. Cases of institutional abuse are more and more numerous, and it is the lack of resources in the network that is involved, "said Harold Lebel. 
"We know that the challenge of seniors' living conditions particularly affects Quebeckers. Every day, on the ground, people tell us that abuse must stop. This is why our request for the general states to unanimity among opposition parties and seniors' groups. I spent the last two days at the Fadoq Congress, which has more than 500,000 members; As we want the government to activate. The enthusiasm that our petition generated it also proves. In just a week, we collected nearly 12,000 signatures, "added the member for Rimouski. 
The official opposition invites people to be heard with the petition.
