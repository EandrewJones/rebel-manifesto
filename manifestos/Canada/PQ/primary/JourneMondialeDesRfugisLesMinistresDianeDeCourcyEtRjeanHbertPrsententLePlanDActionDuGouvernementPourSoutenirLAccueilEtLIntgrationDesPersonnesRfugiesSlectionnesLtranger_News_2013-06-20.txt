Réjean Hébert, have pointed out Worldwide Refugeesen with the launch of the Government of Quebec's action for the reception and integration of selected refugees abroad - 2013-2016. This launch took place at the Community and Cultural Center of the Jacques-Cartier Borough in Sherbrooke, in the presence of Mr. Serge Cardin, Member of Parliament for Sherbrooke, and many partners. Mr. Cardin represented Ms. Agnès Maltese, Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity and Minister of Labor. 
"The tradition of hospitality and hospitality of Quebec with respect to refugee persons reflects the values of solidarity, respect for human rights, equity and generosity that animate the Quebec population. Compared to countries and territories that host refugees, Quebec is fifth ranked after the United States, the rest of Canada, Australia and Sweden. Recognized all over the world as a land of immigration, Quebec grants great importance to humanitarian immigration, "said Minister Diane de Courcy. Between 2008 and 2012, Quebec welcomed 8,245 refugees covered by the state and 2,273 people who were collective sponsorship. 
The Government of Quebec Action Plan includes 21 measures that revolve around four orientations: 
This action plan is the result of the concerted work of the main departments that offer services to selected refugees abroad: the Ministry of Immigration and Cultural Communities, the Ministry of Health and Social Services, the Ministry education, leisure and sport and the Ministry of Employment and Social Solidarity. It also results from the regional consultation of the departmental, institutional and Community partners in 2011-2012 and the visits that Minister Diane de Courcy made in 2012-2013 in the 17 regions of Quebec. 
"This action plan responds to the need to rethink our services according to the needs that have evolved with the international context. In recent years, we have noted substantial changes in the profile of refugee persons. These people spent a lot of their lives in refugee camps and suffered various trauma. Their needs are great and require a better stowage between the services we offer them, "said Madame de Courcy. 
According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 43.3 million people have been displaced by force due to armed conflicts and persecution. Of these, 10.4 million are refugees recognized by the Office, 46% of which are children. 
A few days before World Refugee Day, the city of Sherbrooke welcomed 32 young Rwandans who were refugees in Congo for twenty years. They had fled Rwanda in 1994 during the genocide who was nearly a million dead. Thanks to a program of the Office of the Office for the orphans victims of this genocide, they benefited from scholarships which allow them to continue their studies and a basic medical coverage. 
"Cohesion and collaboration between the different actors are essential because they allow to propose an optimal path of integration. With this new action plan, the health and social services network will be better equipped to pursue its work on planning and organizational services for refugees and asylum seekers. He can do so in consultation with the regional actors who play a key role in the integration of refugees into Quebec society, "said Minister Réjean Hébert. 
"This action plan perpetuates Quebec's tradition of opening and generous to the most vulnerable people in our planet and we are very proud of it. Refugee welcoming is a consensus humanitarian action throughout society. We will work with our partners so that our support is up to the courage of these people who have fled the threats, persecutions and conflicts to rebuild their lives in Quebec, "concluded Minister Diane de Courcy.
