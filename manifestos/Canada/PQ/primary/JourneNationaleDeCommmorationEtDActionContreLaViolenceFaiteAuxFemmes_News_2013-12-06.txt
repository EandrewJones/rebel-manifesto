Quebec- The Prime Minister of Quebec, Pauline Marois, and the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Agn√®s Maltese, have pointed out the national commemoration and action against the violence against women. In Quebec, December 6th remains anchored in collective memory. This day commemorates the tragedy at the Polytechnic School of Montreal, in 1989, and pays tribute to the fourteen young women murdered as well as their families and their loved ones, who were marked forever. 
"This day is an opportunity to remind us that the events that occurred 24 years ago are not a reflection of our beliefs as Quebeckers. We are a people who believe in equality, which believes that girls and women are full participants in the construction of society. It is, among other things, the promotion of these fundamental values of respect for the physical and psychological integrity that we can ensure the safety of all, in all living quarters, "said the Prime Minister. 
In this sense, the government is continuing its efforts to have access to the trades of the future and can fully participate in decision-making bodies as well as economic life, especially as entrepreneurs. It also sets up many actions so that they can live safely. 
"We must make every effort so that such an event will never happen again. The fight against violence against women is a collective responsibility. On this day, let us remember this tragedy as an unacceptable event with the still painful consequences, "said Minister Maltese.
