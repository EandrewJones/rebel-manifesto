An election campaign is a stimulating and demanding period. High in color and strong emotions! It is also a time that leaves little time for personal life. Those who have already engaged in such an adventure know it. Citizen involvement and political beliefs deserve this investment. 
Pauline Marois, among all, knows it particularly well! 
That's why I find it all the more important to take a break to greet the person behind the public figure, give off a moment the policy to emphasize a particular moment of the personal life of our chef, Pauline Marois, who today celebrates his birthday today . 
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, MADAME MAROIS! 
Your determination and dedication are inspiring. On this special day, it's your turn to let you talk about love. 
As for me, I wish you the most beautiful gifts: a government of the majority Parti Party. This is what Quebec can afford itself better, it is what Quebeckers deserve: a given government, a vision of an ambitious and realistic future for a stronger, more solidarity and prosperous Quebec. A Quebec who stands up and who tells you: Thank you for all the efforts, all the determination and all the passion that you have devoted us for more than 30 years. And you, what wishes would you like to offer Ms. Marois?
