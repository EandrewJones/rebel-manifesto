Qu√©bec- The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, was surprised and very disappointed with the decision of the Court of Appeal rendered today on his claim in the record of the register firearms. The Court refused to make an order preventing the destruction of Quebec data included in the Firearms Register and requiring the federal authorities to maintain their access and update pending the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada. 
"We will table in the coming hours before the Supreme Court a request for stay that will be paired with a notice of application for leave to appeal to ensure that Quebec data are not destroyed by the federal government and remain accessible and Updates during the call. We have informed the Attorney General of Canada's lawyers of our intention to carry out a claim to prevent the destruction of data, "said Bertrand St-Arnaud. 
Remember which Government of Quebec had filed a motion to preserve and retain the recording certificates of shoulder weapons (unrestricted firearms) of Quebec citizens who are listed in the Canadian Firearms Registry.
