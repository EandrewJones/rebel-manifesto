Quebec- The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, was disappointed with the decision of the Court of Appeal made today on the register of firearms without restriction. 
The Court of Appeal thus reverses a judgment of the Superior Court which gain cause in Quebec by rendering inoperative the provision of the federal law which obliged the destruction of the data relating to the registration of firearms without restriction. 
The minister stated that he will take this decision on appeal to the Supreme Court and will immediately submit a claim to ensure that Quebec data are not destroyed by the federal government and remain accessible and updated during this appeal. 
"There is a consensus in Quebec with regard to the registration of firearms. All the political courses represented in the National Assembly defend this unanimous position and strongly oppose the decision of the federal government to abolish the gun registry. We will appeal to the Supreme Court of today's decision, "said the Minister of Justice. 
Remember that the Government of Quebec had filed a request to preserve and retain the data of the recording certificates of shoulder weapons (unrestricted firearms) of Quebec citizens who are listed in the Canadian Firearms Registry.
