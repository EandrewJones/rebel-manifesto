Quebec- The member for Duplessis and spokesperson for the Parti Quebec's Nordic Development, Lorraine Richard, is concerned about the dangerous preceding created by a judgment of the Court of Quebec, on December 18, as to the application of The tax deduction for an individual living in a distant region. 
"We have arrested this morning the Minister of Finance with regard to the Judgment of the Court of Quebec allowing workers who do Dufly-in / Fly-OUTD'Avier to the tax deduction for an individual who lives in a remote region. This judgment has created jurisprudence, a fault in the law. It is a precedent that could have important consequences in the region, but also a financial impact for the government. The purpose of the tax deduction was to create an incentive to attract families to the remote region. Granting this credit to workers in situation of Fly-in / Fly-Outva against all objectives that led to the creation of this tax measure. Thus, instead of encouraging workers and their families to settle in the region, workers who do just pass, "explained Lorraine Richard. 
"The Minister of Finance must take action without delay, by the end of the session, to plug the hole created by the December judgment. A refusal to act promptly will be interpreted as an admission that the objective of the Liberal government, that the liberal vision of Nordic development is a tax credit to reward Lefly-in / Fly-out. That's the North Plan of Philippe Couillard? ", Concluded the member for Duplessis.
