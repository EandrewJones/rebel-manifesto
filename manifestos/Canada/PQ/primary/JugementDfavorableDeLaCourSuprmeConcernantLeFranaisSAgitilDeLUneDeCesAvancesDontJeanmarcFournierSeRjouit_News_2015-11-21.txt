Quebec- In response to the judgment of the Supreme Court, which gives the right to Alberta and the Saskatchewan to enact their laws and regulations only in English, the spokesperson for the Quebec party in Quebec-Canada and Francophonie of America, Stéphane Bergeron, and the spokesman for the Charter of the French Language, Maka Kotto, find that Canadian bilingualism still remains and always an illusion. 
"This decision comes to weaken the rights of Francophones outside Quebec, which remain insufficient. From now on, the highest judicial authority confirmed that it is acceptable for Francophones do not have access to official documents in their language. Meanwhile, Jean-Marc Fournier is eulical to repeating whoever wants to hear that the Canadian Francophonie is doing better. I can not wait to see how it will take it to minimize this obvious hind. I hope that Alberta and Saskatchewan will want to show the opening needed to go further than what the judgment is prescribed, in order to allow Francophone litigants to properly defend their rights in their territory, "said Stéphane Bergeron . 
"Quebec, whose official language is French, has always shown the greatest respect for the English minority. It is deplorable that Francophones outside Quebec are not entitled to the same respect as the Anglophones du Québec, which benefit from institutions providing services in their language, "concluded Maka Kotto.
