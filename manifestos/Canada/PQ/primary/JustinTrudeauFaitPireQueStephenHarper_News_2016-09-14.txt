Quebec, on September 14, 2016 -The MP for Verchères, Chief Executive Officer Whip and Quebec Party Spokesman in Quebec-Canada, Stéphane Bergeron, and the member for Taillon and spokesperson Health, Diane Lamarre, inscurus against the fact that the federal government plans to maintain the reductions in Harper government health transfers, in addition to adding conditions. 
"In election campaign, Justin Trudeau has won support by denouncing the conservative party's health cuts. Today, we discover that the honeyed promises of the Canadian Prime Minister were only wind. Not only Ottawa maintains the reductions but, in addition, it adds conditions to transfers. It's just unacceptable! Stéphane Bergeron said. 
"One thing is certain: Quebeckers are best placed to determine where their health needs are. In addition, the Trudeau government literally links in an exclusive field of competence of Quebec. This money is not that of the federal government, but that of the population of Quebec, which is too often forgotten. And neither Gaétan barrette nor Philippe Couillard can not prevent the federal government from imposing its views, "added Diane Lamarre. 
"Before his arrival, Justin Trudeau has repeatedly told you want a dialogue with Quebec and the provinces. We now see his true face: a centralizing prime minister, who does not respect the skills of the Government of Quebec, yet much better position than him for his own health needs. Is it necessary to remember that the federal government does not handle a single civilian hospital? Faced with such an attitude, it would be more than time that the Liberal government of Philippe Couillard finally transpires a spine! ", Concluded the member for Verchères.
