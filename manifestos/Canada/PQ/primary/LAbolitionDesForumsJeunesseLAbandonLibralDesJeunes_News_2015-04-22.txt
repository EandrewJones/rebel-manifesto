Quebec- The member for Saint-Jean and the official opposition spokesman for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, deplored the Government of Quebec's decision to abolish the forums regional youth. 
"It's the end of an important model of consultation in all regions of Quebec. Youth forums are animated by a succession engaged in its environment, with the social and public issues of its community. Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, head of the youth files, was not even present when his government proceeded to this sad announcement. What has he done for youth since his arrival? , Asked the spokesman. 
"We undress stone to dress Paul, but with fewer resources. We have always defended youth-employment crossroads and we will continue to do so. However, we are looking for today the important expertise of the forums in terms of governance and citizen participation, among others. This decision is all the more sad as it occurs the same day when the National Assembly points out the 75th anniversary of the right to vote and the eligibility of women; Indeed, more than 60% of the members of the boards of directors of the youth forums are women, "added Dave Turcotte. 
The member also stresses that budgets granted to the Regional Youth Investment Fund, administered by and for young people, are diminished by this liberal decision. This is a cup of $ 5 million. 
"This way of doing things, it has already seen: we abolish a regional consultation tool, and we transfers less money to another. At the end of the line, it is the citizens who lose on the exchange. Obviously, the Liberal government has only to do with consultation. We can only deplore these ways of acting, including having long allowed the uncertainty before finally abolishing the youth forums, "concluded the member for Saint John.
