Quebec, October 16, 2014 - The member for Verchères and the official opposition spokesperson for Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, as well as the member for Matane-Matapédia and Public Safety Spokesperson, Pascal Bérubé, ask the Liberal government to intervene with the federal government so that the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) collaborates and transmitting information to the City of Montreal police service, just as it does with the Other police officers in Quebec. 
"The CRA contests the order of a justice of the peace. Instead of going to the courts, it should obey and collaborate. We also stop the Federal Revenue Minister, Kerry-Lynne D. Findlay, so that the CRA transmits all relevant information to Quebec police bodies. For a better fight against crime and tax evasion, we are entitled to expect a full collaboration of the CRA, "said Stéphane Bergeron. 
MPs call for Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs Ministers, Jean-Marc Fournier, and Public Safety, Lise Thériault, to intervene directly with their federal counterparts so that the Harper Government reminds the CRA. 
"The fight against underground economies requires full cooperation between the police authorities and the CRA. Why refuse to collaborate with the Montreal police officers? Should we understand that for the federal authorities, the police officers of Quebec are not as reliable as the RCMP? With the many surveys of fraud currently underway in Quebec, all stakeholders need to be involved in order to be made, "concluded Pascal Bérubé.
