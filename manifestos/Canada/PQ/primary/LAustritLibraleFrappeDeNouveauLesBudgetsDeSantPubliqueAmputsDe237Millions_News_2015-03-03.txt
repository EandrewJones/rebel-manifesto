Quebec- The member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, the protection of youth, home care and prevention, Jean-François Lisée, and the member for Taillon and spokesperson Health and accessibility of care, Diane Lamarre, denounce cuts of $ 23.7 million in public health that will be imposed on regions from April 1st. 
"Regardless of the economy they can represent for the government in the short term, these cups inevitably have serious consequences in the medium and long term for the health of our population and for the finances of Quebec. The regional public health directorates should probably be cut into their services, as more than 30% of their budgets will be amputated, "said Jean-François Lisée. 
Recall that last September, when submitting the bill 10, the Minister announced his intention to cut 20 million in public health; It is now learned that it puts the ax again in an essential program and additional 3.7 million. It's unjustifiable. 
"Public health is, among other things, the vaccination, the supervision of infectious diseases, such as Ebola, to smoking prevention, breast cancer screening, or the support provided to the community of lake. Megantic after the tragedy of July 2013. These examples show us that we do not cut in the structures, as we would like to believe, but in the heart of actions that have a positive effect on our daily life. These cups are another bad choice of the government in health. Already underfunded in Quebec, public health is far from being an expense; It is rather an investment. The current government, led by doctors, should promote it and not amputating, "added Diane Lamarre. 
For every dollar invested in prevention and public health, the return is undeniably higher than the investment. For example, a dollar invested in the fight against smoking reports 20 dollars. "Where is the logic that guides the choices of this government? Why cut investments that report as much? The members are wondering.
