Quebec- The member for Labelle and sentence of the official opposition in terms of recreation and sports, Sylvain Pagé, as well as the member for Joliette and spokesperson for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, ask the Minister Education, Recreation and Sport, Yves Bolduc, to take the example of his colleague Jacques Daoust and to retreat on the liberal austerity measures that will affect the National Day of Quebec. 
"This possible 20% cup of budgets, as early as 2016, jeopardizes the important aspects of the national holiday in all regions, including the neighborhood parties and those that take place in small towns and are aimed at families. These holidays are very important to gather all Quebeckers and all Quebeckers, especially those who have just settled here. Amateurism and improvisation of the Liberals continue. Minister Bolduc must confirm the maintenance of National Day budgets, "said Sylvain Pagé. 
The hon. Member also recalls that in 2004, the Liberal government of Jean Charest had also cut the subsidies dedicated to the National Day by 15%. "Why do the Liberals always do to the Quebec pride? ", he added. 
"All that affects Quebec's identity, all that makes our difference, is swept from the reverse by this government, whether culturally, linguistic, social or economic. After the abolition of the research chairs on culture and language, the cancellation of the collegial history course, the government's refusal to use the suffix .Quebec, the Prime Minister's speech only on The international scene is the turn of the National Day to pay for the Liberal government's willingness to make Quebec a province like the others, "concluded Véronique Hivon.
