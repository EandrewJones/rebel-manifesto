Québec- The member for Rousseau and the official opposition on the finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, has taken note of the report of the Quebec Tax Review Board, presided over by Luc Godbout. 
"We are open to discussion and debate on possible improvements to bring to our taxation. That being, there are lines to be traced; For example, we refuse any increase in QST. We are already the place in North America where the sales tax is highest; An increase would hurt the trade of our businesses and would escape consumers. The report also proposes to increase electricity tariffs and the gas tax in a very important way. The middle class families would be attacked directly by these measures, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
The hon. Member recalls that the government has promised to lower taxes, not to raise taxes, and this promise was not accompanied by a condition. It also emphasizes that the tax burden of Quebecers rolled up more than $ 6 billion under Jean Charest, and nearly 1 billion, already under the government of Philippe Couillard. 
"We do not trust when the Liberals say they want to make changes to taxation, while maintaining the aggregate burden unchanged; These are "taxers" compulsive! Added Nicolas Marceau. 
The Parti Québécois is open to debates 
The spokesperson also stated that his political training was open to debates on Quebec taxation. The principles guiding this opening are simple: 
"The government wants a debate; We are debating, therefore, presenting clear principles, for the benefit of the middle class, families, companies and the economy of Quebec. We will not accept a new liberal increase in the QST. In terms of equity, increase taxes in return from a decline in taxes, it is up to seek more than the middle class and low-income households, while giving gifts to the rich, "concluded Nicolas Marceau.
