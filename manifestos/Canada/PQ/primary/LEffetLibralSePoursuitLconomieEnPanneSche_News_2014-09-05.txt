Quebec- In the light of recent employment figures for the month of August, the member for Saint John and the official opposition spokesperson for employment, Dave Turcotte, and the member for Saint-Jérôme and spokesperson for economy, Pierre Karl Péladeau, find that the situation stagnates in Quebec since the arrival of the Liberal government. They therefore ask him again to deposit, from the beginning of the parliamentary school, a plan to support economic development and job creation. 
"It has been created only 4100 part-time jobs in August, what to add the loss of 1800 full-time jobs. Employment, in Quebec, continues its tumbling since the Liberal Party to power. Indeed, since April, it has lost 49,100 full-time jobs. All indicators are red; What does the government expect to act? "Said Dave Turcotte. 
The member stresses again the loss of nearly 300 jobs in Shawinigan, following the announcement of the next closure of the Laurentide Forest Products factory resolved. "All the government did is cut 17 million in employment aid measures and find a new name for an approach that already existed in Quebec investment. In short, the Liberals are trying to hide their lack of vision through a new smoke screen, "continued Dave Turcotte. 
Pierre Karl Péladeau says that the Liberal government has thrown several economic development policies on the bin by the Parti Québécois government. "The logic of liberal austerity, coupled with the inaction of the Prime Minister to defend the interests of Quebec against Ottawa - all with the tacit support of the CAQ - is harmful for job creation in Quebec. The government must quickly get out of denial and file a clear plan for economic development to support our regions, our families and our workers, "concluded the hon. Member for Saint-Jérôme.
