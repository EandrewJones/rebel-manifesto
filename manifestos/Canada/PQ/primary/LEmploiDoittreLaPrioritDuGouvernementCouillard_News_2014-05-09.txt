Quebec- The member for Sanguinet and the official opposition on the work and pension plans, Alain Therrien, believes that the Liberal government must devote all its energy to the creation of jobs in Quebec and not lock up only in a logic of austerity. 
"The government should not forget its duty to stimulate job creation in all regions of Quebec. The austerity in which he wants to dive is a significant risk in this chapter, "said Alain Therien. 
The latest statistics, published today, indicate that rigorous work must be done. Economic lapolitics Priority employment The Marois government contained several clear guidelines on Quebec's economic development. 
"We still do not know what the government intends to do about economic priority policy, set up by the Parti Québécois. We learn this morning that the Gazelles program is at risk. This program is exactly intended to support 300 SMEs, among the best and most promising, in order to promote job creation in all regions of Quebec, "added Alain Therien. 
The Liberal government should quickly indicate what it plans to cut into economic development programs. 
"We only intend to talk about compressions since the arrival of this government. We hope now that he speaks to us about employment and economic development. Our expectation is high as to the next budget; The requests we make must be taken into account, "concluded the member for Sanguinet.
