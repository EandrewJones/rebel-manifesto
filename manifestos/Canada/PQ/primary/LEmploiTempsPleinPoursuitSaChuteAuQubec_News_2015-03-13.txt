Quebec- The member for Saint-Jérôme and sentence of the official opposition in terms of economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, the member for Saint-Jean and spokesperson of employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, as well as the member for Rousseau and spokesperson in finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, deplore that full-time employment continues to come back In Quebec under the Liberals, while it increases in the rest of Canada. 
"Workers and their families are faced with many business closures and retail establishments, while the government adopts the liberal technique of leaving. As in several sectors of the state, the measures to stimulate employment are victims of Liberal-Caquist austerity, "said Dave Turcotte. 
"Since the coming to the power of the Liberal government, it has lost 12,800 full-time jobs. Regions, families, SMEs: with the liberal effect, they are all losers. Contractors no longer trust, which brakes investment and full-time job creation. When will the government wake up? We need a real policy of economic development, "added Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"Again this week, the Royal Bank confirmed that the austerity of the Couillard government slows Quebec's economy and the progress of employment. Not only does the government cut everywhere but, moreover, it opens the door all a new increase in the QST. It is the liberal method at its best: to promise, in the election campaign, not to weigh down the tax burden of Quebecers, but govern by increasing it, "concluded Nicolas Marceau.
