Quebec- The Marois Government has tabled today its Mining Royalty Backgrounder in anticipation of the Forum on the subject to be held on March 15th. "The new regime must ensure that all Quebeckers are taking out their fair share and take full advantage of the value of resources available on their territory. He must also allow businesses active in Quebec to be competitive, "said Quebec Prime Minister. 
Two main principles are put forward to guide the government's action in its reform. First, each company that will exploit a mine in Quebec will have to pay a minimum fee to the Quebec government. Also, the mining tax system will have to be amended in such a way that, when the benefits of mining companies increase, all Quebeckers take advantage of a larger share of these benefits. 
The information document provides a global portrait of the current Quebec mining sector and it deals with the functioning of the mining tax system currently in force. It will supply reflections during the forum. On this occasion, participants will be invited to give their opinion and propose changes to the plan to promote collective enrichment.
