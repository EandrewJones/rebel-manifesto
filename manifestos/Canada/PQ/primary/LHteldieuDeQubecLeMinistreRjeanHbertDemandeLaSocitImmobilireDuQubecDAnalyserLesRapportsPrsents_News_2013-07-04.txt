Quebec- "The Chu de Québec and the Capitale National Health and Social Services Agency have introduced to me their respective reports today on the future of the hospital's sites of the Child Jesus and of the Quebec City Hôtel-Dieu. I will take the time to analyze them carefully, so as to reach the best decision on the different real estate solutions possible for the modernization and expansion of the Quebec Hotel-Dieu. To do this, I asked the Quebec Real Estate Company to appreciate the proposed scenarios, including the cost and timelines, "said the Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for seniors, Réjean Hébert. 
The report of the Agency is entitled to reuse the current premises of the hotel-Dieu de Québec and that Duchu of Quebec, potential study of the child-Jesus site. Until 2012, these two hospitals were of different jurisdictions, the Quebec University Hospital and the Québec Universitaire Hospital Center which, from their merger, are gathered within the CHU of Quebec. 
"Anyway, the CHU of Quebec, the Capitale-National Health and Social Services Agency and the Ministry of Health and Social Services will demonstrate all the necessary rigor for the purpose of Registration for the Quebec Infrastructure Plan of the best possible project, in clinical, real estate and budgetary angles, "added Minister Hébert. 
Remember that Minister Hébert had clearly stated in his letter from March 13 to the CHU of Quebec, that any new real estate solution had to present added value for the clientele and the population, to show a broad consensus and ultimately, respect the ability to pay Québec taxpayers. In addition, it was necessary to preserve the historical vocation of the Hotel-Dieu de Québec by offering, on the site left potentially vacant, medical services, while adding activities to maintain the economic activity of Old Quebec.
