Quebec, August 17, 2016 -The member for Bourget and spokesman for Immigration and Cultural Communities, Maka Kotto, deplores the inconsistency of the Liberal government, who wishes to increase the immigration thresholds, while He continues to cut in the budgets dedicated to the francization and integration of people who choose Quebec as a hostland. 
"Recent studies, extremely well-documented, all point in the same direction: the unemployment rate, in Quebec, is twice as high among immigrant people. Access to integration services varies from place to place, and francization measures are not sufficiently funded; Now, knowledge of the French language is the keystone of successful integration in Quebec. The situation is worrying and should bring the prime minister to show realism in the planning of thresholds, "said the member for Bourget. 
"The consultations to which we are witnessing today will allow the government to rule on the increase or not of the immigration thresholds. On the other hand, the government did not ask the fundamental question: considering the limited amounts that it itself has chosen to devote to the reception of newcomers, how many immigrant people can reasonably hope to integrate and Francize successfully Every year in Quebec? , "Added the spokesman. 
"Some, in their obsession with mass immigration, are more concerned about the weight of Quebec within Canada than by the success of the integration of immigrant persons. We think, however, that we must act intelligently; If we have to stabilize the threshold at its current level or decline it, it is because the Quebec state does not invest pretty, quite well, in integration and francization, "concluded Maka Kotto.
