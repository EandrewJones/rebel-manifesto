I announced it this morning: a government of the Parti Québécois will engage Quebec on the road to energy independence. From the beginning of his term, the Parti Québécois will adopt a new energy strategy to free ourselves from foreign oil. 
We have the ambitious goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 25%, which is consistent with the international scientific consensus. In addition, we are approaching the breaking point where oil demands will exceed the production capacities. 
The era of cheap oil price is behind us. It costs more and more expensive, and we all know very well that it will not improve. We can see what costs a full of gas. The high price of oil is expensive individually and collectively. 
We can not continue to go into debt by refusing to look at the problem in front. We must act responsibly. And act responsibly, in this case is to free ourselves from our dependence on the importation of oil. 
Currently, we do not produce oil, we need to import it. We create jobs abroad. Our commercial deficit is $ 24 billion a year. To buy oil, we have to go out 13 billion of our economy. It's so much money that should stay in Quebec to stimulate our economy. 
We must start by seriously reducing our demand for hydrocarbons, and Quebec is well placed to do so. We have a high hydroelectric potential, wind, solar and bioenergetic. Several countries envy us! 
Transportation electrification will be at the heart of our strategy. We are able to manufacture such vehicles and we have electricity. In addition, by investing in public transport and electrification, we will create jobs with us. 
Energy will be for all states around the world the most important strategic issue in the 21st century. The Parti Québécois has made the choice of the green economy. Energy independence is a visionary society project that will draw the way for the future for Quebec's prosperity. It's up to us to choose ... Allier Sustainable Development and Collective Enrichment!
