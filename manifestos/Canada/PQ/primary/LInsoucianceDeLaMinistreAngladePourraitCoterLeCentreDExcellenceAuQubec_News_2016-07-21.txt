Quebec, July 21, 2016 -The member for Sanguinet and spokesperson for the Québécois parties, Alain Therrien, doubt that the center of excellence of the C Series route. According to him, the management of this file by Dominique Anglade and Jacques Daoust jeopardizes the very existence of the future center. 
"It was with astonishment that we learned that Minister Anglade approves Air Canada's decision to maintain the drivers of his C Series aircraft in the United States. Yet last February, Air Canada was committed to meeting Quebec. Each new information tells us, however, that the guarantees obtained by the Government, in exchange for the investment of US $ 1 billion in Bombardier and the abandonment of remedies for workers in Aveos, are insignificant, "said the member. Sanguinet. 
"Already, in the absence of the membership of several Bombardier customers at the Center of Excellence, many experts doubt that this project is realized. It should also be remembered that abandoning Aveos, Air Canada closed a center that was serving the engines. Why does the government then allow the company to escape this constraint with the future center of excellence? The fact that engines have not been included in the agreement with Air Canada proves that it was poorly crazy. Once again, the minister confirms his amateurism by rejoicing an important gap of his own agreement that will allow Air Canada to have the engines of his devices outside Quebec as it is the case. One of the most profitable activities, "concluded Alain Therrien.
