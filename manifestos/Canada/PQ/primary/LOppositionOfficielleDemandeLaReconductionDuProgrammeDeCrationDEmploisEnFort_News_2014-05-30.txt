Québec- The hon. Member for Bonaventure and Forest Opposition Spokesperson, Sylvain Roy, asks the Government to renew the Forest job creation program (PCEF). 
"The $ 15 Million Envelope of the PCEF has created 845 forest management jobs during the year 2012-2013, including the majority in Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspé-Îles-de-la-Madeleine Regions that have been hard hit by the forest crisis, "said Sylvain Roy. 
"This program is essential for the survival of many communities where, often, one of the only employers is a forest group or a cooperative. This program funds, in some cases, more than 50% of turnover, "added the hon. Member for Bonaventure. 
Remember that the Quebec party government has defended forestry workers and the future of the sector by holding you national of the Quebec forest, unprecedented gathering of actors in the forest world. He also presented Lacharte du Boisafin to promote the use of this material in the construction industry. 
"The Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, Laurent Lessard, must stand in front of liberal austerity and unlock the funds necessary for the renewal of the CEP. Forest cooperatives need this funding to create the jobs in the regional workers, "concluded Sylvain Roy.
