Quebec, on November 9, 2016 - In a motion from Wednesday, the official opposition denounces the disparity with which the federal government deals with the provinces, particularly Quebec, when it takes into account the considerable advantage that it has consented to Newfoundland? And? Labrador, through a loan guarantee that is now $ 9.2 billion for its Hydroelectric project from Muskrat Falls. 
This loan guarantee, which covers a period of 35 to 40 years, will represent an economy of nearly $ 1.5 billion for the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, an amount of $ 2750 per capita. "If the federal government guaranteed the borrowings of Hydro-Québec, as it does for the Muskrat Falls project, the long-term borrowing rates of the Crown corporation would be diminished, which would represent a saving of 13, 5 G $ 30, "commented on the leader of the official opposition, Jean-François Lisée. 
By the filing of this motion, the official opposition attempts to obtain the support of the members of the National Assembly to claim the federal government the equivalent of the direct and indirect benefits granted to Newfoundland? And Labrador for its investments oil tankers, including the exclusion of its offshore income in the calculation of its equalization. 
"The Quebec Minister responsible for Canadian relations, Jean-Marc Fournier, calls for a" win-win "agreement with the federal government, to restore equity to Quebec and without penalizing Newfoundland, in the Muskrat Falls file. Clearly, Mr. Fournier claims a similar financial advantage for Quebec and we offer him all our support. The motion we present makes it possible to embody the recovery of this fairness, "said Nicolas Marceau, spokesperson for Quebec's Quebec Party. Canada. 
Recall also that the federal government still refuses to give us $ 463 million for the ice crisis that occurred almost twenty years ago in 1998.
