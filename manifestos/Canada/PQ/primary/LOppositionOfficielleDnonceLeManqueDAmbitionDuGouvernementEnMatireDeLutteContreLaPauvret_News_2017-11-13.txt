Quebec, November 13, 2017 -The official opposition spokesperson for employment, social solidarity and poverty fight, Harold Lebel, strongly criticizes certain recommendations of the report revealed today by the Committee. experts on the guaranteed minimum income. 
IN SHORT 
"It must be said: the measure of the consumption basket, it is in a way the famous" poverty threshold ". However, having only 55% of the MPC, as recommended by the report, it is getting out of the extreme misery, but remain poor. Currently, social assistance assures anyone 52% of the MPC. An increase of 3% is only $ 40 more per month. The government must do better and ensure that all Quebeckers have access to decent income, which will actually take out poverty, "claimed Harold Lebel. 
"It looks like the government gave the Committee a mandate that would provide it with the recommendations it needed. As the mandate is not specifically focused on improving income support - it was more oriented towards the simplification of the regime and incentive to work -, the Committee could hardly recommend the substantial bonus of the benefits of aid. . Does the government really look for a way to help the most vulnerable, or rather to justify the indefensible employment objective program, introduced this summer? The spokesman wondered. 
"Quebec currently has 800,000 people in extreme poverty. If the government applies the report's recommendations in its next Poverty Reduction Plan, only 100,000 will be able to leave. A rich state like Quebec can not tolerate this state of affairs! I ask the Minister Fran√ßois Blais to show courage and not to settle for that. To achieve results that will actually help our fellow citizens and our fellow citizens, of the ambition and a strong plan are needed, "he concluded.
