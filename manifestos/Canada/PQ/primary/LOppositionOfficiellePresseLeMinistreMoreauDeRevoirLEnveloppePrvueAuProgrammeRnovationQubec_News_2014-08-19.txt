Quebec- The member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and sentence of the official in-house opposition, Carole Poirier, welcomes the decision of the City of Montreal to honor his commitments in granting grants to Access to the property. Of the same breath, in a letter sent to the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the Territory, Pierre Moreau, she presses the pitch and review the budget envelope planned for the Rénovation Québec (PRQ) program of the Quebec Housing Corporation. 
"The buyers whose act was noted before the 14th of July, who had not yet tabled their claim for reimbursement to the City of Montreal, were unfairly deprived of a sum they had budgeted. The City of Montreal has made the right decision: to compensate these citizens and honor its portion of the payment of the grant. The minister must review his and do the same, "the spokesman said. 
It should be remembered that in its June 2014 budget, the Liberal government has made the wrong decision to stop contributing to the PRQ, and it retroactively at the beginning of the current budget year. The PRQ, in force since 2002, allowed to subsidize municipalities so that they develop important access to ownership and home renovation assistance programs, funded 50% by the Government and 50% by towns. Montreal, like several other cities, benefited from the PRQ, which had allowed it to set up six programs, including the one to facilitate access to the property. 
"This measure benefited mainly to families; It is not fair that they have to pay for a government decision whose details were suddenly communicated to cities, allowing them to adjust their budgets, "concluded the member.
