Joliette- "Contrary to what he said, the French language is not an issue for François Legault". This is what the member for Drummond and spokesman of the official opposition in terms of language, Yves-François Blanchet, stating that the Calciste Chef, François Legault, did not believe it good to name a door -PAROLE in French language in its ghost cabinet revealed today. 
"It's still revealing. After hunting his attachment to the French language, François Legault splees his blow at the first opportunity. The observation is clear: it does not share the interest and concern of the vast majority of Quebeckers for the French language. By not designating any specific linguistic questions, François Legault makes like Jean Charest and places the issue of the language far away in his priorities, "said Yves-François Blanchet. 
According to the member for Drummond, this "forgetting" in a file so neuralgic is an example of improvisation that led to the meager political program of the Future Québec Coalition. "It's not surprising. Unlike all recognized parties, the CAQ makes the economy of the exercise of reflection and democracy for the development of a program by hundreds or thousands of activists. There are big holes in this party subjected to the authority of a single self-proclaimed Messiah. After the environment and agriculture, two stakes absent from the Cavoist program, today is the language that the CAQ allows themselves to neglect, "he concluded.
