Quebec, October 24, 2014 -The member for Bourget and the official opposition on immigration, Maka Kotto, and the member for Gaspé and spokesperson for the development of the regions, Gaétan Lelièvre denounce the That the Liberal government continue its centralization work. It has indeed announced the closure of the regional directorates of the Ministry of Immigration, Diversity and Inclusion (noon) located in Quebec City, Trois-Rivières, Gatineau and Sherbrooke. 
"How to ensure optimal integration of immigrants in our regions when cutting the resources that are devoted to it? This real dismantling breaks the link between the ministry, communities and organizations. We can not claim that there will be no impacts on services. The integration of newcomers to Quebec City, Trois-Rivières, Sherbrooke and Gatineau is just as essential as it is in Montreal, "said Maka Kotto. 
The member for Gaspé indicates that the regions are once again losing the tools and resources needed for their development. This decline in local services is in addition to many other examples of liberal cuts affecting the regions of Quebec. 
In addition, what will happen to the amounts arising from regional immigration agreements? Resources were granted to regional organizations, including Crés, CLDs and MRCs. At the rate of the liberal cuts go, the Parti Québécois wonders if they will remain organizations to receive these sums. 
"The Liberals continue in the same logic; They claim to know better than people in the field what to do. They are built an ivory tower, from which citizens are excluded. Centralization and control of the state, operations carried out under the mask of austerity, hurt the development of the regions, not only at the economic level, but also on the social level. This loss of expertise of the public service, a reality that affects several areas, certainly will not help the integration of newcomers into our regions, "added Gaétan Lelièvre.
