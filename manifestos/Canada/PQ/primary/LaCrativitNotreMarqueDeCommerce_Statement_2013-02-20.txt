The vision of the future of my government for the Quebec economy is based not only on our natural resources, but also and especially on an inexhaustible resource: Quebeckers themselves! Creativity, meaning of innovation, taste for excellence: it is by building these forces that Quebec may stand out in the world. 
We notice more and more, all over the planet: Quebec is associated with creativity. The Cirque du Soleil, Our Great Festivals, Our Backyard Dance Troops, Our Music Scene, Our Large Aerospace Companies, Moment Factory, Sid Lee, Beyond The Rack and the Next Arrival of Framestore: This creativity, we want Make the signature of Quebec in the world. 
Let's not be afraid of having ambition. Mine is to put in place the conditions that will allow Quebec to become one of the most prosperous places in the Americas. We managed to make Quebec, especially Montreal, one of the world's aerospace industry, life and multimedia industry. And we intend to launch a large project, a project that will mobilize all Quebec for many years: the electrification of our transport. What I want is that the others trying to catch up with Quebec, not otherwise. We are able. 
We want people to everywhere automatically associate Quebec with innovation, to the invention, to modernity! It is the keystone of a truly lasting prosperity for Quebec.
