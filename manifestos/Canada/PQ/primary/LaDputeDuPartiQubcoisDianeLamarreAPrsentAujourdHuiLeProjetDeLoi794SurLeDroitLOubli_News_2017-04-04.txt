IN SHORT 
The Québécois party today presented a bill related to cancer survivors. 
"We believe in the right to oblivion. We believe that insurers must be prohibited from imposing a surcharge or to refuse an individual insurance contract to a person who has survived a cancer, after a specific time. For survivors of certain current types of cancer, the deadline for access to the right to oblivion could vary between 1 and 10 years after the end of the treatments, depending on the scientific data. The Parti Québécois wants to ensure that people are no longer discriminated against when the risk of cancer recurrence are zero or extremely low, "said Diane Lamarre. 
"Nearly one in two Quebeckers will have a form of cancer during his life. Fortunately, more than 60% will survive it beyond 5 years. To prevent these people from being doubly victims of this terrible disease, by preventing this form of discrimination against them, is the least of things. We hope that the Minister of Health will be sensitive to this issue and that he will support the bill, "concluded the spokesperson. 
In the appendix, you will find the explanatory notes on Bill 794.
