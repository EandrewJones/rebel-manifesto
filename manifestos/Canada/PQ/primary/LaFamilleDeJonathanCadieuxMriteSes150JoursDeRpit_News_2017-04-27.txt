Quebec, on April 27, 2017- Dave Turcotte, spokesman for the Quebec's social services and youth protection, has filed this morning a petition of 6725 names asking the Quebec government to restore the services offered to the family Cadieux so that she can keep Jonathan, a child with heavy deficiencies at home. More specifically, the petitioners claim that the family is up to the 150 days a year of specialized respite services that it had previously benefited, and reimbursed for its essence. 
IN SHORT 
"Until November 2016, Jonathan's parents kept their son at home; Considering the heaviness of its care, they were entitled to 150 days a year of specialized respite services offered by the southwestern rehabilitation services and the reinforcement. However, after a reorganization, the number of respite days increased to 48, at a cost of $ 30 a day, like other families of children with disabilities. It is far from sufficient, especially if we consider the significant costs that this situation causes, parents who have decided to let their jobs, "revealed Dave Turcotte. 
Despite all their efforts, they still had to be resolved to place Jonathan in an institution. "His disability is too heavy, it's too much to ask that family. But on the other hand, a life in institution is not the solution; Jonathan could wither, deprived of the presence, care and love of his parents. We must support the Cadieux family so that Jonathan can receive the help he needs to stay at home, "prosecuted the spokesman. 
The example of Jonathan is terribly sad and, unfortunately, it is not unique. "The cutting cuts by minister Ga√©tan Barrette in health and social services do not hurt families and the poorest everywhere in Quebec. On behalf of the dignity of people, the government must restore the services offered to the Cadieux family; She deserves her 150 days of respite a year, "concluded Dave Turcotte.
