Quebec- Mrs. Agn√®s Maltais, Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women is pleased to launch the third edition of the Week of Solidarity, which takes place this year from 14 to 20 October. 
On this occasion, the Minister invites all partners and agencies to join local and regional poverty initiatives, including those offered by elected regional conferences. 
"I take this opportunity to thank those who are involved all year round in this daily comb. I am proud that this thematic week can be used to mobilize our strength to help people who are in need. We must never abdicate in front of poverty, but look in front and make it back. We must build for all and all a Quebec always just ", reminds the minister. 
It should be noted that this week revolves around the International Journey for the Elimination of Poverty, which takes place every year on October 17th around the world. 
"The mobilization decreases individual forces and makes everyone's efforts more efficient," concludes Maltese minister.
