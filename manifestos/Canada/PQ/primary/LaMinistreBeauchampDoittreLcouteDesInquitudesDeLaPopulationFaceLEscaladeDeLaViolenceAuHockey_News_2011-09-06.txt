Québec -The MP for Labelle and official opposition spokesperson for leisure and sports, Sylvain Pagé, challenges Minister Line Beauchamp to seriously question the relevance of hockey fights. 
"It is the responsibility of Minister Beauchamp to see our young people practicing our national sport in a safe environment where violence is prohibited. With the recent deaths of three fighters in the National Hockey League, the increase in wounds and braincoms, it is the entire hockey community from here and elsewhere that must show the example and take the necessary measures, "said Sylvain Pagé. 
"You have to send a clear message. As a member of Parliament, but especially as a parent, I'm worried about the health of young people who practice this sport. There are several ways of solutions that go through more severe regulations, by modifications to equipment, but especially, by a profound change in culture in this sport. The minister responsible for the leisure and sports must mark the step and take the bull by the horns! , Added Sylvain Pagé. 
"During my participation in the Québec hockey summit that took place in Montreal at the end of August, I heard several Quebec speakers fueling the debate on this delicate question. The effects of hockey violence are devastating as much for the health of players as well as hockey as a whole. The population expects elected officials to this effect, "concluded the member for Labelle.
