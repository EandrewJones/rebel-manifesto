Quebec- The member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and sentence of the official opposition in terms of women's condition, Carole Poirier, request explanations to the Minister of the Family, Francine Charbonneau, who would have completely ignored a request from the Board of Staff Regulations of the woman (CSF) to make a differentiated gender analysis of the impact of the government's ideological decision to modulate child care rates on the presence of women in the labor market. 
"On October 6th, the CSF invited the government to proceed with this differentiated analysis. Why did the minister refuse to respond to this suggestion? Why mentioned last Friday that she had not had the reflex to ask her opinion to the CSF and that it was an error? Is it because she did not analyze it now that the family tax is only a proposal? Or the minister lied, or knowingly ignored the letter of the CSF and chose not to perform any gender differentiated analysis. It is a serious misconduct for which it owes explanations to Quebecers, "said Carole Poirier. 
As last Friday his colleague member for Taschereau and the official opposition 's leader, Agn√®s Maltese, the member formally requests the Minister to proceed with a gender differentiated analysis, which, to date,; has not been done yet. 
"In Quebec, we decided to introduce a system that gives women's choice, allowing them to return to the labor market. The modulation of the rates makes us go back. Like the CSF, we believe in the benefits of the child care network as to the presence of women in the labor market and family-working-study conciliation, "concluded Carole Poirier.
