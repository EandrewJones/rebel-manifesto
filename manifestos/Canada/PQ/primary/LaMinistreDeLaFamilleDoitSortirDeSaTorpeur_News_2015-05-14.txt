Quebec- The member for Terrebonne and official opposition on the family, Mathieu Traversy, is surprised to hear that the childcare service where sexual assault on a 4-year-old girl remains open while waiting for investigation procedures. The Minister of the Family, Francine Charbonneau, "said May 12, that the guard service was going to close. 
"The Coordinating Office has not closed the family custody service, while an internal investigation is in place. Why? The minister must give answers to the many questions; Transparency is setting. This is the trust of the parents towards the guard services of Quebec. We have a wonderful network of child care, and parents must be able to leave their child safely. The rules and framework must be reviewed with the network and family child care managers, to better support them, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
"At present, the minister makes parents pay more by imposing the family tax, delays the development of the places, cuts the custody budgets and improves neither quality nor accessibility nor security. It must immediately revoke the license of this daycare and relocate children, the time that the internal investigation follows its course and that light is made on the circumstances of this dramatic event, "concluded Mathieu Traversy.
