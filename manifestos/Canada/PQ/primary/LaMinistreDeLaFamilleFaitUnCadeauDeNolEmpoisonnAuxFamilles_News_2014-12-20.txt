Quebec- The member for Terrebonne and the official opposition spokesman, Mathieu Traversy, denounces the despiring attitude of the Minister of the Family, Francine Charbonneau, who announced this afternoon, just before the Christmas holidays, changes to the financing of CPE places creation projects. Changes, in effect today, will require CEPs to provide 50% of the financing of capital fees. 
"By demanding such a contribution, the minister puts the ax in the network and she knows it very well. No place in CPE can be created. This is the final touch, in 2014, liberal attacks against families. Parents waiting for a place and children from disadvantaged circles are once again targeted by the minister. As Christmas approach is the worst gift she could do to parents and children of Quebec, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
"As one of his liberal predecessors, Tony Tomassi, the Minister of the Family has obvious contempt for the CPE network. The changes made today aim directly, for the benefit of non-subsidized private daycares. That the minister cease to lie to families by saying that places continue to be created in the network, whereas it knows that CPE will no longer be able to do so. Since his arrival, she has only demonstrated, day after day, that families are the last of his worries. She must give in her place, "concluded Mathieu Traversy.
