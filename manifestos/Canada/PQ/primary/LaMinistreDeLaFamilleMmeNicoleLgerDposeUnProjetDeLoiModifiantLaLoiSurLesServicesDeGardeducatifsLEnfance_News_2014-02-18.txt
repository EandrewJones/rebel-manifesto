Québec- The Minister of the Family, Ms. Nicole Léger, today presented the National Assembly An Act to amend the Child Care Services Act. The proposed legislative changes follow the judgment pronounced by the Court of Appeal in September 2013, concerning the number of daycare licenses and places whose childcare services are subsidized that a person or related persons may hold. 
"The Ministry of the Family continues its efforts and takes the necessary means to limit the concentration of child care while giving the decision of the Court of Appeal. With this bill, we maintain the goal of not going beyond the limits of license / 300 places, "said Minister Nicole Léger. 
The proposed legislative changes will make it possible to circumscribe the notion of related person by limiting certain situations where a natural person or a legal person would be considered linked with another person for the purposes of the law. Indeed, the bill provides that a related person who establishes the absence of an economic link, is not bound within the meaning of Articles 93.1 and 93.2 of the Act. Also, there may be economic ties similar to those encountered in a family between people who are not related; The legislative changes also cover these situations. The bill also provides for the possibility for the Ministry of the Family to require any document or intelligence necessary to verify whether people are economically related. 
The provisions of subparagraph 2 (a) of Article 3 of the Child Educational Care Services Act, as currently written, remain in force until September 11, 2014, until expiration the one-year suspension of the Court of Appeal's decision, or until the coming into force of the new proposed provisions, if it occurs before that date. When the new provisions of the law will come into force, the Ministry of Family will inform the subsidized child care network.
