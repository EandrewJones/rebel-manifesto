Quebec- The Minister of the Family, Ms. Nicole LÃ©ger, announces the holding of a targeted project for the purpose of optimizing reduced educational custody services offered in early childhood centers (CPE) and daycare . 
This targeted call for projects is part of the General Project Call announced last February by the Minister of the Family for the creation of 15,000 additional reduced contribution places to complete the network of educational custody services to childhood. Thus, from these 15,000 places, a maximum of 1,000 places will be reserved for this targeted project call. These places will be available more quickly as early as fall 2013. 
"As the call for projects launched today, the agreements concluded with CPEs bring fruit. By enabling the creation of new places in reduced contribution services, these agreements will also be beneficial for many families across Quebec, "said the Minister of Family. 
Under this targeted project call, CPEs and daycares will be able to complement existing group of children to meet Quebec's educational child care regulations. 
Recall that the Ministry of the Family recently concluded agreements with the Quebec Association of Early Childhood Centers of Quebec (AQCPE) and the Quebec Council for Childcare Educational Services (CQSgee), with respect to redevelopment measures budget planned for the 2013-2014 fiscal year. Under these agreements, in addition to certain budget recovery arrangements, the Department agreed with these organizations to set up specific ways to ensure their sustainability and the optimization of their funding. 
Licensees will be invited in the coming days to apply to the Ministry of Family. After their analysis by the regional advisory committees and their recommendations, the Department will make public the projects selected in September 2013.
