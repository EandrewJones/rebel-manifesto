Quebec- The Minister of Natural Resources of Quebec, Mrs. Martine Ouellet, introduced this morning a law on minefin law to provide Quebec with modern mining legislation. This adjusted bill ensures the development of the Quebec mining industry in respect of the environment. 
"We have heard the comments of the citizens and the various actors of the community, as well as those of the opposition members, and we have managed to reach a balance. If it is adopted diligently by the National Assembly, this balanced bill will end a four-year approach and will collectively allow us to take up the next challenges we face, "said Martine Ouellet. 
Among others, the bill: 
"The balance is there. The substance is there. The consensus is there. Quebeckers are ripe for a new mines law. It is now time for Parliament to act and open a new era for responsible, dynamic and balanced mining development in Quebec, "concluded the Minister of Natural Resources.
