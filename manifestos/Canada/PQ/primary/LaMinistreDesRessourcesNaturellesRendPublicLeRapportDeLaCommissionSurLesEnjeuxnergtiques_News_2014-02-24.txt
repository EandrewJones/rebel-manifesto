Montréal- The Minister of Natural Resources, Mrs. Martine Ouellet, makes public the report of the two co-chairs of the Commission on the energy issues of Quebec: the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to the energy independence of Quebec, Mr. Normand Mousseau as well as Mr. Roger Lanoue. 
"The government led nearly 50 public consultations throughout Quebec to meet citizens. It is nearly 300 speakers who came to present their memory and more than 460 submissions were sent to the Commission. This report is a major democratic exercise for the future of Quebec, mainly for the energy sector. It is deplorable that this important report was poured into the media, "said Martine Ouellet. 
The Commission's Report on Energy Issues is accessible to the following address: ConsultationEnergie.gouv.qc.ca. This report is divided into four themes: 
A series of public consultations were conducted throughout Quebec from September 4 to October 11, 2013. Mr. Normand Mousseau, Professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Montreal, as well as Mr. Roger Lanoue, who worked for more than 20 years at Hydro Québec as Vice-President for Strategic Planning and Business Development, co-chair this commission. 
"The report's recommendations will serve as inputs for the preparation of Quebec's new energy policy, which should be filed in the coming months," the minister concluded.
