Québec - It is with sadness and anxiety that we learned yesterday that eccentris cinema, struggling with important financial difficulties, must suspend its activities. The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in the field of culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, asks the Minister of Culture, Hélène David, to find solutions that will ensure the survival of the institution. 
"Excentris, specializing in author's cinema, is an exceptional window for Quebec movies and filmmakers. It also facilitates the diffusion of independent films from here and elsewhere. Its final closure would be a huge loss for the Quebec cultural environment, "said the member for Joliette. 
Véronique Hivon emphasizes the paradox of the current situation. "Excentris closes its doors, while distributors say halls and repertoire cinema or emerging hard to find places of mailing," she said. 
"On behalf of the Cinephiles of Quebec, the radiation of the seventh art and not to mention the employees of the Excentris, for whom we have a particular thought, we ask Minister Hélène David to find concrete solutions that can ensure the survival of the Establishment ", concluded Véronique Hivon.
