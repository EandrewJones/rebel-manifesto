Quebec- The member for Bertrand and official opposition spokesperson for Tourism, Claude Cousineau, requires the Minister of Tourism, Dominique Vien, that she renounces imposing the tax on hosting for camping. 
"True to the liberal tradition, Philippe Couillard has promised tax cuts in the election campaign, but it governs them by increasing them. It looks like that, getting up in the morning, government members always have a new tax idea to impose on Quebecers. Campers, mostly people here, it's not an international clientele; The government has to give up the idea of taxing them, "Claude Cousineau said. 
The member considers that when the Liberal government talks about taxes, it must always be wary. For example, during the study of budget appropriations, Minister Vien has made it clear that the accommodation tax did not belong to the Regional Tourism Associations (ATR), and that his government would "need to disengage sums of money ". What do these sibylline remarks mean? Claude Cousineau therefore asks the minister to reiterate his confidence in the ATR and commit to seeking solutions other than the standardization of the accommodation tax or a tax on the campsite. 
Not the standardization of the accommodation tax 
"Even the former Liberal Minister Raymond Bachand, who himself has increased taxes, tariffs and taxes of $ 6 billion, warned the government against the centralization of the accommodation tax, considering that it would penalize greatly the ATR. What does the minister mean? It is essential that regions, already undermined by liberal austerity policies, can maintain the management of the accommodation tax and the freedom to decide how to reinvest it, depending on their own characteristics, " concluded the member for Bertrand.
