Health and Social Services of Quebec, CORPORATION welcome a child and sun of nations. 
"It's a great news for Haitian children. These can be welcomed permanently by Quebec parents with whom they can grow and flourish. Let us mention that adoption procedures have gradually resumed in the spring of 2013, particularly in order to experiment with the new Haitian adoption procedures. I am pleased to announce today the complete recovery of activities, "said Mrs Hivon. 
Remember that Quebec had suspended its adoption procedures with Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, due to certain uncertainties as to the control of the adoption process in this country. Quebec then encouraged the creation of a host country coalition, the Montreal group, including Canada, France, the United States and Germany, and whose goal is to support Haiti in the Establishment of an adequate legislative and administrative framework. 
"This is a good example of international collaboration. This demonstrates that we all commit to respect for the fundamental rights of children and to ensure that the adoption process is taking place in their first interest. I would also like to salute the work done by the Haitian authorities to reform international adoption as well as their collaboration with the coalition of the main host countries of Haiti children, "said Minister Hivon.
