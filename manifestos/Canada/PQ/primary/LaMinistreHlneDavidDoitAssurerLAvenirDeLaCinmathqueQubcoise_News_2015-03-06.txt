Quebec- While voices in the middle of cinema rises against a possible merger of the Quebec Cinémathèque with National Library and Archives of Quebec, the member for Joliette and sentence of the official opposition in the field of culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, asks Minister Hélène David to be clear and to ensure the future of the Cinémathèque, a real jewel of our cultural heritage. 
"In the episode of the regional conservatories, the minister's closing plans denoted a serious lack of vision and a large part of improvisation. We now seem to want to play in the same film, this time with the Cinémathèque, an important institution for the safeguarding and valorization of our audiovisual heritage. Unfortunately, she is currently at risk. Several actors in this community, however, are concerned with the possible merger of two institutions to very different missions, fearing that the Cinémathèque is downright engulfed in the operation, "said Véronique Hivon. 
"Minister Hélène David must now put an end to uncertainty and be clear in his intentions. Will she force the merger? What would be the patterns? For more than 50 years, the Cinémathèque has been building its expertise; She is today an internationally recognized institution. I invite the Minister to dialogue and collaboration; It must not impose an unfounded and dangerous decision for maintaining the Cinémathèque's excellence, "concluded the member for Joliette.
