Quebec- The member for Joliette and spokesman for the official opposition in the field of culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, asked Minister Hélène David this morning to reassure the cultural environment for the idea that circulates persistently the effect of the closure of the conservatories in the region. The minister not only refused to dismiss this scenario, but it has increased the level of concern by invoking the legal existence "of a single conservatory" with simple "regional poles", seeming to consider them as institutions. second order. 
"The conservatories are institutions that, in addition to training high-level artists, prove true catalysts for cultural life in the region. By allowing music professionals to settle and improve outside Montreal and Quebec City, the Communities of Bas-Saint-Laurent, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, of the Outaouais, Mauricie and Abitibi-Témiscamingue. All these regions benefit widely from the impact and radiation of the conservatories, "said Véronique Hivon. 
Since the birth of the first conservatory, in 1942, these institutions have formed hundreds of professional artists who are now working as members of the region orchestras, but also as teachers and cultural facilitators. These professionals, as well as their students, are also at the heart of cultural projects and the programming of the entertainment rooms that showcase culture in their region and throughout Quebec. 
"After cutting tax credits for cultural production, poorly undermined and devalued the importance of reading and book, the Liberal government knowingly suggests doubt about the retention of the conservatories. What does the Minister of Culture and Communications await to fully assume his role and confirm the importance of the recruitment and teaching mission of the conservatories? What does she expect to fight to protect the cultural development of Quebec? ", Concluded the member for Joliette.
