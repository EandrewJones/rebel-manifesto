Qu√©bec- The Minister of Natural Resources, Martine Ouellet, is proud to announce the allocation of two mining leases to the Xstrata mining company for its Bracemac-McLeod project, whose zinc and copper extraction activities will begin at the mid-May, in the Matagami area. 
"The opening of this mine means at the bottom word 250 direct jobs over a period of at least four years. The opening of the Mine Bracemac-McLeod is a great news for a city of 2,000 inhabitants like Matagami, "said Martine Ouellet. The opening of the mine will, among other things, allow the transfer of the expertise of Perseverance Mine employees, another property of Xstrata in the region, whose exploitation draws to an end. 
"This news is very important for the city of Matagami, its workers and our region. This demonstrates our government's willingness to focus on Nordic development, "said Luc Ferland, a member of Parliament for Ungava and Nordic Affairs Deputy. 
The operation of the zinc and copper of the Bracemac-McLod deposits also makes it possible to ensure the supply of the Matagami plant, which produces a concentrate for each of the metals. The zinc concentrate will subsequently be transformed to the Cezinc factory in Valleyfield, and that of copper will be transformed into the Horne Foundry of Rouyn-Noranda and the CCR refinery of Montreal, which allows the maintenance of more than 1 800 Jobs. 
The initial investment of Xstrata amounted to $ 160 million to $ 70 million to $ 75 million a year of operation. 
"Here we have a good example of the economic benefits that can be generated by the mining industry when the transformation in Quebec is favored. That's exactly the kind of structuring economic project for Quebec, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
