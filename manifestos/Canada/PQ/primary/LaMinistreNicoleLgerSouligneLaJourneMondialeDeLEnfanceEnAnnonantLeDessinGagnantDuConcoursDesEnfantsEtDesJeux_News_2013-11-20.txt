"All children need to play, because it is by playing that the little ones develop, learn and awake their curiosity. The Children's Drawing Contest and Games aims to remember that the game is a fundamental right during early childhood. That's why it's important to value it on a daily basis and give young children time to live a variety of game experiences, "said Minister Nicole Léger. 
Recall that the World Children's Day, celebrated on November 20, is the anniversary date of the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, in 1959, and the signature, in 1989, of the International Convention on Rights of the child by 191 countries. As a signatory to the Convention, Quebec is committed to ensuring the overall well-being of children and the respect of their rights in all plans.
