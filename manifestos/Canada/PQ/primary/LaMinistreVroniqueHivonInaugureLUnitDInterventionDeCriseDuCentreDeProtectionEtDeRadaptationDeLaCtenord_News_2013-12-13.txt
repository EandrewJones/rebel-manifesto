Sept-Îles - Minister Delegate to Social Services and the Protection of Youth, Ms. Véronique Hivon, once inaugurated the new Crisis Intervention Unit of the Côte-Nord (CPRCN) Center for the Protection and Rehabilitation Center . For the occasion, the minister was accompanied by the member for Duplessis, Ms. Lorraine Richard. 
This new crisis intervention unit, annexed to the rehabilitation center, will welcome young people in difficulty aged 6 to 18 years. They will now have access to a place where they can temporarily withdraw during crisis situations. This project is the result of a collaboration initiated by the CNRCN to provide an additional tool for all stakeholders working with young people and families. 
"I welcome the efforts of the CNRCN team to always better support young people in difficulty and their families, with the desire to provide them with services adapted to their needs and their particular situations. This new unit will allow young people who often have to deal with larger challenges than a quiet location to retire when they go through a difficult situation. They will now be able to receive the required management more quickly, while remaining closer to their home, "said Mrs Hivon. 
"I am delighted for these young people who, through the consultation of the people of the community, will benefit from greater security and will be better supported in the difficult events they cross. They will no longer have to move outside their environment to receive the precious help they need, it's a great news for young seventhogs and their families who live difficulties, "added the member to Duplessis. 
Built at the total cost of $ 2,313,212, this new unit, which will open at the beginning of 2014, will have a recurring annual operating budget of $ 738,716 from the Health and Social Services Agency of North Shore and CPRCN.
