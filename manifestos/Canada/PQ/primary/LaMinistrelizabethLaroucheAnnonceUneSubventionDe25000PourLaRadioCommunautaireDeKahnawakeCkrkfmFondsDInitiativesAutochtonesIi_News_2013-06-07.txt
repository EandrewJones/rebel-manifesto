Qu√©bec - Minister Delegate to Aboriginal Affairs, Ms. Elizabeth Larouche, announces the grant of a grant of $ 26,522 to CKRK-FM, a non-profit community organization. 
"As a preferred mode of communication, this radio station has been part of the Mohawk Nation's daily life for more than 30 years. She became, in a way, an institution. Its vocation, both cultural and informative, makes it essential service to the population, and the auditors are particularly attached, "said the minister. 
This grant will be used primarily for the purchase of technical equipment, made necessary since the organization had to leave its old premises because of their obsolescence, to move in 2011 in a new building. This building also houses a Mohawks language and culture training center. This new workspace is now safe and healthy for employees. 
The financial assistance to Kahnawake's CKRK-FM Radio Station comes from the Aboriginal Aboriginal Initiative Fund II (SAA), Community Infrastructure component. The objective of this fund is to support projects that can have significant benefits on Quebec's Aboriginal Nations Economic, Social or Community Development.
