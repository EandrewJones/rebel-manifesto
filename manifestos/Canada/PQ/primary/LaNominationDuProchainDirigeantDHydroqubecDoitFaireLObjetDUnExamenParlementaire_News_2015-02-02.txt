Quebec, on January 30, 2015 - Following the announcement of the next departure from Thierry Vandal, CEO of Hydro-Québec, the member for Marie-Victorin and spokesperson for the official energy opposition, Bernard Drainville, proposes that the appointment of the next leader of the state society is the subject of a parliamentary review. 
"When the government has identified a candidate, the latter should be heard by a parliamentary committee to support his candidacy and answer the questions of the elected officials, before the adoption of the Government Appointment Decree.. The CEO of Hydro-Québec must continue to take up the government and to act consistent with its main orientations. Choices such as the release of nuclear power or electrification of transport must remain the prerogative of the Council of Ministers. On the other hand, the appointment process needs to be improved. The Government must be prepared to submit to the review of parliamentarians the qualifications and powers of the applicant's proponent, and agree to take into consideration the Commission's report before the appointment is confirmed, "said Bernard Drainville. 
The member also emphasized the long service states of Thierry Vandal and wished him good success for the rest of his career.
