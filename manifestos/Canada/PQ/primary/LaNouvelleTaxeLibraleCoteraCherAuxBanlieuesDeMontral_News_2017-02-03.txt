Quebec, February 3, 2017- The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on transport, Alain Therrien, denounces the new tax that the Liberal government will impose on the suburbs of Montreal, without any form of transparency. 
"We had the confirmation this morning that the Cuteillard government hid a new tax for the suburbs in the Regional Metropolitan Transport Authority Act, ARTM. Indeed, only for the reform of the structure, the suburbs will have to pay an additional $ 32 million, which will be added to the already planned increase in their contributions, which also refers to several million dollars, " Illustrated Alain Therrien. 
"Thus, Longueuil, Laval and the other suburbs South and North will pay millions more, but will not benefit from any new transit services. Worse: to these spectacular increases, the costs of the annual grant should be added that municipalities will eventually have to pay for the metropolitan electricity grid; We are talking about an additional bill of about $ 200 million, while the government had promised that REM would not require any subsidy, "continued the speech. 
"Finally, creating ARTM, the Liberal government has refiled a multi-million dollar TVQ bill to municipalities. Ultimately, in 2020, it will be nearly $ 15 million. When will the Liberal government cease to charge municipalities the realization of its election promises, the cost of which continues to increase? Asked Alain Therrien.
