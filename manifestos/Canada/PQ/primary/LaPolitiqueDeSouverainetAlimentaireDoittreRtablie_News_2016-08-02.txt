Québec- The member for Berthier and spokesman for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, asks the Government to restore the policy of food sovereignty that the Quebecois party had developed. 
"Our berry producers, for example, have great difficulty in placing their products in Quebec supermarkets, as they often prefer products from outside. This problem, like others, is the direct result of the abandonment by the Liberal government of the food sovereignty policy that had been unveiled by the Government of the Parti Québécois, in 2013, "said André Villeneuve. 
The member for Berthier recalls that this policy affirmed the clear and unequivocal will to increase the share of Quebec products in our plates. "All actors in the agri-food environment were mobilized to achieve this goal. However, the arrival of the Liberal government quickly put a brake on these efforts, "he sorry. 
"Today, we see the negative effects of the abandonment of this policy on our producers. Without the support of the government, they find themselves unable to deal with international competition, which sells its surpluses in the Quebec market. In order to ensure the prosperity of our entire agricultural sector, it is therefore essential that the Quebec government will restore the policy of food sovereignty, and quickly, "concluded André Villeneuve.
