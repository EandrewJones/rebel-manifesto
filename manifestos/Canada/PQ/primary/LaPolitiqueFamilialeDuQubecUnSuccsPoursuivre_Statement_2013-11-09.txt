Quebec's family policy allows today to thousands of children to know a better start. But let's go back and remember almost 20 years ago. 
The face of the Quebec family had changed profoundly. The Government of the Quebecois Party of the time was to identify a major challenge: identify measures that would ensure equity by universal support for families and increased help to low-income families; facilitate the reconciliation of parenting and professional responsibilities; and promote children's development and equal opportunities. All this in a budgetary context that was then very strict. 
To get there, we took us audacity, determination and rigor. But, fortunately, my accomplice of the time, Nicole LÃ©ger, today Minister of the Family, and I were not alone. Family policy had become the project of a government or even a society. 
Thanks, in particular, to the reduced educational custody services set up in 1997, Quebec now advances Canada for women's employment rate. Our family policy is even considered one of the best in the world. 
But behind the statistics, there are thousands of lives that we have helped make better, like that of this young woman met this summer, who told me that she had had a child when she was very young. Thanks to our family policy, she has been able to offer her baby the best educational services. She could stay at school. Today, his child grows up, she has a house and she works. 
Testimonies like this inspire us and remind us how right we were to equip us with such a policy. 
Nearly 20 years later, it is clear that the reality of Quebec families continues to evolve. However, one thing remains: it is the will of our government to act for their well-being. 
For us, take care of our world, take care of our families and children, it's strengthening Quebec. A society that mobilizes, family organizations and the best-equipped early childhood networks, more parents and children happy in all our regions, that's it, a stronger Quebec.
