Gatineau - Québec Prime Minister Pauline Marois, was passing through the Gatineau Chamber of Commerce, with the Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Elders, Réjean Hébert, and the Minister of the Public safety and Minister responsible for the Outaouais region, Stéphane Bergeron. She announced that her government will contribute to the Canadian Francophonie Games, which will be held in Gatineau from 23 to 27 July 2014. 
"I am pleased to confirm that we support these games. It is a healthy competition that promotes the talent of youth and that reaffirms the Quebec identity at the same time in the large Francophone community. This allows young people to open their horizons, to surpass, deliver the best of themselves, both intellectually and physically. This is a good example of what our teens are capable of: of discipline, performance and, of course, friendship, "said Pauline Marois. 
The Canadian Francophonie Games are among the largest francophone youth gatherings in Canada. This is the sixth edition of the event, which brings together a thousand young people from 13 to 18 years from coast to coast. The evaluations will focus on their performances in the field of arts and sports, as well as on their talents as leaders. Government financial assistance will amount to $ 472,500.
