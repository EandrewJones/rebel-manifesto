Saint-Joachim- The Prime Minister of Quebec and MP for Charlevoix-Côte-de-Beaupré, Pauline Marois, today announced a $ 958,000 agreement agreement for the Grande Farm Restoration project, a classified heritage building under the Cultural Heritage Act. 
"I look forward to this happy denouement. The Grande Farm is a heritage interest for both historical and architectural value. In addition, this site contains fascinating archaeological wealth that tells us about our collective heritage. His role in the community is of great importance, and the government wishes to preserve this jewel of Côte-de-Beaupré which contributes to the Quebec identity, "said Marois Prime Minister. 
A technical audit was conducted in 2011 to determine the work to be performed. The agreement in principle will produce complementary technical studies to well supervise interventions and ensure that the realization of these will be in accordance with heritage catering practices. 
The coating of the masonry walls and roofing are part of large-scale maintenance interventions. Urgent work include the consolidation of the floors and consolidation structure of one of the walls. Other interventions will allow the restoration of the windows, the standards of the emergency staircase, the restoration of the gallery and the consolidation of the remains of the first church of Saint-Joachim, located on the location of the large farm. 
The great farm made way in 1979 at a center of interpretation. Indeed, the Initiation Center - the Grande Farm has the mission to introduce the population all the wealth of Quebec heritage. Restoration and standards work will allow the Center to continue its educational mission. 
"I want to emphasize the exceptional work of the heritage initiation center - the Great Farm, a museum institution that leads thousands of young people annually to discover Quebec heritage," concluded the Prime Minister.
