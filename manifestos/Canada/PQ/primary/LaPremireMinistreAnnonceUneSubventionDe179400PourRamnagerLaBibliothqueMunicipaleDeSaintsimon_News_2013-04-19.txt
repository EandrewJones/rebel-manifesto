Thus, the library will be able to exercise its mandate more effectively and respond even better to the expectations of citizens, "said Marois Prime Minister.

The total cost of the project is $ 397,078 and is divided as follows: $ 179,400 from the Ministry of Culture and Communications, under its Capital Assistance Program, and $ 217,678 are allocated by the municipality of Saint -Simeon.
