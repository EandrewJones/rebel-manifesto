Montreal - A few days of Christmas, Quebec's Premier, Pauline Marois, held to offer his best wishes to Quebecers and Quebeckers. 
"In this holiday season, let's take advantage of this well-deserved break to find those who are dear to us. That these precious moments are for all synonyms of festivities and shared happiness! 
Over the past year, Quebeckers have shown extraordinary solidarity when the Lac-Mégantic community has been experienced by a rail tragedy. I think we are numerous to have a thought for meganticoises and meganticois during this period of the year when sadness and mourning become at times heavier to wear. In the same way, let's be generous to our fellow citizens who face illness, poverty or exclusion. 
Over the past year, Quebeckers have all worked hard to improve their living conditions and those of their families. That's what our government is also dedicated to. For 2014, what I wish us collectively is to continue building a richer, more solidarity and proud Quebec, a strong Quebec of all its regions and united in its diversity. By then, I wish everyone a very merry Christmas and a happy new year! »
