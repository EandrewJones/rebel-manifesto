Edinburgh - Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, met today in Scottish Parliament Prime Minister Alex Salmond. 
The Prime Minister Marois was passing through Scotland after his global economic participation of Davos, Switzerland. The interview allowed the two heads of government to discuss the tightening of economic collaboration. 
At the end of their meeting, the first two ministers made this statement: 
"Quebec and Scotland both have modern and dynamic economies that are based on key sectors such as financial services, energy, life sciences and tourism. Our two governments also focus on the development of foreign trade and the attraction of foreign investment as levers of economic growth. » 
"Since Quebec and Scotland have given ambitious targets in the fight against climate change, the energy and environment sectors, in particular, appear most promising to strengthen our economic collaboration. Quebec aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2020, while Scotland wishes to reduce them by 80% by 2050, below the 1990 level. This is a opportunity to discuss our respective best practices in order to meet these commitments. Scotland also has recognized expertise in wind energy and tidal up, two sectors of interest for Quebec. » 
"In addition to exploring the different ways of economic and commercial collaboration, we will continue to encourage the multiplication of cultural ties. For example, many Quebec artists have occurred in recent years to the prestigious International Arts Festival of Edinburgh. » 
The first two ministers also exchanged their respective political situations and concluded that Quebecois and Scottish themselves decide their own destiny.
