MONTREAL - The Quebec Prime Minister Pauline Marois, wanted to pay tribute to Ms. Louise Laurin, committed and tireless militant for the causes of secularism and sovereignty. "I had the opportunity to rub shoulders with Ms. Laurin several times, as part of our common commitments. It was a woman of convictions, whose journey is imbued with a remarkable coherence. » 
Pauline Marois pointed out how much the fighting of Ms. Laurin took place at the forefront, so much so that they are still relevant. "Making Quebec a sovereign country that all citizens will be united by a common language and culture, it is still the meaning of our political action today. Long before these topics occupy the place that is theirs in our current public space, Louise Laurin told us about secularism, integrating new Quebeckers, school child care and the importance of developing a Québécois strong citizenship. For her, all these topics were intimately linked. » 
The departure of Ms. Laurin occurs while the Quebec government promises to be active on each of these issues. "For a long time again, Louise Laurin's action will continue to produce his effects. We will inspire ourselves with its determination to carry out the expensive projects. In the immediate future, however, our thoughts go to the relatives of Ms. Laurin, "added the Prime Minister.
