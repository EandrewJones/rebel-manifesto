Québec- The Prime Minister of Quebec, Pauline Marois, emphasizes the essential contribution of Quebec women workers to the development and influence of society. 
"In terms of innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship, Quebeckers and Quebeckers respond present. At all times, they are people who put, as the expression says, the heart to the work. May 1 is an opportunity to remind us that no economic, social or cultural development would be possible without everyone's contribution. We are all links of a large chain, "supported Pauline Marois. 
To emphasize the opportunity, and as the tradition does, the Prime Minister spoke with the heads of the three large union plants: the President of the Confederation of National Trade Unions, Jacques Létourneau, the Chairman of the Centrale des Trade Unions of Quebec Louise Chabot, and the President of the Quebec Workers Federation, Michel Arsenault. They discussed priority issues such as public finances, natural resources, workers' funds, Bill C 377 and the National Employment Insurance Review Board, set up following changes brought to the plan by the federal government. 
"The workforce is Quebec's first resource and by far its most valuable. Workers are guarantors of our prosperity. You have to be careful to protect the rights and interests of all, and finding appropriate solutions to the challenges that challenge us, "concluded Quebec's Prime Minister.
