Qu√©bec- On this National Day of the Patriots, the Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, calls on the population to celebrate and remember a decisive slice of its history. 
"Today, Quebeckers and Quebeckers can emphasize the National Day of the Patriots. This is an opportunity for all of us to revisit our history and in particular that of the struggle of the patriots for better social justice and greater freedom. It is the story of courageous women and men who have defended their ideals and their convictions. We can greet the courage and tenacity of these people, our ancestors, to whom we owe our democratic society. They knew how to mark their time, change their destiny and ours. Celebrate together this very significant festival, "said Pauline Marois. 
It was in 2002 that the Government of Quebec proclaimed, by decree, the National Day of the Patriots. Introduced on Monday preceding May 25 of each year, she replaces Dollard's Day. Thus, we wanted to better assert the events of May 1837 where the patriots held public meetings across Quebec after the London government's refusal to accept their claims. The text of the decree stipulates that "this holiday will emphasize the struggle of the patriots of 1837-1838 for the national recognition of our people, for his political freedom and to obtain a system of democratic government".
