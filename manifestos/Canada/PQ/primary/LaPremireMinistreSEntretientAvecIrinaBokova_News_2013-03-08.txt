Quebec- Prime Minister Pauline Marois has had a warm interview this morning with the Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, passing in the capital to receive a doctorate honoris causa from Laval University. During private interview, Ms. Marois confirmed to the Executive Director that Qu√©bec intends to continue its participation in UNESCO's work, although the Government of Quebec is not a full Member State of this organization. 
"Quebec must seize all the opportunities he has to play a role, to make his voice heard and promote his expertise on the international scene. As such, UNESCO offers us a great forum and we hoped to continue to contribute in the future, "said the premier. 
Quebec is actively engaged in UNESCO's work, which focuses on education, culture, the diversity of cultural expressions and science. In Education, Quebec closely follows activities related to free educational resources (REL), adult training and the integration of children in difficulty. It also strongly contributes to the promotion of UNESCO Chairs, while 10 of the 14 Chairs of the UN International Organization are on its territory. 
In cultural matters, Pauline Marois reminded Ms. Bokova that the priority of Quebec is the implementation of the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, adopted in 2005. "In this era of accelerated globalization, the Protection of national crops must be a priority. Because it is through culture and its various forms of expression that peoples are forging their identity and determine their future. Quebec has played an important role since the beginning of the work on the implementation of the Convention and we intend to continue our efforts in this direction, "said Marois.
