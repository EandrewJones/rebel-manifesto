Montreal - Prime Minister of Quebec, Pauline Marois, and the Minister Delegate to Aboriginal Affairs, Elizabeth Larouche, offer their best wishes for all Aboriginal people in Quebec and invite the population, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, to highlight the National Day of Indigenous Peoples . 
"That this day is a privileged moment for all Aboriginal people in Quebec. This is the ideal opportunity to celebrate and honor your cultures, your languages, your traditions and your history, "said the premier, who, moreover, participates today in Montreal with an important meeting with representatives of The Inuit Nation. 
For its part, the Minister Delegate to Aboriginal Affairs will highlight the national day of indigenous peoples in his district of Abitibi-East, by participating in the activities organized by the center of Aboriginal friendship in Val-d'Or. 
"I invite all Quebeckers, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, to emphasize this day. Better we will know each other, better we will cohabit. I hope we continued in the path of collaboration, respect and dialogue, "said Mrs. Larouche. 
Recall that it was in 1990 that the National Assembly of Quebec unanimously adopted a motion recognizing on June 21 as "National Day of Indigenous Peoples".
