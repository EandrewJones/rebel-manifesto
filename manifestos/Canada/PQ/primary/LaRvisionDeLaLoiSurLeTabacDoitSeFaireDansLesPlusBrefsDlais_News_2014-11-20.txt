Québec- The Quebec Party joins its voice with those of the Quebec coalition for the control of tobacco and the Canadian Cancer Society, claiming a revision of the tobacco law as soon as possible. The member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, the protection of youth, home care and prevention, Jean-François Lisée, and the member for Taillon and spokesperson concerning Health and accessibility to care, Diane Lamarre, also ask the government to act quickly on this issue. 
"Reducing smoking is a critical goal of the health of our fellow citizens. Tobacco laws have had positive effects on the smoking rate in Quebec: it increased by 35% in the mid-1990s to 20%. We can still do better; Other effective measures can be put in place, and this goes through a revision of the law. Unfortunately, we learned this week that the Minister Delegate to Public Health, Lucie Charlebois, will not submit a bill before Christmas, as she was committed to it, "said Jean-François Lisée. 
Remember that the work in this case was started by the Government of the Parti Party; The Commission on Health and Social Services has also made its recommendations, and our government was clear about its intentions to act quickly. 
"With what we know today damage caused by smoking, we are responsible for ensuring that our young people never start to smoke. We are concerned and very disappointed by this decline of the Liberal government, especially after public health cuts announced with Bill 10. We should rather privilege public health and quickly update a law that dates from 2005. In addition, It would be clearly an investment; In Quebec, one third of the costs incurred by the days of hospitalization is directly attributable to smoking. This also demonstrates the dangers of politicizing the health system, as provided for in Bill 10, as it becomes difficult to implement prevention measures that will result in 10, 20 or 40 years, "concluded Diane Lamarre.
