"The Government of Quebec had committed to better support those who help people. This is what we do today by improving support for organizations in employability development. These organizations play a key role in the economic growth of Quebec by allowing, every year, thousands of Quebecers and Quebeckers to integrate the labor market and improve their living conditions. They are essential partners to the fight against poverty and social exclusion and thus contribute to building a more just, more solidarity and prosperous society, "said Minister Maltese. 
This investment will also increase the basic funding granted to the 110 Quebec Youth-Employment Junctions. 
Note that this announcement is part of the government orientations on which the pillar "solidarity: a wealth for Quebec" rests, one of the four pillars of the action of the government, with integrity, prosperity and the identity. These guidelines, made public on October 30 by the Prime Minister Ms. Pauline Marois, guide the government's action in the implementation of measures aimed at improving the well-being of the most vulnerable individuals and families. The government wants to give a new impetus to solidarity, an inseparable value of collective wealth.
