One of the most important things for me as the premier is to take care of our world. This is a goal that guides me every day in my decisions. All the actions of my government aim to improve the lives of Quebeckers. 
Since our entry into office, we have had to work very hard to revive Quebec. During the years in the power of the previous government, our collective solidarity was mistreated. It was the reign of everyone-for-yourself, and it ended with an unprecedented social crisis in our recent history. 
To solve these problems, we had to make difficult decisions and to put brave gestures. Our efforts have borne fruit. 
We can now work to strengthen Quebec to build a more proud nation, richer and more solidarity. 
I announced yesterlle deployment of our new solidarity policy. It aims for a great priority: to build a more equitable Quebec in which everyone can have access to the essential. A Quebec where all people can aspire to the greatest achievements. This is a major step towards a more just society and more in line with Quebec's values. 
Our nation was built on solidarity. Our development and prosperity are linked to our ability to work together to the common good. 
A Quebec who takes care of his world is the legacy we have received. 
It is also the commitment I take to you to build a more proud Quebec, more supportive and richer. 
To build a stronger Quebec.
