Quebec- The hon. Member for Saint-Jérôme and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, the member for Rousseau and spokesman for the Parti Québécois in finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, and the hon. Member for Chicoutimi, Parliamentary Leader and spokesperson for economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Stéphane Bédard, urged the Liberal government to act for employment, while it has lost more than 4000, at Full time, in August. 
"Job losses continue and Liberal Prime Minister Philippe Couillard persists in doing nothing. The unemployment rate in Quebec reaches 8%. Quebec continues its under-performance since the arrival of the Liberal government. I suggested to the Prime Minister to hold an economic summit bringing together all the actors in order to propose solutions. He always refuses. The population is worried, I see it when I tour. What does the government expect to act? For my part, I will continue to meet Quebeckers and economic decision-makers, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"The Minister of Finance must apt the filing of the economic and financial update, as we asked him last week. In addition to the jobs lost this summer, GDP has further declined by 0.5% in May, after declining 0.3% in April and 0.1% in March. While the budget anticipated a 2% GDP increase, growth forecasts for 2015 were lowered at only 1.3% by Desjardins. Quebeckers need to know where we are and what is the government's budgetary situation, "added Nicolas Marceau. 
"The refusal of Philippe Couillard to present an economic policy and liberal austerity undermine the labor market. The government is only acting on the column of expenses; He forgets that of income, and we see the results. There is no plan, only improvisation. Only 7.9% of full-time jobs created in Canada have been in Quebec. The Liberals must stop closing your eyes and hope; They must act as soon as possible, the situation requires it, "concluded Stéphane Bédard.
