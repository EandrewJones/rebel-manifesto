Do you leave your neighbor managing your income and expenses? You would let him decide what is better for your children? Of course not! You are best placed to know the needs of your family. It's up to you to decide to buy new winter boots to your youngest because it's necessary, or investing in a building building because it is the best choice of placement in your situation. You do not need the others to decide in your place. You are able to do it. It's the same for a country! This is a little what Pauline Marois tell us in sovereignty, a question of pride!. 
And the money you do with this revenue building, would you like to give half to your neighbor? Would you like him to reinvest it in his house, to increase the value of his property? As Pauline Marois says, "If we want to be richer, there is no better way than independence. It's true for people like peoples. " Sovereignty, it's paying! 
Sovereignty is also the best way to make our culture shine. It would allow us to become a world leader in green energies. Imagine the possibilities! 
And the queen, you have enough? If Quebec became a country, we could finally get rid of the monarchy to equip itself with a modern political system. 
It's time to act! 
Broadcasting a ticket, go to love and share the videos of Mrs. Marois on YouTube, talk about it around you! 
And do as Marc-Andr√©! Enjoy the end of the week to save your little 30-second video capsule where you will tell us why you are sovereignist, and send us everything toPaysqc@gmail.com. If you respect the detict and you promote sovereignty, we will broadcast your message. Pass the word!

Every little gesture counts. You have to go out, talk and convince. 
Sovereignty, it depends on us!
