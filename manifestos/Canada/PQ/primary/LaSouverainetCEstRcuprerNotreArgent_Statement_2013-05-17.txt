At this moment, Quebeckers pay for two ministries of finance, two ministries of health, etc. In short, we pay for two governments when we would be much better served with one! 
Imagine, in 2010, the administrative duplication between the Government of Quebec and Ottawa cost $ 7.5 billion in Quebec. It's not nothing: it's $ 950 per Quebec, a total of $ 3800 for a family of four! 
And when we say we would be better served, it's really the case. In 2009, the federal government paid $ 10 billion to save the Ontario automotive industry. On this amount, 2 billion came from Quebec through our taxes. 
In 2011, it was $ 32 billion that Ottawa invested in Nova Scotia and British Columbia to finance the construction of ships. 
However, during the Quebec forestry crisis, and despite repeated requests, the Quebec industry received only at the $ 300 million in federal aid. 
Imagine if these $ 8.4 billion sent to Ontario, Nova Scotia and British Columbia had been invested with us, according to our needs, to create jobs and wealth here! The economic benefits would have been immense. 
In a sovereign Quebec, our money will be used to enrich us.
