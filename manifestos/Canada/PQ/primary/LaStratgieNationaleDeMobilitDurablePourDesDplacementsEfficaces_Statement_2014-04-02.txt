At the last election campaign, I was asked what was our priority for the future of the metropolitan area. Very spontaneously, I replied that road congestion had to be reduced and improving the fluidity of transport. 
That's always what I think today. In 20 years, the costs of congestion in Montreal would be from $ 500 million in 1993 to $ 1.8 billion in 2013. Road congestion increased, the road network is saturated. 
The future is to improve the fluidity of circulation while decreasing our greenhouse gas emissions and improving the quality of life of families of all Quebec. Indeed, the time we pass in its car, we do not pass it with its children, to prepare good meals, to indulge in our leisure or physical activity. 
For us, the choice is clear: we must act resolutely to develop collective transport. 
It is this desire to improve the fluidity of traffic, to facilitate the movement of public transport users and to allow workers to have an attractive choice for their travels that led us to develop the national strategy for sustainable mobility. 
It's good for the environment, it's good for the economy, it's good for our quality of life. 
We have the best plan. We have the best team. And we have the determination.
