Quebec, on May 7, 2017- The spokesperson for the Quebecois Health, Care and Home Support Party, Diane Lamarre, denounces the privatization of the Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette, who granted The superclinic doctors permission to engage themselves professionals in care outside CISS and CIUSS. It also denounces the withdrawal of the obligation, for the superclinic, to be opened 84 hours a week. 
IN SHORT 
"In his most recent understanding with the doctors concerning the superclinics, the Minister of Health has made them an unprecedented gift. As before, the superclinic staff came from the public health network, the superclinic will now be able to hire professionals in the private sector. In Catimini, Gaétan Barrette privatized the superclinic network, it's a liberal "superprivatization", denounced Diane Lamarre. 
"After cutting unscrupulously and without justification in hospitals, CLSCs and CHSLDs, among others, the minister spontaneously finds money for private clinics. For three years, he has been funding a private business model and weakens the means of the public, though guiding equitable access for all to health care, "she continued. 
"Allowing the superclinic to hire staff with the Ministry of Health will not improve the accessibility and quality of services, especially since they no longer have to be opened a minimum of 84 hours a week. Why and for whom did the minister take these decisions? What interests are they used? The minister, again, relegates the interest of the population in the background and continues to privatize the health network, "concluded the speech.
