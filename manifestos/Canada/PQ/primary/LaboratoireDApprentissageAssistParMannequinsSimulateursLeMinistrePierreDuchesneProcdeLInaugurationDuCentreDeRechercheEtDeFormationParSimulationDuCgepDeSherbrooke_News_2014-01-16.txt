Sherbrooke- The Minister of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology, Mr. Pierre Duchesne, proceeded to the inauguration of the Research and Training Center by Simulation (Cerefs), related to the pilot project Assisted learning laboratory for Sherbrooke CEGEP simulators. Recall that this pilot project has seen the day with government financial support totaling $ 970,000, including $ 670,000 from the Ministry of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology and $ 300,000, from the Ministry of Health and Social Services. 
"The establishment of this new laboratory demonstrates the importance we provide for the training of the student health population, where the need for skilled labor are particularly high. By providing innovative facilities, the Sherbrooke CEGEP will allow its students to stand out and develop the skills required to exercise their future career, in addition to encouraging them to persevere. This will also meet the needs of the environment for continuing education, research and development in the field of health, "said Minister Duchesne. 
Cerefs is used by students from four curricula, two in vocational training (health, assistance and nursing and assistance to the health facility) and two in technical training (nursing and technical care of inhalotherapy). The availability of the new laboratory should promote the increase in registrations in these curricula. It also aims to ensure better preparation of students in the internships and the practice of the profession. Cerefs also allows them to evolve in an interdisciplinary context, by rubbing shoulders and other nursing staff, as is the case in the hospital setting.
