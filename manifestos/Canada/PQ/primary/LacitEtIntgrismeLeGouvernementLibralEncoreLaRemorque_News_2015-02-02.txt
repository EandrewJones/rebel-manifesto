Quebec- The hon. Member for Taschereau, parliamentary leader and official opposition on secularism, Agnès Maltese, asks the Liberal Prime Minister to cease to be at the trailer of others on issues affecting the secularism of the laity State and fundamentalism. 
"This time, it is the mayor of Montreal, from Paris, who announces a summit on integration and security in Montreal. We will look with interest the opportunity to participate. But, for its part, the Prime Minister remains vague and still refuses to give us a specific timing of the actions that his government intends to do on these issues. He continues to maintain the blur and play on the words to hide his discomfort and inaction, "said Agnès Maltais. 
"As everyone wants the government to take responsibility, we applaud those who have the courage to make decisions to protect our youth from hazardous speeches. It takes tags, you need leadership. The Mayor of the Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve arrondissement has agreed well in the Imam Chaoui file. Now, in order to assume his responsibilities, the government must only wait for another Imam Radical asks for authorization to preach in another city or district of Montreal. It's time to finish with the case by case, "she added. 
Observatory on religious fundamentalism  The member recalled the next filing of his bill to set up an observatory on religious fundamentalism. "The government has not yet responded favorably to our proposal. The Observatory would allow us to understand, document and prevent religious fundamentalism. The government must tell us what it intends to do, precisely, on this issue, "Agnès Maltais concluded.
