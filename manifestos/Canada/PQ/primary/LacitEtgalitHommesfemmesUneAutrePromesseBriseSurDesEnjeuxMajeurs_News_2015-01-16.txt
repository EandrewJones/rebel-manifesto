Quebec- The hon. Member for Taschereau and the official opposition on secularism, Agnès Maltese, observe once again that the Liberal government continues to repel the issue of secularism and equality between men and the women. 
In the aftermath of the election, the leader of the Liberal Party had said that he would tackle the problem "very early" in the mandate. In June, the Minister of Justice, Stephanie Vallée, had promised that a bill would be tabled in the fall of 2014, a commitment that was obviously not respected. Yesterday she said it would be before summer. Today, the Prime Minister finally confessed that he postponed this election engagement. Clearly, the government is sailing in this case. 
"Philippe Couillard has never intended to tackle the issues related to the secularism of the state and equality between men and women. What he wants is to sweep these questions under the carpet. The only thing he has made on this issue since his election is shoveling the problem forward, "said Agnès Maltais. 
"This is a new promise broken by the Prime Minister. Why does he act as well? The answer is simple: it is not comfortable with this file. He knows perfectly that Quebeckers do not share his vision. When he talks about these issues, he quickly rides the tone, an obvious sign of his discomfort in the face of these questions, "said the member of the Quebecois party.
