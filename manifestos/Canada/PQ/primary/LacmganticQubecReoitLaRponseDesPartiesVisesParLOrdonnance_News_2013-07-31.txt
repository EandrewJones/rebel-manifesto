Lac-Mégantic- The Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet, announces that Montreal, Maine & Atlantique Canada Cie, Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway Ltd, Western Petroleum Company and World Fuel Services Corporation responded to the ordinance that was served on Monday, but did not commit themselves clearly or firmly to respect the terms. The Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks (MDDEFP) and its lawyers conduct an analysis of their responses to define its scope. 
"It's still too early to apprehend the concrete effects of the answer we have received, but it goes without saying that we do not consider this answer as satisfactory in the short term. In any case, the Ordinance is a means that will allow us to ensure that the work is a total and comprehensive term, and that companies will assume the financial burden of future restoration operations. The city center must be rebuilt and the return to normal must be done quickly, for the benefit of the economy of the region and the quality of life of the citizens of Lac-Mégantic, "said the Minister Blanchet. 
The Government is currently ensuring with the City of Lac-Mégantic strong mechanisms that will ensure the continuation of operations and their payment in the event of a lack of companies. Remember that if the Ordinance Parties refuse or neglect to submit in full, the Minister may avail himself of his power to enforce the expense of the targeted parties and to recover the costs in accordance with the Article 113 of the Environmental Quality Act. 
In the meantime, the department ensures that the work continues without interruption and that all the workforce and the necessary equipment are deployed to ensure effective action in the field.
