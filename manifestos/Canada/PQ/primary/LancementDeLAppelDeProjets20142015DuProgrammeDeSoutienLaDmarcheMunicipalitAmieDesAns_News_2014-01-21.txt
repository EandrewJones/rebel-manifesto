Quebec- The Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister Responsible for Seniors, Dr. Réjean Hébert, today announced the launch of the new project call for the Program of Support for the Municipality of Seniors (MADA), for the financial year 2014-2015. 
"The success of the last project call has shown that the municipalities and the MRCs of Quebec are at the heart of making a larger place to our elders in society. It is therefore natural to continue in this direction and to continue to offer our support for the growing number of communities that are ready to make concrete gestures by engaging in the MADA approach, "said Dr. Hébert. 
This project call allows municipalities and MRCs to receive financial support to help them engage in the MADA approach. Applications may be forwarded to the Ministry of Health and Social Services as of January 20, until April 17, 2014 inclusive. The form and information on the participation in the call for projects are available on the sitaines.gouv.qc.ca/mada/. 
Remember that the MADA approach is aimed at all municipalities and all the MRCs du Québec. To participate in the program, they must commit to fostering the integration of seniors to the community by adapting services and infrastructure to their needs and by allowing them to participate more actively in society, with the support of the whole population. Quebec now has more than 700 MADA projects, which is worth recognizing as a world leader in this area by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
"We are hopeful to achieve our goal of 860 municipalities and MRCs in 2017 in the MADA approach, because we make progress every year in this direction. The seriousness of our commitment is quite consistent with our home support and self-reliance projects. The future of our society must go through a better inclusion of our elders: it is a real priority for us, "concluded Dr. Hébert.
