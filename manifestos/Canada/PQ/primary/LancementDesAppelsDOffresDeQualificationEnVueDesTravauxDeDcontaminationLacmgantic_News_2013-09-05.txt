Québec- The Ministry of Sustainable Development, the Environment, Wildlife and Parks Announces the launch of qualification calls for tenders for decontamination work in Lac-Mégantic. Characterization work to determine the extent of soil contamination are being completed and the department will soon be able to identify the deadlines and technologies that will need to be prioritized during the decontamination process. 
It is clear that the decontamination of this site orders major operations. To this end, the Department today launches a series of four qualification calls for tenders, including two in construction work and two in professional services. Contractors and interested firms to exercise their know-how are invited to complete a qualifying file that will be the subject of a rigorous analysis of a selection committee. This approach will build a list of qualified companies that will be able to undertake work quickly. The documents will be accessible on the government's electronic tendering system (SEAO). The first contracts will be granted from the beginning of October. 
Also mention that the work deemed priority, for example operations related to the decontamination of the railway, will be carried out parallel to the tender process that has just begun. In addition, recovery and cleaning works are continuing at Lac-Mégantic. Recall that it is the Pomerleau firm who has received the mandate to coordinate this work.
