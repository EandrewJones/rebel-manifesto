With two components, the first intended for consumers and the second to retailers and suppliers, the purpose of the competition is to promote the purchase of products from us certified by Food in Quebec. "I am proud to associate me with this original contest that highlights the know-how and creativity of our bioalimentary industry in the food promotion of Quebec. It is through initiatives like that that we will increase the proportion of Quebeckers' food that is satisfied with Quebec's food, which is one of the objectives pursued through our policy. Food sovereignty, "said the minister. 
Let us mention that many of the 156 participants of the 2012 competition reported highly positive benefits, up to 300%, on their sales of quality certified products in Quebec during the course of activity in the shops. This demonstrates that showing the origin of the products is a paid option. 
"In a context where 70% of food purchases are done at the supermarket, large chains are undoubtedly exceptional vitrines for Quebec's products. It should not be forgotten that these are also offered among retailers who exploit small or medium-sized facilities. That's why we chose to create a particular category for them this year. We invite Quebeckers to pay particular attention to the origin of the products they buy, no matter where they do their purchases, "Florent Gravel said. 
"With this contest, retailers give our products extraordinary visibility. I invite Quebeckers to seize this opportunity to discover the foods from here and to be used to registering them on their grocery list, "said Francois Gendron.  A treasure hunt to discover the foods of Quebec
