Quebec- The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, takes advantage of the 14th Annual Forum of the Archeo-Qu√©bec Network to make public plan of action in archeology and thus affirm its commitment to archaeological heritage. 
"Rich and remarkable, the archaeological heritage reveals unpublished pages of our history. It was therefore essential to equip us with clear guidelines to keep and showcase this cultural, historical and identity resource. The public plan of action today is the belief that the archaeological heritage is everyone's business and represents a key component of the Quebec cultural landscape, "said Minister Kotto. 
This action plan aims, among other things, to register the archaeological heritage in the cultural, social and economic development of Quebec. Three main orientations will guide its implementation, either the prioritization of ministerial action affecting the knowledge, protection, and development of this heritage, the strengthening of interdepartmental consultation and the support of the partners of the environment. This plan is the affirmation of the Ministry of Culture and Communications commitment to the protection and development of this rich and essential heritage to Quebec society. 
The Action Plan was developed in the wake of the adoption of the Cultural Heritage Act and the revision of the Ministry of Culture and Communications Regulations on Archaeological Research. It contains a series of actions aimed at improving practices, tools archaeologists and promoters and to make this fascinating domain known. 
The Archeology Action Plan is available on the Ministry of Culture and Communications website, atwww.mcc.gouv.qc.ca.
