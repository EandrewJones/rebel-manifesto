Québec- On the occasion of the study of the budgetary appropriations of the Ministry of Culture and Communications, Component Charter of the French language, the member for Bourget and spokesman for the Quebecois Party of the Charter of the French Language, Maka Kotto, denounces the government's procrastination with respect to the display language. He recalled that the minister and the Prime Minister had promised a year ago to strengthen the law 101 to force retailers with a trademark in English to add a description in French. 
"By procrastination or ideology, the Liberal government systematically refuses to be more offensive to defend the French language. Either the promised regulations are always waiting for, the government refuses to legislate. The language is the foundation on which the Quebec nation is based; We need to invest the efforts to ensure its progress and radiation. For fifteen years, the progression of French is running out of steam in Quebec. And the Liberal government is far from reassuring, "said Maka Kotto. 
"On the side of the working language - especially on construction sites, for example those of Davie or Chum - the minister promised a settlement already a year ago. Since then, nothing. It's the same thing in the display folder, for which the announced regulation will not change anything. As for the renewal of the common intervention strategy for Greater Montréal, we had been promised consultations in the fall and a new milling for April 1st, but we are still waiting. We said it last year: the Quebec Office of the French language increased from 8 to 4 inspectors, while the number of complaints increases. However, the thanked inspectors have not even been replaced, "he added.
