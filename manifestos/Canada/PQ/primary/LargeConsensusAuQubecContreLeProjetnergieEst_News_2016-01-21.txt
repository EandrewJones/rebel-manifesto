Quebec- As a result of the decision of the Montreal Metropolitan Community (CMM) to oppose the Energy Pipeline project is TransCanada, the Quebec Party spokesperson for sustainable development, environment and control Against climate change, Mathieu Traversy, as well as the spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, urge the Government of Philippe Couillard to note the total lack of social acceptability and to give up the project. 
"The decision of the CMM confirms that the energy pipeline project is not receiving any membership. The CMM includes almost half of the population of Quebec. It is therefore a clear and strong message that is sent today to the government: energy is will not go! Quebeckers refuse to serve as a highway for the export of oil sands oil, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
"Month after month, we find that the energy project would bring nothing in Quebec. Too modest economic benefits for too important risks. Instead of opposing Quebec's energy projects, can Philippe Couillard defend the interests of Quebec and oppose the ambitions of TransCanada? Quebeckers do not have to pay the price of decisions made for the sole benefit of the rest of Canada, "said Alain Therrien. 
The Parti Québécois also recalls that independent Quebec would be stronger and better equipped to combat climate change. "As long as we are a province, projects like TransCanada's Energy Pipeline will try to make Quebec a simple route for Alberta oil. We would have everything to gain our own choices, "concluded Mathieu Traversy.
