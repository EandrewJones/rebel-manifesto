Quebec- The member for Vachon and sentence of the official transport opposition, Martine Ouellet, as well as the member for Verchères and Spokespersons in Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, denounce federal laxity as to Rail safety and ask the Quebec government to put pressure so that Ottawa fulfills its commitments. 
Yesterday, in the wake of the report on the Lac-Mégantic rail tragedy, it was learned that the Transportation Safety Board (TSB) was concerned about the lack of supplied responses and commitments made by Transport Canada. 
"According to the TSB, there has not yet been put in place an effective monitoring system that would ensure that all railway companies are adequately inspected; this is unacceptable! A year and a half has elapsed since the tragedy of Lac-Mégantic, and Transport Canada has still not brought all the fixes necessary to prevent such an accident from happening again. The Quebec Minister of Transport, Robert Poëti must stand in front of Ottawa and meet with his federal counterpart. If he does not defend Quebeckers, who will do it? "Said Martine Ouellet. 
"Ottawa continues to escape his responsibilities. This voluntary blindness of the government must stop. Clear gestures must be made to ensure the safety of the population. It is unacceptable that all the necessary measures have not yet been deployed. The federal government must fulfill its commitments, "concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
