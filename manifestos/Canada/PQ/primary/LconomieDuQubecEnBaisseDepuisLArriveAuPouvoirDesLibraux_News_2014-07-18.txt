Quebec, July 18, 2014 - the member for Saint-Jérôme and the official opposition spokesman for economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, was concerned about the numbers Published by the Quebec Institute of Statistics this morning, which indicate a decline in economic activity and GDP in April. 
"The Liberals had promised that their mere arrival in power was going to grow the economy. Now, we saw this morning that the effect of their arrival, it is a decline in GDP and economic activity, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
The figures published this morning indicate that Quebec's GDP declined in April after the January, February and March increases. Twelve of the 20 major sectors of Quebec economic activity have declined in April, the largest being in the production of goods. 
"While illustrating the improvisation of his government by holding contradictory remarks about the prosecution of the Roman project earlier this week, the Prime Minister realized that the lack of economic and industrial policy leads Quebec in a stalemate and a collective impoverishment? ", Questioned the spokesman for the Parti Québécois in the area of economy. 
The Quebec party government has launched the Employment Priority Economic Policy on October 7, 2013 and this one gave results. 
"The Liberal government has slowed this momentum by putting aside this policy, for only partisan purposes. When will Quebec give back an economic policy worthy of the name? Instead of leaving and improvisation, the government must bring the state to act as an impulse officer to the economic activity and enrichment of the community, as is the case in many countries ", Concluded the hon. Member for Saint? Jérôme.
