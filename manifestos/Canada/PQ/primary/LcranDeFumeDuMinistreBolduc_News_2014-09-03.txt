Quebec- The member of Pointe-Aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for primary and secondary education and school perseverance, Nicole Léger, asks the Minister of Education, Leisure and Sport, Yves Bolduc, cessing his diversion maneuvers to make the blind cuts he imposes on Quebec schools. 
"The idea of evaluating teachers is nothing less than a smoke screen to divert the attention of the population of massive, current and future cuts, which will affect the parents and the parents' portfolios of Quebec. The minister tries to all kinds of ways not to talk about the real business or $ 215,000 premium, which he has to repay in full, "said Nicole Léger. 
The hon. Member recalls that in recent weeks, the Liberal government continues to launch disjointed ideas and that it had to make many declines, especially about books, the abolition of CEGEPs and tuition fees at the University . This new maneuver is just a step further in this series of fake. 
"Quebec deserves better than a minister who launches ideas elaborated on the corner of a table. It is clear that the government has no overall vision for education. Yves Bolduc proves once again that he does not have the stuff of a good Minister of Education, "added the spokesman. 
Support teachers 
Regarding the evaluation of teachers, Nicole Léger emphasizes the great disparities between schools from one region to another, even from one city to another. How does one evaluate a teacher working in a disadvantaged environment from another who works in a more favored environment? How do we evaluate teachers with more students in difficulty in their class? 
"Teachers need to be supported and accompanied, especially in the context where many leave in their first five years of practice. In addition, the upcoming cuts do not reassure teachers and families in Quebec. It is not by launching balloons that Minister Bolduc will improve things, "concluded Nicole Léger.
