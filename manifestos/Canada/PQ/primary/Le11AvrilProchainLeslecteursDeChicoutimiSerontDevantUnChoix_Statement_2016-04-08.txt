Chicoutimi is in the heart of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, our region. 
A region that is not limited to producing resources to large centers. A region that is an asset and not an expense for Quebec. A region composed of citizens who participate in the advancement of Quebec in all sectors of activity. 
We are entitled to the same services, regardless of where we live in Quebec. And we have the duty to demand respect for us, our parents, and especially for our children so they grow up, work and live here in Chicoutimi. 
It is for this reason that I wish to represent Chicoutimi voters under the banner of the Parti Québécois. I think together we can contribute to the development of Chicoutimi and our region. This fits perfectly in my experience based on economic development, entrepreneurship and the high technology sector. 
In this area, we have recently proposed an innovative idea to create jobs in new technologies. I am confident that we can attract and develop a data center here in the constituency. We have all the assets to succeed in diversifying our economy and create jobs. 
This is just one example of our proposals. We will continue to exchange with the citizens of Chicoutimi and we will put forward solutions to get things done: 
On April 11, Chicoutimi voters will be in front of a choice. 
I invite them to continue to be at the forefront of development and economic modernization. Like them, I think it's our SMEs and entrepreneurship that are the basis of economic enrichment. This enrichment which then allows us to finance our solidarity, particularly in education and health. 
On April 11, we vote PartiBécois.I count on you.
