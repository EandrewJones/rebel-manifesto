Quebec- The Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, judges that the two great objectives that the Liberal Chief Philippe Couillard had set at the 2014 election campaign, or to enhance the ethics of his party and stimulate The economy, resulted in a lamentable failure. 
"In terms of ethics, the last few weeks have been marked by the arrest of its former colleague Nathalie Normandeau, the accusations of corruption against one of the most important collectors of the Liberal Party, Marc-Yvan side, and, finally, the Prime Minister's procrastination When he was about his friend, the member for Louis-Hébert, Sam Hamad, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
On the economy side, the Liberal government has created any jobs in the last twelve months. On Friday, we learn that in $ 22,500 full-time jobs were lost during the month of March. In addition, on page C.26 of its own budget, the government plans to create less than 30,000 jobs in 2016 and less than 30,000 jobs in 2017. These figures prove the abandonment of the promise to create 250,000 jobs. 
"The Prime Minister has refused to confirm his choice to no longer write the promise, the goal, the liberal myth of the 250,000 jobs in the budget. It is clear that he admits having sold a mirage to voters at the last election campaign, "added Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"Philippe Couillard had promised to change the Liberal Party. He must recognize the problem today: he did not make good change. He dropped the economy and kept ethical problems rather than reverse, "concluded the leader of the Parti Québécois.
