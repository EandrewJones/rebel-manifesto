Quebec- The Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, wishes to clarify the meaning of the words he has held, this afternoon at the end of the Québec Québécois Caucus in Saint-Jean- Sur-Richelieu. 
In order to understand the inaction and obvious malaise of the Prime Minister when it comes to secularism, on the one hand, and the fight against fundamentalism, on the other hand, Stéphane Bédard questioned the reasons for the explain. Under no circumstances would the Leader of the Official Opposition suggest that the Prime Minister wants to implant in Quebec different practices that violate human rights and who are running, at the moment, in Saudi Arabia. 
Stéphane Bédard wants this precision to better understand the meaning of his remarks and, above all, that it does not detour the attention of the real issue, the necessity, for the Prime Minister, to act now to better understand , to document and prevent phenomena that lead to the radicalization of certain individuals. 
The Prime Minister should not attempt to hide behind false pretexts for, once again, try to postpone the debate that must take place.
