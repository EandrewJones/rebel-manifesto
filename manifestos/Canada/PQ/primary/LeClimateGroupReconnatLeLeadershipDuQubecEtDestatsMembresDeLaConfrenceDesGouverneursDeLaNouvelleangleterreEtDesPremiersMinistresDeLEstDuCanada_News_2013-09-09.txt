Quebec- The Quebec Prime Minister Pauline Marois, is pleased to receive on behalf of the New England Governor Conference and the Eastern Canada Prime Ministers (CGNA-PMEC), the price "leader in The fight against climate change "delivered by Leclimate Group. This recognition highlights the leadership of the Member States to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and the results achieved by the governments of the region in terms of adaptation to climate change and sustainable transport. 
"It is an honor to receive, as a co-chair of this meeting, this award that recognizes the remarkable achievements of the members of the conference in the fight against climate change. For several years, we have positioned ourselves as precursors in this area and we have the strong intention of continuing our efforts to make our environment healthier for future generations. " 
Note that the CGNA-PMEC was the first group of federated States to take common and concrete measures through a 2001 regional action plan to deal with the challenges of climate change. This initiative allowed the region to achieve the objectives it had set for 2010. 
This distinction was sidelined from the 37th Annual Conference of the Governors of New England and the first ministers of Eastern Canada, which is concluded today in Malbaie. 
Founded in 2004, Leclimate Group is an independent non-profit organization that collaborates with multinationals, cities and governments of federated states and regions on the issue of climate change. Quebec has been a member since 2008.
