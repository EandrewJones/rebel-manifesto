Québec- The member for Taschereau and the Parliamentary Leader of the Official Opposition, Agnès Maltese, took advantage of the interpellation concerning child care to require the Government to the Government of the Staff Regulations (CSF) opinion on the subject liberal modulation of tariffs. 
"In Quebec, we decided to introduce a system that gave the choice to women, which allowed them to return to the labor market. The modulation of the rates makes us go back. It's very disturbing; It will encourage the return of work to black, as 30 years ago, before we put in place the network. Does the minister know the impact of modulation on women's autonomy? On their ability to access the job market or to return? Has it evaluated the impact on family-work-study conciliation? All these questions could be analyzed by the CSF, "said Agnès Maltais.
