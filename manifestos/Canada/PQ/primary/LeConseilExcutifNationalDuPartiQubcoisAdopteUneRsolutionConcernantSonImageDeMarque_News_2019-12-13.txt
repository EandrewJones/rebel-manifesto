Montreal, December 13, 2019 --Conformation to what had been announced at the Extraordinary National Congress of 9 and 10 November in Trois-Rivières, the National Executive Council commissioned a study on the party's brand image last month . The purpose of this study was to analyze the possibility of changing the name as well as the Quebec's logo. 
Having read the results of this study, the members of the National Executive Board of the Quebecois have made the decision not to change the name of the party. "The name of the Parti Québécois summarizes our mission, our commitment and the direction we want to take. We are the party of all Quebeckers and all Quebeckers, whether they arrived yesterday or 400 years ago; The party of all those who believe in Quebec and its ability to realize its full potential, "has summed Dieudonné Ella Oyono, president of the Parti Québécois. 
As for the possibility of making a change of graphic identity, which would pass by a new logo, it will be discussed following the race at the chieftaincy. Moreover, the rules concerning the latter will be adopted at the Coordination Conference on 1 February 2020. 
No further comments will be made regarding the study or resolution of the National Executive Board.
