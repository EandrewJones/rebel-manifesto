Quebec- The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and sentence of the official opposition in the field of justice, Alexandre Cloutier, reacted to the latest developments relating to the accident involving a spinning policeman who caused the death of a young person 5 year old, in February 2014 in Longueuil. He claims more transparency from the Director of Criminal and Criminal Prosecutions (PPCP). 
Earlier today, it was learned that the PCPP, after taking note of the recommendations of the Special Committee for the Analysis of the Independent Inquiry, finally tabled a charge against the Québec Security Police officer who participated In the intervention: he is accused of dangerous driving causing death. 
"Today's result has been too long. It is not normal that it took so much pressure - from the official opposition, the media and the parents of the young victim, among others - for the minister to intervene with the PCPP, who had decided, At first, not to charge the police officer, but without making his reasons known. Why did the family have to fight against the system to explain the ins and outs of the DPCP decision? It's insane, "lamented Alexandre Cloutier. 
Today, the member for Lac-Saint-Jean has put his hand to the Minister of Justice, Stéphanie Valley. "We ask him to intervene to ensure that the PCPP is now obliged to make its reasons public when it decides not to charge against a police officer in duty involved in a deadly accident or causing serious injury. The DPCP is not a court and must justify its decisions with the population, more importantly with the relatives of the victims, who are entitled to explanations. It is a question of transparency, which does not involve the independence of the PCPP, "he concluded.
