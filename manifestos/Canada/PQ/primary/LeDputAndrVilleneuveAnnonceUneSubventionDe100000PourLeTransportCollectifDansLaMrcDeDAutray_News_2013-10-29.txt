Quebec- The member for Berthier, Mr. André Villeneuve, is pleased to announce, on behalf of the Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the Territory, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, that a grant of $ 100,000 is granted to the Author Regional County Municipality for support for the operation of regional collective transportation. 
This grant is paid under the Government Assistance Program for Regional Collective Transportation for the development of collective transportation. 
This project is to operate a public transport service in the territory of the Regional County Municipality of Autray to provide the population with better transportation services by the maximum use of resources already in place. 
"By participating in the financing of collective transport, we invest in sustainable development and the mobility of people, an at the same time social, environmental and economic challenge that is at the heart of our government's mission. Finally, I am pleased that AuTray's MRC may have obtained the maximum amount granted under this program, "said Mr. Villeneuve. 
Collective transportation is one of the founding stones of the next Québec sustainable mobility policy. In the process of drawing up, this policy will take over from the Quebec collective transport policy. The new policy will place the user at the heart of his concerns and guide the actions that will be undertaken by 2020 to enhance the offer of collective transportation service throughout Quebec. The preparatory documents and some of the submissions deposited as part of the Ministry of Transportation website at the address www.mtq.gouv.qc.ca. 
The parameters of this program can be viewed on the website of the Ministry of Transport at the address www.mtq.gouv.qc.ca.
