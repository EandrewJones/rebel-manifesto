Prévost- vice-president of the National Assembly of Bertrand, Mr. Claude Cousineau, is pleased to announce today, on behalf of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the Territory, Minister of Transport And Member of Jonquière, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, that the Prévost City will benefit from maximum government financial assistance of $ 730,950 for the replacement of several drinking water and wastewater pipes in the city. This assistance is granted as part of the Québec-Municipalities Infrastructure Program (PIQM). 
Briefly, the project aims to replace drinking water pipes under certain segments of the streets of the elms, the cliff, therrien as well as the manse-wooded path. At the end of this work, drinking water pipes over 850 meters will be renewed in the city of Prévost. 
"I am very happy with the financial support today to the Prévost City. All Quebeckers must be able to benefit from access to quality public services. That's why our government is committed to providing municipalities with the support needed to renew and develop their infrastructure, "said MP Claude Cousineau. 
"By contributing to the maintenance and renewal of our public infrastructure, the government reiterates its willingness to support the social and economic development of municipalities and regions, in the interests of all Quebeckers and all Quebeckers", Minister Sylvain Gaudreault reported. 
The realization of this project requires maximum government financial assistance of $ 730,950 under the PIQM 1.5 component. With a total envelope of $ 462 million, this part of the PIQM program allows not only to ensure the sustainability of the infrastructures, but also to enhance the quality of life of the population and to create many jobs in all of the Regions of Quebec. 
The support of the Quebec government to the project is part of the 2013-2023 Quebec Infrastructure Plan (PQI) released last April. It should be remembered that this decennial plan will eventually result in $ 8.1 billion investments for the municipal infrastructure component. It will have a major economic impact throughout Québec, with nearly 60,000 jobs created or maintained on average per year. 
The PQI also marks a turn in the way of investing and managing public infrastructure. This new way of doing things will make it possible to evaluate the needs, according to the priorities of Quebecers, to measure the costs associated with it and to make informed choices.
