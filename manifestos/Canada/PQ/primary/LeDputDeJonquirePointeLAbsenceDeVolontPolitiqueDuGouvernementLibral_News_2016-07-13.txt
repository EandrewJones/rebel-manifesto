Jonquière, July 13, 2016 - The member for Jonquière and Leader of the Official Opposition, Sylvain Gaudreault, reminds the population and the Quebec government that the Graphic Packaging factory has closed wildly a year ago today . 
This company had acquired the old Cascades Cartonie in December 2014, and then closed seven months later. Since then, the Liberal government has never shown clear political will to revive the facilities. 
"It's sad to highlight the first anniversary of the closure of this factory, which had developed a new process that was envying many companies. Once again, the Liberal government has allowed an innovative product and hundreds of direct and indirect jobs in our region, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
"The government's leasy-making has led Graphic Packaging to sell the facilities to a ferrum that liquids the equipment suddenly. I still believe that the site of the cardboard has an extraordinary potential for an innovative project and job creator. I continue to offer my support to workers in this direction, as long as the facilities are not completely demolished, "concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
