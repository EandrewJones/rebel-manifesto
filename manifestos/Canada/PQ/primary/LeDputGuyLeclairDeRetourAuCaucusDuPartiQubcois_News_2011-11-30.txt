Quebec - Member of Charlevoix and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pauline Marois, announces that the member for Beauharnois, Guy Leclair, will return to the Caucus of the Parti Québécois. "We had a frank discussion and I'm satisfied. He will return to the caucus from Thursday, "she said. 
"I did not believe that to entrust some thoughts to a journalist on the sight and enough of all could do a news of this magnitude. I regret. I have never had a hidden agenda and in this sense, I am very disappointed with the path of my ex-colleague Daniel Ratthaé, "said the member for Beauharnois. 
"I reiterate my caucus, the only one I belong and have never intended to leave. I come back with enthusiasm. My leader recognizes in me a member who has convictions and my only goal is to advance Quebec and the cause of sovereignty. In this sense, I will always speak, as I have always done, in the appropriate and agreed forums, in the greatest transparency and franchise towards my chef. The electors and electors of the district of Beauharnois and Mrs. Marois will always be able to count on my dedication, "said Guy Leclair.
