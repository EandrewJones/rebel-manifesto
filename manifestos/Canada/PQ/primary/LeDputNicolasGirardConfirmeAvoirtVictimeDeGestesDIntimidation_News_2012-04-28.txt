Quebec- The hon. Member for Gouin, Nicolas Girard, confirms having been the victim of intimidation. 
Wednesday last night, around 9 pm, one or more individuals tried to intimidate the member. Using a concrete block, its private residence in Montreal was shattered. The residence was unoccupied. After checks, no object was stolen and no other similar gestures were perpetrated in the sector. 
Depending on the procedure, the member contacted the police and the security department of the National Assembly. 
This is the second time that Nicolas Girard receives threats, different forms, over the last two years. The first time goes back in 2010 while the member revealed the scandal of liberal daycares. 
The member will not make any comments.
