Québec-The member of Verchères, Stéphane Bergeron, refutes and is indignant to the daily interpretation the duty of a message of appeal to the unity of progressive and sovereignist troops behind the Quebecois party. The journalist has rather traveled in divisional germ. In addition, the article suggests that the member believes that the events that took place in recent weeks would make Chef Pauline Marois unfit in the circumstances. 
"It's delirium! The term unfit comes from the journalist, not me. Contrary to what the journalist suggests, I think Pauline Marois has the will, the courage and the determination necessary to lead the Parti Québécois. She is the person we need to establish a relationship of trust with Quebeckers, offering them a reliable and honest and above all, carry out the sovereignist project, "said Stéphane Bergeron. 
"By the way, I'm far from throwing the towel! Despite the events that shook our party, I intend to fight alongside Pauline Marois and all of my colleagues from the Caucus of the Parti Québécois to continue our rigorous work to regain the confidence of Quebeckers and re-engage Quebec on the path of full emancipation, "concluded Mr. Bergeron.
