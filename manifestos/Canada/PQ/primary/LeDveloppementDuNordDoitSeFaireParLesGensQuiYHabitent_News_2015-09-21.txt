Qu√©bec- Following the inauguration, today, the offices of the society of the North Plan in Roberval by the Prime Minister, the member for Duplessis and spokesman for the Parti Quebec's Nordic Development, Lorraine Richard, denounces The slow implantation of the society of the Northern Plan society on the Nordic territory. 
"While the slowdown in mining activities leads to heavy consequences in the territory of the North Plan, workers, businesses and communities are left to themselves. The establishment of the society's antennas of the North Plan is waiting, the mines close, the job losses multiply. Where is the positive impact of the North Plan of Philippe Couillard? Where are the jobs promised? "Said Lorraine Richard. 
"He is disconcerting that the Prime Minister puts all his efforts in the only antenna outside the territory of the North Plan. Is it the priority of the government, for the simple reason that it is in the riding of the Prime Minister? The question is valid. If the government was sincere in its desire to develop the economy of the Nordic communities, it should start with offices north of the 49th parallel. I will always maintain that northern development must be done first and foremost by people who live there, "concluded Lorraine Richard.
