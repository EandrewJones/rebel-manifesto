Quebec- The Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Agnès Maltais, is pleased with the Staff Regulations Council initiative which, in his opinion published today, identifies the profits and opportunities, but also several important issues related to the realities and needs of women in the development of the Nordic territories. The Council wishes to see women, including those from Aboriginal communities, participate more on consultations and decision-making on Nordic development issues, a goal shared by the minister. 
"It is clear that a thorough analysis of this notice must be made so that we can, as a government and as a society, follow up on this call of the Council. I invite the departments, organizations, businesses and actors from all walks of time to look after ways to contribute to the implementation of these recommendations, "said Agnès Maltais. 
"Quebec's economic development must benefit everyone and avoid accentuating inequalities. Discrimination on construction sites must cease and our government is currently studying avenues to stop this phenomenon, "the minister concluded. 
Finally, like the Council, Mrs Maltais is concerned about the increase in sexual violence in the North Territories and considers it important to make every effort to counter this phenomenon. 
Remember that this discussion paper, divided into four chapters, looks at different themes related to the situation of women, including labor requirements, traditionally male trades, training, housing and the place of women in the middle of construction and in the instances.
