As a result of the decision of the Energy Régie which confirms the doubts that already surrounded the unused Bécancour thermal power station, the member for Sanguinet and spokesman for the Parti Energy and Natural Resources Party , Alain Therrien, asks the Government to bring Hydro-Québec to order and explain what justified the conclusion of an agreement of OTC with TransCanada. 
"In his decision, the Régie confirms that Hydro-Québec could have gone to tender to ensure that you get the best possible agreement for the energy it says they need. By not doing so, Hydro-Québec goes against its obligations for the good management of public funds. The government must bring Hydro-Québec back to order; A tendering process must be launched for Quebeckers to get the best possible agreement, "said Alain Therien. 
"The agreement entered into last year between the Liberal and TransCanada government to prolong the Bécancour Thermal Generating Station for 20 years has never been explained in a transparent manner to the population and parliamentarians. Despite our repeated requests, this agreement has never been made public. Last month, it was also learned that the cost to reactivate the plant was from $ 45 to $ 75 million, an increase of 67% before the work started! ", he added. 
"While Hydro-Québec pay tens of millions of dollars into a project that did not even have passed the Energy Régie test, Bécancour citizens are the costs of the absence of the government's economic strategy. . Since the return to the power of the Liberals in 2014, abandoned or delayed projects are multiplying: Stolt Lngaz, IFFCO Canada, rare minerals Quest ... Quebec needs job creation and the government does nothing to improve this unacceptable situation, " concluded the hon. Member for Sanguinet.
