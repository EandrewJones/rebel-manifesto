Quebec- The member for Terrebonne and official opposition on the family, Mathieu Traversy, finds that the Liberals break the promise to Quebec families regarding the indexation of child care rates. 
"We discover that there is a truth before and another after the elections. The Liberal government shows us that its promises had a life of three months, that is to say until the next budget, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
Indeed, the Liberal Party had made the commitment on March 18, in the election campaign, to cancel the rise in child care rates and to index "starting in 2015". However, the Minister of the Family, Francine Charbonneau, confirmed today that the indexation of the tariffs would be for the next budget only. 
"The masks fall. While he advocates the virtues of the transparent government, the Prime Minister denies the commitment he took to Quebec's parents. The Liberal Party improvises in the management of the child care network. The government entrusts decision-making to commissions and ghost committees, instead of taking responsibility and clearly affirm what its intentions are, "added Mathieu Traversy. 
Remember that the government of the Parti Québécois had been transparent with Quebec families, announcing a gradual increase in tariffs and making available to the network. This solution, which it had highlighted to ensure the development and sustainability of the network, was consensus within the middle population and representatives. 
"In two weeks, this government has succeeded in the concern among familieset to liberate the child care network against its proposals. The uncertainty always places on the development of places after this year. These places are impatiently expected, not only by parents, but also by CPEs and subsidized daycares. Will the minister defend families and make sure they will not pay for austerity advocated by his government? ", Concluded the official opposition spokesperson.
