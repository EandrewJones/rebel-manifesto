Quebec- The member for Marie-Victorin and the official opposition for the Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Bernard Drainville, questions the reasons of the Liberal government hiding studies on federalism. 
In the last six years, the Liberal government of Jean Charest has commissioned a dozen studies on federalism. Cost of the invoice for Qu√©bec taxpayers: $ 153,000. "When studies are paid by taxpayers, the least thing is that they are made public. Why does the Liberal government keep them secret? In question Bernard Drainville. 
In 2008, the Liberal government ordered unmeameal on the future of Quebec in the Canadian Federation. This memorate has aroused some interest since it was the subject of a decision by the Board of Access to Information in January 2010. At the request of the Minister of Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, this brief remained secret. "What does this memory contain that is not montable? The question is legitimate, "said Bernard Drainville. 
The hon. Member for Marie-Victorin noted that the multiplication of federalism studies, commanded by the Charest government, also coincides with the arrival of the Harper government in 2006. "The Liberal government has focused on the Council of the Federation which has Old more than $ 5 million to Quebec taxpayers so far. As if it were not enough, it has, in parallel, spent other thousand dollars for secret studies. It's a lot of money for such a mediocre result and to see a prime minister fold so often and so easily knee to the federal government. Jean Charest seems to forget that he is the Prime Minister of Quebec, not that of Canada, "concluded Bernard Drainville.
