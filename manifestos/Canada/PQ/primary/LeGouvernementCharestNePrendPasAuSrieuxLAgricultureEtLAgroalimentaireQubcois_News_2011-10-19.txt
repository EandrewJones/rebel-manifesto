Québec - "By pushing back in 2012 consultations on the Green Paper for a bioalimentary policy, the Charest government makes fun of farmers and again confirms that it does not take seriously the future of the agri-food sector.". 
This is what the hon. Member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata and sentence of the official opposition in agriculture and food, André Simard, surprised that the government delays the adoption of a bioalimentary policy. 
The hon. Member stresses that the Charest government has been promising an agricultural policy, as a result of the tabling of the impressive report of the Pronovost Commission. "The Charest government consults, turns in circles, tablet reports. Meanwhile, agricultural enterprises are dying. It's dramatic, "continued the member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata. 
André Simard fears that the presence of the current Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Corbeil, numbers even more in the agricultural world. "Mr. Corbeil has abandoned the forest sector when he occupied this chair and we know the effects today: the regions are experiencing great dramas. To wonder if he did not receive the same order of his prime minister, "he added. 
"The time is serious for agricultural producers. Many might not survive if nothing happens. Quebec needs a real vision for this sector. The solutions exist, it lacks only the political will. At the Québécois party, we have concrete solutions to help our farmers and to restore its nobility to this major economic sector for Quebec and its regions, "concluded André Simard.
