Quebec, on March 10, 2017- The Quebec Party spokesman for Quebec-Canada, Nicolas Marceau, deplored the fact that the Quebec government has completely failed in its negotiation with the federal government and finally signed An important decline for Quebec in terms of health transfers. 
"It is sad to see the Quebec government accepting virtually twice as low growth in health transfers, solely to maintain what already existed, that is, the lack of accountability in connection With punctual amounts already announced several weeks ago by the federal government. In short, "instead of retreating on two fronts, we retreated on a single forehead"; This is what the Couillard has announced today with obvious discomfort. This demonstrates, once again, the failure of the federalism of collaboration and complacency of the Prime Minister as well as the disability of the Liberal government to defend the interests of Quebec, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
It should be remembered that over the last 12 years, federal health transfers have grown by 6% annually. Nevertheless, this proved insufficient to keep the federal share of funding for health care. Then, the Conservative government announced that at the end of the Agreement with Quebec and the provinces, in force since 2014, the growth of the Canadian Transfer for Health would be lowered by 6% to 3% per year. This decision will make the share of funding provided by Ottawa from 50%, while it was originally 50%. 
"This unilateral revision of health transfers will result in losses of about $ 6.5 billion over 10 years for Quebec, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer in Ottawa. Justin Trudeau got into her face to the Conservatives, but today he imposes the same cup in Quebec, with the blessing of Philippe Couillard and his Government, "concluded Nicolas Marceau.
