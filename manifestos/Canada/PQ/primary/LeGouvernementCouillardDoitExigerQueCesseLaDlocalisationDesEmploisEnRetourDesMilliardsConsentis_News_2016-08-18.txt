Quebec, August 18, 2016 -The member for Sanguinet and spokesman for the Québécois party in the area of economics, energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, wonders why the Couillard Government does nothing to force Bombardier to maintain Jobs in Quebec. 
"Given the financial assistance that the company has received, it would be the least of things. In addition, the current situation, in addition to being very disturbing, illustrates very well that the agreement entered into between the Liberal government and Bombardier had absolutely no guarantee as to maintain jobs in Quebec, "summarized the member. 
The government watches a train built abroad  "The relocation to Mexico of aircraft manufacturing activities results in the loss of several jobs in Quebec. Since last April, at least 92 positions have gone from the Saint Laurent plant to Mexico. When will the government wake up? "Took over Alain Therrien. 
Recalling that Quebeckers have collectively invested $ 1 billion in the company, the spokesperson invites the government to use this leverage to prevent relocations. "Philippe Couillard has hired Quebeckers' money in a bad deal and, in addition, he does not even try to take advantage of our units to keep jobs in Quebec. How soft! He also added. 
Bad economic news is accumulating  As if the case of Bombardier was not enough, we also learn that Desjardins lowered its growth forecasts for 2016 in Quebec. "The Liberals have no idea, no strategy to stimulate the Quebec economy. They do not know how to do. Worse, it does not even interest the Prime Minister. Growth is anemic; Statistics Canada confirms that Quebec has lost 19,500 full-time jobs in July. At the moment, in Quebec, there are fewer jobs at the end of 2015. It is more than time than the economic inaction of the Liberal Party ceases, "concluded Alain Therien.
