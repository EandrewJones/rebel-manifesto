Quebec- The member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesperson for the official in-house opposition, Carole Poirier, and the member for Rosemont and spokesperson for social services, Jean? François Lisé, ask the government to respect the commitments that have already been taken for social housing and the fight against homelessness. 
"The environment is worried about the silence of the Couillard government and its lack of commitment to the development of community housing. Units for people with homelessness and families, announced by the Parti Québécois as part of the national roaming policy, must materialize. The Couillard government has a duty to give the time just thousands of people waiting for them. While cutting cuts in social programs, we join our voice to all those who claim clear responses from the Liberals, "said Carole Poirier. 
The national approach to homelessness, presented last February by the Government of the Parti Québécois, contains several guidelines with an ambitious, comprehensive, coherent and sustainable vision in order to prevent and counter homelessness. 
"The Liberals did not say anything about the fight against roaming in the election campaign and, since their arrival, the radio silence continues. In anticipation of the budget and the filing of an interdepartmental plan of action, the Liberal government must indicate that it will be at the rendezvous. It is obliged to make clear commitments to fight against homelessness, "said Jean? François Lisée. 
It should be remembered that earlier this week, the official opposition arrested the Couillard government about the funding of the overall mission of community health and social services organizations, but received no response to its questions. 
"It is unacceptable that the most vulnerable people in our society make the austerity fees advocated by the Couillard government. Community media, homelessness and social housing must obtain answers, "concluded members.
