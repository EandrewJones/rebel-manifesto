Québec-After maintaining the blur on the issue of the sale of Hydro-Québec, the Liberal government has finally heard reason and has flown-face. The Prime Minister has indeed confirmed that there will be no sale of assets from his government. 
"The questions we asked forced the Prime Minister to take a position against the privatization of Hydro-Québec. After advocating a government of transparency, the Liberals seem rather to maintain indecision and confusion on important issues for Quebecers. We repeated it, this privatization was a bad idea. Hydro-Québec is a symbol of our economic nationalism. It is a source of enrichment, it is a driver of economic development for the regions, "said the member for Marie-Victorin and spokesperson for the official opposition in terms of energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville. 
This political balloon had been launched as a result of the publication of experts on the state of public finances of Quebec, produced by economists Luc Godbout and Claude Montaguquette, offering the privatization of the Crown corporation as a solution to the budget problem . Since then, the Prime Minister had not closed the door to this eventuality, declaring even wanting to submit the issue to his future tax committees and the revision of the programs. 
"Asked yesterday on the possibility of selling some of the assets of Hydro-Québec, the President of the Treasury Board, Martin Coiteous, had said that everything was on the table. The Prime Minister was obliged today to bring him back to order, finally rejecting this bad proposal. We must constantly return to the charge to get answers. Quebecers have the right to know what awaits them and what are the plans of this government, "concluded the member for Marie-Victorin.
