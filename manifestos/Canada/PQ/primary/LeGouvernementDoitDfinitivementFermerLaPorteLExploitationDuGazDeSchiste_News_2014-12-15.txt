Québec- Following the publication of the report of the Office of Public Hearings on the Environment (BAPE) about the exploitation of shale gas, the member for Jonquière and spokesman for the official opposition in respect of Sustainable Development and Environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, as well as the member for Marie-Victorin and Spokesperson for Energy and Natural Resources, Bernard Drainville, consider that the Liberal government must now finalize the door. 
"The BAPE report clearly indicates that shale gas exploitation would not be beneficial for Quebec. It would also have many environmental impacts, including deterioration of air quality, noise and road traffic, in addition to the risks for the quality of surface and underground water. In addition, the shale gas industry would increase greenhouse gas emissions from 3% to 23%. The Minister of the Environment must now clearly indicate that his government will refuse any exploration or exploitation of shale gas in Quebec, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
The report also notes that, according to the "cost-cost" analysis of the strategic environmental assessment, prior to that of BAPE, the natural gas prices projected by the Energy Information Administration of the United States would not make it possible to ensure The profitability of shale gas exploitation in Quebec. Overall, this analysis overestimates the benefits of Quebec in the event of shale gas exploitation. 
The government must finally listen to the population 
For its part, the member for Marie-Victorin recalls that the Liberal government seeks to resurrect the shale gas industry by setting up a strategic environmental assessment "on all hydrocarbons". 
"The government has already worried enough to worry among the population of the St. Lawrence Valley. Beyond the important environmental risks, the BAPE report indicates that the perceived economic benefits would not be at the rendezvous. It also mentions that social acceptability would not be acquired. For us, the answer is clear: shale gas would move away from our goal of reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Liberals must finally listen to the people and say no to shale gas, "concluded Bernard Drainville.
