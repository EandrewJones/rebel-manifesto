Quebec- The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on SME and Innovation, André Villeneuve, asks Minister Carlos Leitão to give up the 47.5% tax increase that will be inflicted on very small SMEs from the 1st January 2017. 
"This tax increase was hidden in the March 2015 budget! The Parti Québécois voted against this measure. We also sent a written answer to entrepreneurs who had sent us a letter-petition during the month of February to denounce this injustice, "said the member. 
Here is the answer of the Parti Québécois: 
"The Quebec economy has been stagnating since April 2014. Growth is down in terms of forecasts, job losses are multiplying, and private investments are neutral. 
Our economy would normally have to take advantage of two phenomena that advantage: the fall of the Canadian dollar and the price of oil. However, it is not. 
Despite these alarming findings, the Liberal government has decided to raise taxes for small SMEs from 1 January 2017. This increase will reach $ 200 million in 2018-2019. We believe that Quebec and our businesses do not need this new tax, which aims for the smallest of our SMEs and will brake their growth. 
You can count on us to denounce the government's unjust and foolish rise in your taxes, in this particularly difficult economic period. » 
"The government should file an economic development strategy to grow its income instead of increasing the taxes of SMEs. Our SMEs constitute the real economic lung of Quebec; Let's give them a little oxygen! ", Concluded André Villeneuve.
