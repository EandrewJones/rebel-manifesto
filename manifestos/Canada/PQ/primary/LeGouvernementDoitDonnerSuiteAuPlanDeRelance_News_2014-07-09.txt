Quebec, July 9, 2014 -The MP for Saint-Jérôme and official opposition spokesperson for economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, was disappointed with the measures Planned by the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, François Blais, as a result of the announcement of the closure of the Electrolux factory of the Assumption. 
The announcement of the Minister of Employment is far from attacking the substantive problem that affects the MRC of the Assumption. "This measure is insufficient. After four years of hard work to revive the economy of the region, the citizens of the MRC are entitled to expect much more than a pilot project as limited. The government must continue the work started, listening and support the recovery plan proposed by the environmental actors, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
It should be remembered that in May 2013, the Marois government supported the stimulus plan and supported the studies necessary for the deployment of several measures suggested by the middle actors. 
For Dave Turcotte, MP for Saint-Jean and official opposition spokesperson for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, the $ 17 million cuts in aid measures to the Employment, announced by Minister Blais during the study of budget appropriations, will not contribute to resolving the situation. 
"Workers over the age of 50 and all those affected by factory closures must be able to count on comprehensive services by local employment centers and all employability stakeholders, throughout Quebec. Let's hope that the cuts will not affect the programs in the Lanaudière or elsewhere in Quebec, "worked by the member for Saint John.
