Quebec, May 3, 2016 - The member for Bourget and spokesman of the Quebecois Party responsible for the Charter of the French Language, Maka Kotto, believes that the ad today the Liberal government on language of Display, it's "too little, too late". 
"The announcements of the Minister responsible for the Charter of the French language do not go far enough and are very late. The judgment of the Court of Appeal on the Language of Poster has intervened a year ago, and the recommendations were very clear: if we want to guarantee the commercial display in French, it must be legislated. Without a change to Law 101, disputes of the Regulation will always be possible, and its application will remain subject to the goodwill of companies. A definitive solution must be made by integrating the law of new requirements, "said Maka Kotto. 
"Our language and our culture must be of the priorities of all the moments for the Government of Quebec. Now, French is under pressure, and this, in several areas. The situation of workers on ephemeral projects, such as Chum, or the francization of newcomers, which is very inconvenient, are only two examples among so many others. All recent studies also demonstrate a decline in French as a language of work, especially in Montreal. The Charter must be adapted to answer this new reality, "continued the member for Bourget. 
Remember that the Parti Québécois - in particular through Bill 14, tabled under the Government of Pauline Marois - has long proposed to strengthen the Charter of the French language, including including companies from 26 to 49 employees and the Federal Charter companies. "The government must do more, act with more vigor and determination. Currently, the boat takes the water of all banks and its proposal, by simple regulatory path, is far from sufficient to clog the breach, "concluded Maka Kotto.
