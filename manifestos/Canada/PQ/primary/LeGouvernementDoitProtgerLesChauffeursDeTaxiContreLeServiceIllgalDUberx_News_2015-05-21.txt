Quebec- The member for Vachon and sentence of the official opposition on transport, Martine Ouellet, asks the Minister of Transport, Robert PoÃ«ti, to enforce the law by ensuring that the UberX, illegal service in Quebec, ceases. 
"UberX offers a taxi-type service but, unlike taxi drivers, it does without the permit worth nearly $ 200,000, without paying taxes or taxes, and without complying with the regulations. That explains, largely, why the service is cheaper. This is unfair competition for Quebec taxi drivers; The government must protect them, "said Martine Ouellet. 
Although the Minister of Transport claims that Duberx is illegal, the service continually takes expansion in Quebec. Vehicle seizures have been made since last October, but UBERX supports judicial costs and the service continues despite everything. 
"If UberX continues to offer its service, the consequences for our drivers could be enormous: License price drop, significant loss of profit, decrease in customers. While these men and women have contracted mortgages of hundreds of thousands of dollars to practice taxi driver profession in the rules of the art, UBERX continues to offer its service illegally. Because of UberX, they may lose their jobs and retirement; This situation is unacceptable and the Minister Poeti must crack down, "concluded the hon. Member.
