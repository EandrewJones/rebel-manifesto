Quebec, on February 15, 2017- Harold Lebel, spokesperson for the Quebecois for Seniors, and Nicolas Marceau, spokesperson for finance, ask the Liberal government to hear reason and not to deprive 500,000 elders of 500 $ a year. 
"All members have had, at their constituency desk, outstanding seniors who demand that the government back, because it does not make sense to go up $ 500 more in their pockets. We have a minister responsible for seniors, Francine Charbonneau; She must wear their voices, she who knows all groups that denounce this measure. Did the minister have succeeded, in the last hours, to convince his colleague Minister of Finance, Carlos Leit√£o, to forget about this idea? Can she defend seniors? "Harold Lebel wonders. 
"The truth is that there have been people who have long planned their retirement, taking into account these $ 500 to which they will no longer be eligible under the changes introduced in the budget by the Minister of Finance. It is he who has changed the rules of the game, without warning. And there are people who, from today, will take $ 500 a year for 5 years. That's the liberal plan for seniors, "added Nicolas Marceau. 
"Remove $ 500 a year for 5 years to the most vulnerable people, that's what the Liberal government wants to do. This is unacceptable! Especially during this time, he continues to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to doctors. The least we can say is that he does not have the priorities to the right places, "have concluded members.
