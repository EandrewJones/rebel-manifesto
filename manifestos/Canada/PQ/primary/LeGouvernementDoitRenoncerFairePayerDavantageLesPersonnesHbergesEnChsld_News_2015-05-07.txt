Quebec- The hon. Member for Richelieu and the official opposition spokesman for seniors, Sylvain Rochon, and the member for Taillon and spokesperson for health and accessibility to care, Diane Lamarre, ask the Minister of the Health and Social Services, Gaétan Barrette, to give up to impose housing in CHSLD an increase in the tariff goes beyond indexation. 
"While our seniors are struggling to get a bath a week and quality meals in public hosting centers, it is learned that the Minister of Health will charge them more for the same services, for the same accommodation. He must give up this idea and work, rather, to enhance the care and services of which our elders need it so much. But the minister and his government made a choice: to ask for more money to vulnerable people and seniors hosted in CHSLD, "said Sylvain Rochon. 
"It is as a result of questions that we asked him during the study of budget appropriations, Tuesday, that the Minister of Health had to admit that an error had slipped into the documents given to parliamentarians concerning the Support program for the autonomy of the elderly. Indeed, Gaétan Barrette confirmed that the 2015-2016 budget includes a measure aimed at scalating the contribution of people hosted into CHSLD beyond inflation. Yet, we have not heard of marking it when filing the budget. The 37,000 affected people are mainly people over 65 or heavily disabled. The minister does not guarantee them essential services for hygiene and diet, but it is ready to go for additional millions in their pockets. I notice, day after day, how much this minister is of the population and insensitive to the problems that affect it everyday, "added Diane Lamarre.
