Quebec- The member for Marie-Victorin and the official opposition on energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, asks the Government to establish a new schedule for oil exploration on the island of Anticosti, so Quebeckers can know the potential to be able to decide what they want to do. 
At the Parliamentary Committee on Bill 28, it has been learned that the 2014 Exploration Program on Anticosti has not been respected. The government has allowed a doubt about the project before the last election and has not provided the necessary support for the achievement of the objectives of the program, so that the project has already taken a year late. 
"By cutting the exploration tax credits by 20%, the Liberal government fleeing investors. It must stop the uncertainty that surrounds the project and define a new schedule for Anticosti. Quebeckers have the right to know the oil potential of the island; They will then be able to decide what they want to do, "said Bernard Drainville. 
Actions to resume our rights 
Remember that the government of the Parti Québécois has recovered the rights of Quebeckers on the territory of anticosti, which had been sold for a bite of bread by the Liberal government of Jean Charest. 
The exploratory stage consisted of validating the commercial potential. To this end, work was to be carried out in the summer of 2014, to allow the government to make informed decisions about the following, including the process of analyzing environmental impacts. 
Philippe Couillard does nothing for the riches of Quebecers 
"After his arrival in power, the Liberal government has put anticosti and shale gas in the same boat. However, a government that has such a miserable economic record does not have the means to deprive Quebeckers of their right to know if there is an oil potential on the island of Anticosti, "added the member for Marie- Victorin.
