Quebec- The member of the Madeleine Islands and Parliamentary Assistant of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ms. Jeannine Richard, announced, on behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr. François GENDRON, a special financial assistance to support the flotilla of lobsteries in Quebec. 
For more than five years, the lobster fishing industry has been struggling with significant difficulties due to the low prices offered in the markets. This year, although landed quantities remained stable in the Madeleine Islands and increased in Gaspésia, market prices have declined further. 
"The decline in prices offered, combined with the widespread increase in operating expenses, weakens our lobster fisheries companies. This industry is very important for the eastern economy of Quebec and this special help will be beneficial to allow certain financially vulnerable companies to blow a little, "said Francois Gendron. 
Special financial assistance includes a relief of the payments of the capital on the loans guaranteed by the department and a grant in the form of a reimbursement of bait and fuel costs of companies, which could reach $ 5,000 per company. 
"With the season the lobster experiences this year, this very awaited help will be welcome. Lobster fishery is a major industry for us and our government grants it all the importance it deserves by setting up a special assistance measure, "said Jeannine Richard, reminiscent of the passage of 500 lobster fishermen in Quebec and that the value of landings was estimated at more than $ 36 million in 2012.
