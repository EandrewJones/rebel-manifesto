Quebec- Minister Delegate for Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Canadian Francophonie and Sovereignist Governance, Mr. Alexandre Cloutier, denounces the federal intention to unilaterally modify the provisions of Laloi on the Supreme Court concern the appointment of the three judges of this Court that must come from Quebec. 
"After the Senate and the attack on law 99, now the federal government is the right to change without consultation with the provisions that are at the heart of a specific asymmetry in Quebec and which reflect its distinct character", Declared Minister Cloutier. 
"Everyone knows that Quebec has always claims to be a stakeholder in the process of appointing judges to the Supreme Court. Today, the federal government is unilaterally acting in amending Laloi on the Supreme Court, thus affecting the Appointment Process of Quebec Judges, "said Minister Cloutier 
"If the federal government thinks it is useful by addressing the Supreme Court, it would at least be able to have the CRAN to ask the question of bilingualism of its judges," he added. 
For its part, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Bertrand St-Arnaud, announces that he will intervene with the Supreme Court of Canada as part of the referral on the appointment of Judge Marc Nadon. 
The Government will argue that the appointment of Judge Nadon does not comply with the provisions of the Act that at least three judges of the Court are appointed among the judges of the Superior Court or the Court of Appeal of Quebec or among the Quebec Court of Appeal. members of the Barreau du Qu√©bec. It will also argue that the Federal Parliament can not legislate unilaterally in order to modify Laloi on the Supreme Court, as proposed.
