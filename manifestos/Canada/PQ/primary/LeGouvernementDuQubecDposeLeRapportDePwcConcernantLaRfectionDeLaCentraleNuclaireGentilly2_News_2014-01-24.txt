Quebec- The Minister of Natural Resources, Mrs. Martine Ouellet, made public, following the limited Hydro-Québec and Atomic Energy Regulations, the PricewaterhouseCoopers report (PWC) regarding the repair of the Gentilly-2 nuclear power plant. 
The mandate of PwC was to carry out an audit relating to the suspension of the repair work of the Gentilly-2 power station by Hydro-Québec since the accounting firms had ruled that it was out of their scope of competence To check the "actions of the former Government and Hydro-Québec" in the absence of objective criteria on which to be based. 
Costs capitalized for investment for the rehabilitation of the Gentilly-2 plant, for the years closed December 31, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008, totaled $ 988 million. During its review, PWC has not identified it to believe that the statement of costs recognized as investment for the rehabilitation of the Gentilly-2 plant is not in conformity, in all its significant aspects, generally accepted accounting principles of Canada. 
The report is accessible to the following address: http: //www.mrn.gouv.qc.ca/publications/renergy/gentilly2/rapport_mission_examen_gentilly2.pdf
