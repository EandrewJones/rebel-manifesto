Davos- The Prime Minister of Quebec, Pauline Marois, announces today the expansion of the studio of Ubisoft Entertainment Inc. in Quebec. The expansion of this studio will allow the creation of 100 jobs. The Quebec government has given a non-refundable financial contribution of $ 510,000 to Ubisoft Entertainment Inc. for the completion of this project of $ 28.7 million over three years. 
"The obsession of my government since its election is to create quality jobs in all regions. In recent years, Quebec has become a global pole in video game development, with nearly 90 studios and about 8300 jobs. Our competitive business environment, our qualified and creative workplace, our strategic infrastructures, such as specialized training centers and lower operating costs than elsewhere, are all benefits for companies that are established at home. We are proud to participate in the growth of a strategic sector for our economy, "said the Prime Minister. 
The Ubisoft project will allow the Qu√©bec Studio to have a state-of-the-art infrastructure and an environment conducive to creating new generation consoles. The video game domain is currently crossing a transition period with the multiplication of platforms, the arrival of digital distribution as well as the increased importance of social networks and connectivity. To adapt to this new reality, game studios need to review their production modes. 
"With our investment and help from the government, our Quebec Studio will become an AAA class studio. We continue to build the expertise that allows us to create the best games in the industry, "said Yves Guillemot, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Ubisoft.
