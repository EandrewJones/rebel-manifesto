"In the current context of energy surplus, Hydro-Québec will save $ 24 million each year thanks to this decision. It is therefore all Quebeckers who will be winners by avoiding significant losses, "said Mrs. Martine Ouellet. 
The end of this program will result in the abandonment of six projects of small hydroelectric power plants whose stages of realization are at a preliminary stage. "The Government will quickly begin discussions with the promoters concerned to determine the appropriate compensation based on the progress of the projects and expenses carried out", "said Ouellet.

"As a new government, we have a duty to manage the transition. In addition to obvious economic considerations, we also decided in favor of preserving several natural environments without renouncing a desire for regional development. Our energy future involves this convergence between the economy and the environment from a sustainable development perspective, "concluded the Minister of Sustainable Development, the Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet.
