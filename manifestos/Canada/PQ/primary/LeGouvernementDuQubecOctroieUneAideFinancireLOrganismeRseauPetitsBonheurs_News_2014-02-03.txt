Montreal - On behalf of the Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Carole Poirier, announces the award of $ 75,000 financial assistance to the Network Bianmers, for his project aimed at developing its networking component. 
"Since its inception, the small happiness network offers culture as a means of social integration and development of young children through the exploration of the world of creation. The spectacles for toddlers are of a particular character because, by feeding their imagination, they feed their creativity and develop their taste to frequent the arts, "said Maka Kotto. 
"By observing the illuminated look of all young spectators, it is understood that it is essential to increase the supply of cultural activities specific to early childhood. With the heart of multiplying opportunities to make the performing arts accessible to young people from economically fragile environments, the network small happiness tests where it counts, "said Carole Poirier. 
The network currently has 15 members in some regions of Quebec, among the multidisciplinary and specialized broadcasters in performances and artistic benefits for early childhood. The objective of the organization is to develop its networking component in order to promote its expansion across Quebec, to reach more toddlers in small or not currently served areas, including fragile economic circles. 
The $ 75,000 financial assistance announced by the Ministry of Culture and Communications will give a second wind to the organization by promoting the deployment of cultural activities and the public's access to them.
