Quebec- The minister responsible for democratic institutions and citizen participation, Bernard Drainville, presented today to the National Assembly Bill 3, An Act to amend the electoral law in order to provide for fixed date elections such as was engaged the Quebecois party at the last campaign. 
"If this bill is adopted, it will no longer be possible to trigger elections for partisan purposes at a time deemed appropriate by the ruling party. In fact, all parties will be on an equal footing at the starting line, "said the minister. 
Bill 3 provides that the next general elections will be held on September 26, 2016 and that subsequent elections will take place on the last September Monday of the fourth calendar year following the last general elections. 
The establishment of fixed date elections will make it possible to establish rules of the game more equitable for all political parties and will promote the electoral participation of certain groups of citizens such as young people and the elderly. 
The Minister argued that the establishment of fixed date elections will facilitate the planning and organization of the electoral process for parties, for candidates as well as for the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec (DGEQ). Mr. Drainville recalled that, according to the DGEQ, fixed date elections will generate savings of more than $ 2 million. In Ontario, the introduction of fixed date elections gave rise to savings of more than $ 7 million. 
"It is in the interest of the citizen, the taxpayer and the elector to improve the functioning of the electoral system. The fixed date elections that enroll in our desire to give more power to citizens and modernize Quebec democracy. That's what our government applies, "concluded the minister, who relies on the collaboration of all parties for the bill to be adopted as soon as possible.
