Quebec- The Government of Quebec makes public the report of forecasting following the investigation made from the year 2013 by the FIRME KPMG, at the request of the Ministry of Finance and the Economy, concerning the Levinoff slaughterhouse Colbex. 
"This report highlights a fact: the blindness of the Liberal government will be expensive to Quebec taxpayers and agricultural producers. Millions of dollars have been engulfed in this FIASCO because the previous government has not acted diligently, preferring to close the eyes, while our producers were in a vulnerability situation, "concluded the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister Agriculture, fisheries and food, Mr. Fran√ßois Gendron.
