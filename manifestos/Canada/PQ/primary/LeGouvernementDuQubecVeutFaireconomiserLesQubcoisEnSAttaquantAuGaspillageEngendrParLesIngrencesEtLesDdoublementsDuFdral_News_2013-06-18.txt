Quebec - Minister Delegate for Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Canadian Francophonie and Sovereignist Governance, Alexandre Cloutier, the Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Elders, Mr. Réjean Hébert, the Minister Delegate to Services and to the protection of youth, Ms. Véronique Hivon, and the Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the Territory, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault are committed to saving Quebeckers by tackling at Waspillage generated by the interference and duplication of Ottawa in the exclusive skills of Quebec. To do this, the Quebec government has four experts in the field of municipal affairs as well as health and social services. 
"More than ever, the Quebec government faces the federal government's disordered interventions in the exclusive skills of Quebec. It is clear that the federal government is pursuing the same paternalistic federalism that it strongly condemned in the Quebec City speech in 2005. After recovering from the public finances of Quebec, we are now attacking duplication. And at Ottawa's interference, to make the state more effective and save Quebeckers. We want to ensure that they stop paying duplicate for services that are the sole responsibility of the Government of Quebec, "said Minister Alexandre Cloutier.
