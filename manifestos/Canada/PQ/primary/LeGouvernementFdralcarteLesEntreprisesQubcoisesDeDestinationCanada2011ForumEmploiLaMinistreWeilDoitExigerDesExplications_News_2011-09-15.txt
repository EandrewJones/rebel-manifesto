"While the groups follow one another in the Parliamentary Committee to insist on the importance of the immigration of skilled workers, Quebec companies are excluded by the Government of Canada because they have activities only in Quebec! It is quite commendable to support the intake of new blood in Francophone communities outside Quebec. However, in the context of a decline still confirmed by French in Quebec and especially in Montreal, this decision from Ottawa is deeply discriminatory towards Quebec and Quebec companies, "said Yves-François Blanchet. 
"Quebec must fight to attract Francophone immigrants and the federal government to cut him the grass under his foot by limiting him in his potentialities to recruit, by this forum employment also paid by the taxes and taxes of Quebecers, skilled workers, temporary and permanent, many of whom will become permanent residents and future citizens. What did the Minister of Immigration and Cultural Communities do, Kathleen Weil, to denounce this situation with his counterpart in Ottawa? The minister must immediately require and obtain explanations from the federal government! Better, it must admit that only Quebec should have immigration powers on its territory, "Blanchet concluded.
