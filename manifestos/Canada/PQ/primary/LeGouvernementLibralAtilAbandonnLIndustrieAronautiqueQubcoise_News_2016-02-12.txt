Quebec- The Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, the Word of the Parti Québécois in the field of Energy, Energy and Natural Resources, Alain Therrien, as well as the spokesperson in terms of finance and Income, Nicolas Marceau, ask the government to unveil its game plan for the aerospace industry. 
"The job losses have followed one another for two years, whether at CAE, at Bombardier or Bell Helicopter, as we have seen yesterday. What does the government do to stop this haemorrhage affecting such a neuralgic sector? ", Wanted to know the leader of the official opposition. 
With respect to value, aircraft are the main Quebec export products. "Bombardier cut 1000 positions in Montreal, CAE, 280, and now yesterday, Bell Helicopter announced the removal of 300 additional jobs. For this factory only, it's 1000 on 2000 jobs that have been lost for 5 years. The absence of a government plan ensures that the sector can not do any forecasts. What are the Liberals awaited to act? ", For his part, asked Alain Therrien. 
"The government has put all its balls in a misdeveloped Bombardier. And since that time it acts as if everything was settled, while job losses multiply, and that clergy sales are stagnating. Concern is widespread in the aerospace sector. The government is unable to reassure industry players and help them properly, "continued Nicolas Marceau. 
"Already the Prime Minister had no economic development or job creation plan, his volte-face in the Anticosti file has created a climate of economic uncertainty. Investors are afraid to come to Quebec and suffer the prime minister's mood. Quebec needs a clear vision. Where is this government? This is the question that everyone arises, "concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
