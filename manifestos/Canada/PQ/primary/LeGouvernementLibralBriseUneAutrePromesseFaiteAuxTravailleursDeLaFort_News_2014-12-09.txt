Quebec- The hon. Member for Bonaventure and Forest Opposition Spokesman, Sylvain Roy, asks the Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, Laurent Lessard, to confirm the sum of 225 million in investments for the Forest, announced in great pomp last spring by Prime Minister Philippe Couillard. 
"New day, new broken liberal promise. If it turns out, this breach of commitment will cause direct job losses in the forest areas. It is outrageous, especially since the expected increase in budgets came directly from rising royalties paid by the industry. What does the Minister Laurent Lessard wait to defend the middle of the forest? Factory closures accumulate, full-time job losses amount to more than 50,000 since April. For the first time in a long time, the Minister of Finance provides for a decline in employment in Quebec. The government must act, deploy a real economic policy, and this is through forest workers, "said Sylvain Roy. 
The hon. Member recalls that the field of the forest has been hit hard since the arrival of the Liberals; factories have indeed interrupted their production in almost all regions, including those of the North Shore, Bas-Saint-Laurent, Charlevoix, Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, of the Estrie and Mauricie. It should also be noted that the liberal record is disastrous for the forest sector: between 2003 and 2012, 20,000 direct job losses and 300 factory closures were counted. 
"The government can not even maintain existing jobs. In diverse in silvicultural work, it is the future of the Quebec forest that is jeopardized. This broken promise adds to the prime minister's board. Laurent Lessard must confirm that the amount of 225 million will be preserved, instead of allowing the concern and uncertainty about the regions, "concluded Sylvain Roy.
