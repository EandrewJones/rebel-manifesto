Quebec- The member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for ethics and integrity, Stéphane Bergeron, denounces the Liberal government, which again bought the actions of the Minister of Education, the Leisure And sport, Yves Bolduc. Liberal MPs voted against a motion asking the Minister to completely repay his $ 215,000 premium. 
The motion reads as follows: 
"That the National Assembly requires the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, which he immediately reimburses the entire $ 215,000 premium he received in addition to his compensation to the act and his Member of Parliament following his return to medical practice in September 2012. " 
"This question should be settled for several months. Minister Bolduc should have understood from the outset that the gesture he posed was unacceptable. The amount of $ 215,000 must be fully refunded. If the government wants to be credible in the austerity measures it proposes to Quebecers, the minister must set an example and repay his full premium. Transparency and integrity in the management of public funds have been abandoned this afternoon by the Liberal government, "said Stéphane Bergeron. 
"Of the 5400 physicians who have received premiums, there are only 14 who have received a bonus of more than $ 200,000 as part of this measure. And, of these 14 doctors, there is Minister Bolduc. But he said practiced the medicine at "very partial time". The purpose of this measure was to give a family doctor to people and families who did not. It was about a complete and long-term support, not simply a point support. The minister diverted the goal of the premium by collecting more than $ 215,000. He himself signed the agreement creating this premium and he knew a fault he did not hesitate to exploit, the fault that we corrected when we were in the government, "concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
