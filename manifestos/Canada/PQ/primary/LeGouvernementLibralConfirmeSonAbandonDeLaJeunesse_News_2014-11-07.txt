Quebec, November 7, 2014 - presence of dozens of young people and stakeholders involved in the spell of Youth-Emploi trap (CJE), the member for Saint-Jean and the official opposition to employment opposition , vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, has arrested today to the National Assembly, the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, François Blais, about the change of mission of the CJE . 
"Before making a final decision on this issue, the minister would have advantageous to go closely what is happening in the CJEs, says Dave Turcotte. Especially since the CJE Charlesbourg-Chauveau is in the same building as its constituency office! » 
The member emphasizes that they are not the structures that are attacked by the Liberal government; It is young people that CEPs support every day in their access to employment. "With the loss of 82,000 full-time jobs since last April, we can not afford to deprive ourselves of expertise and support for employment in our regions," he continued. 
The member also stresses that the changes made will have an impact on several young people who use the services offered by the CEPs. "With the reform of the Minister François Blais, young people under the age of 18 will no longer have access to CJEs or those who are not providers of social assistance or employment insurance. For example, young people in precarious employment and wishing to reorient their careers would not have access to CJE services. Of the 60,000 young people who are currently receiving CJE support, 40,000 will no longer be eligible; It's inconceivable! ", Concluded Dave Turcotte.
