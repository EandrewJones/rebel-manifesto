Quebec- In response to the filing of a draft regulation about the presence of French in the commercial display by the Liberal government, the member for Jonquière and Leader of the Official Opposition, Sylvain Gaudreault, offered his collaboration to the first Minister Philippe Couillard for a legislative amendment to the Charter of the French language. 
"The responsibility inherent in the role of Prime Minister of Quebec is to protect and defend the French language. Unfortunately, by his project, Philippe Couillard has chosen the decline of French. He abdicated, presenting a simple draft regulation that comes to rule that French must appear in the visual environment of the shops. Not only is this regulation fragile and could be challenged again, but it comes, in addition, devote another decline in the language file. At the Parti Québécois, we want to act at source and change the law. There is no compromise to do. I offer our collaboration to the Prime Minister to change the law 101, to strengthen the presence of French in Quebec, before the end of the session, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. The Leader of the Opposition has also recalled that the judge, in a decision on the language of display rendered in April 2015, mentions that he returns to the legislator to change the law to give a clear legal basis to the obligation to display in French. 
"The Prime Minister told us last year - and he reiterated it today - that he made the use of French" a matter of politeness ", while it is, in reality, of A question of respect for the official language of Quebec. What Quebeckers ask is a better presence of the Prime Minister for the Defense and Promotion of Our Language. The judgment is very clear: it is to the legislator to act to accentuate the presence of the French language. The Prime Minister must tell us why he does not want to strengthen Law 101 to protect and promote our language, "concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
