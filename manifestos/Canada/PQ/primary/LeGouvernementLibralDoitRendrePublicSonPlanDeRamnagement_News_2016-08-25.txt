"In April 2015, the project, estimated at about $ 500 million, was supposed to be unveiled to the public. But the population is still waiting. Today, in the news, we refer to the future of the Train station of Sainte-Foy; Will we approach each element of this great set that constitutes the head of the bridges? Have any decided yet? The questions are numerous and the population of Quebec and Lévis expects answers. Minister Blais must, for once, demonstrate leadership and meet the many expectations of citizens, "said Agnès Maltais. 
"Recently, the new Minister of Transport - the third! - met the mayor of Quebec, and we know that there was talk about this file. Can we have more details? The redevelopment of this key sector is a major importance for the capital, and the process must be transparent, "said the member for Taschereau. 
"Laurent Lessard, unfortunately, posted its usual nonchalance since its entry into operation as Minister of Transport. Imagine: it is not even embarrassed to say that it does not have an opinion on the illegal activities of UberX, and considers that a large household at the MTQ is not necessary, despite all the denunciations of Intimidation and conflict of interest, despite all the setbacks experienced by his senior executives since last spring, despite the crisis of trust. We ask him to recover and to ensure that his government quickly unveils the population and the schedule it plans to revitalize the head of the bridges ", has concluded Martine Ouellet.
