"It's time to put the cap back on the possibility of exploiting shale gas in these areas, such as anywhere in Quebec. Do not submit abandoned licenses on the market for an indefinite period costs nothing. In addition, it is much better to recover them when they are voluntarily abandoned by a company. The Liberal government must send a message, "said Jean-François Lisée. 
"We fought with all our strength, as part of the study of Bill 106, so that the government will prohibit fracturing, hated technique used to extract shale gas. He stubbornly refused, announcing a supervision in regulations that are, on that date, not yet published. He missed another great opportunity today to show that he is sensitive to the concerns of Quebecers. We will continue to be their voice, as resolutely as the government is that of oil and gas, "has Sylvain Rochon on his side.
