Quebec- The member for Terrebonne and sentence of the official opposition in family, Mathieu Traversy, sum the Minister of the Family, Francine Charbonneau, to totally abandon the idea of bringing the parents of Quebec and calls for the immediate withdrawal of Bill 27. 
"The Groups heard in parliamentary committee confirmed what we have since since the beginning: this bill is improvised and does not meet the problem of alleged places. What the government has to do is withdraw its bailed bill and quickly propose solutions to real problems, the scarcity of the places and the lack of flexibility in the offer of child care. Quebec families need accessible and flexible places, that is, part-time or atypical, evening or weekend schedule. Solutions exist; The minister must therefore go back on the sanctions she wants to impose on parents and accelerate the development of places, which she herself slows, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
In addition, the member for Terrebonne invites the Minister to reconnect with his network. "The site on the quality and durability of child care and the optimization of their funding, chaired by Maurice Boisvert and set up by the Parti Québécois government, targeted various problems with which the network is in catch. His report was filed in December 2013, but the current government did not follow up. I ask Minister Charbonne to restore dialogue with the network by creating a follow-up committee of the Boisvert report, to reflect on real solutions. She must listen to the partners in the field because they know the environment and they are willing to work to bring effective and sustainable solutions, "the member has concluded.
