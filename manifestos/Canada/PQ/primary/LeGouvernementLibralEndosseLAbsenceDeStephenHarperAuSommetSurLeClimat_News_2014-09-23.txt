Quebec- The hon. Member for Jonquière and the official opposition on the environment and sustainable development, Sylvain Gaudreault, notes that the Liberal government can not stand up to the federal government, since it refused to support A motion condemning the absence of Stephen Harper at the UN Summit on the climate. 
"In New York, Philippe Couillard refuses to comment on Stephen Harper's absence. The Liberals are unable to ensure that Quebec unanimously denounces the federal absence at a global climate change table. They do not want to criticize Ottawa; Liberal to flat-ventry continues, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
The motion rejected by the Liberals reads as follows: 
"That the National Assembly denounces the absence of the Prime Minister of Canada at the UN Summit on Climate in New York; 
That the National Assembly emphasizes the march on the climate held in about twenty Quebec cities, where thousands of citizens recalled the requirement to have economic development compatible with the protection of the environment. »
