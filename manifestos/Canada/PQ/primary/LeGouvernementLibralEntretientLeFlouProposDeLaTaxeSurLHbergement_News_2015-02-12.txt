Quebec- The member for Bertrand and official opposition spokesman, Claude Cousineau, as well as the member for Abitibi West, François Gendron, denounce the Blur that the government is about the tax on the Accommodation, while some actors in the tourism affirm that he wants to deprive the regions of the resulting budgets. 
"As if our regions were not already heavily experienced by the Prime Minister's austerity policy, we learned this morning, by the voice of the tourist actors of the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, that the government juggles with the idea of centralizing the budgets of the accommodation tax. If this is happened, we can say that the Minister of Tourism is putting fire to the powders in the industry, "said Claude Cousineau. 
The hon. Member recalls that since 1997, Regional Tourism Associations (ATR) have decided by themselves the use they make budgets from the accommodation tax. The ATRs know their environment and their stakeholders; They know how to improve the tourism offer in their area and promote it. 
"In the House this morning, the minister responsible for the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, Luc Blanchette, has not even intervened to reassure the tourist community of our home. The worries of stakeholders are understandable, since no one, among the Liberals, has denied the centralization scenario. The government needs to retreat on this harmful idea for regional tourism development, "François Gendron concluded.
