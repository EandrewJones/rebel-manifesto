Quebec- The member for Labelle and sentence of the official opposition in the matter of recreation and sports, Sylvain Pagé, and the member for Joliette and spokesperson in the field of culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, denounce the cup of Half of the funding that Loto-Québec allocates to the National Day, adding to the 20% cup of its budget by the government. 
Loto-Québec even affirmed, by the voice of its spokesman, that the National Day is not a carrier activity for the Crown corporation because it "does not have sufficient economic and tourism influence to justify the 'Injection of funds'. For the Québécois Party, this vision is reductive from the gathering scope of the Quebeckers' National Day, whose events emphasize our pride, our culture and our identity. 
"The declaration and gesture of Loto-Québec are unacceptable. We ask that the Crown corporation immediately withdraws its remarks, that it considers the fair value of the contribution of the national holiday and that it understands that our party should never be coined, "said Sylvain Pagé. 
The Parti Québécois again emphasizes the importance of the National Day for our cultural identity. "It's a hinge of the year when all Quebeckers, regardless of their origins, celebrate their membership of a joint venture. The government and Loto-Québec must return to their decision and restore the budgets for this event, "added Véronique Hivon.
