Quebec, November 5, 2014 -The member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, and the member for Terrebonne and Family Spokesperson, Mathieu Traversy, denounce the relentlessness of the Liberal government on Quebec families .

"Never have the families of Quebec have been attacked also directly. Philippe Couillard, in election campaign, denounced a tariff potential for the families of the middle class; He never talked about the family tax he now intends to impose. The Liberals then said against a $ 1 increase in rates and, once in power, they find correct to impose a $ 5 increase! These are not the best nantized that will pay for this measure; These are the middle class families, who are already struggling to meet the two ends, "said Stéphane Bédard.

As for the member for Terrebonne, he stressed that the Minister of the Family, Francine Charbonneau, has still not denied that it intends to further tax the families of the middle class by modulating the rates according to the income.

"The minister says everything is still on the table. However, we are seeing today that its idea is made and that families will pay more. She also says that the many scenarios examined are constantly changing. The truth is that it does not control, except for the intention of chargeing families. Tackling the universality of ideology custody rates is to tackle equal opportunities and the essence of the network created 15 years ago. I remind him that childcare services is an investment, not an expense, "added Mathieu Traversy

"Let's not forget that the Ottawa government, for its part, has just increased federal tax credits for child care. However, Quebec families do not benefit from our network. And what does the Government of Philippe Couillard do to remedy this problem? It piges in the pockets of already surcharged families, "concluded Stéphane Bédard.
