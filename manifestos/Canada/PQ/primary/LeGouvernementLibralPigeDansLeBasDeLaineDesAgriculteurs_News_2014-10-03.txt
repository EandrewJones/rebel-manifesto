Quebec- The member for Berthier and official opposition spokesperson for agriculture, André Villeneuve, denounces the Cup of $ 113 million by the Liberal government in the Budget of Agricultural Financial. 
"Financial is the low wool of farmers for difficult years; It only starts recovering deficits in recent years. The 2014-2015 budget year had to be the one where the Financial puts his deficit behind her. And it is now that Minister Pierre Paradis decides to give a contribution leave to the government, pretending that there is enough money in the coffers. This is unacceptable; The government charges farmers the price of its austerity policies, "said André Villeneuve. 
The hon. Member stresses that in the event of a difficult year, the underfunding of the financial could result in a return to enormous accumulated deficits, as we saw in 2010, where they exceeded $ 500 million. 
"With municipal pension schemes, we see today what happens when one is piged in the surpluses and that we are given members of the contribution. When difficult years come back, the chests are already empty. The agriculture sector creates wealth and stimulate the economy. Once again, the government focuses on the expenditure column instead of having an economic plan to increase revenues and stimulate job creation, "concluded André Villeneuve.
