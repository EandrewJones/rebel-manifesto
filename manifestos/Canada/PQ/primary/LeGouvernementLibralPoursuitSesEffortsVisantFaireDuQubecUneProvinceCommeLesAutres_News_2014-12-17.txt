Quebec- The member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson in Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, strongly regrets the decision of the Liberal government, announced in the holidays approach, to close the Bureau du Québec. In Ottawa and the Quebec antenna in Vancouver. 
"The Liberal government has already fully dropped to the federal government. The Prime Minister leaves Ottawa to decide what is happening on our territory, especially environmentally and with respect to federal health transfers. How to ensure that the voice and interests of Quebec are heard in the capital of Canada if Quebec is no longer there? Philippe Couillard continues his great walk to his own goal: making Quebec a province like the others, "said Stéphane Bergeron. 
However, Quebec has been present in Ottawa since 1908 to ensure its interests in the federal capital. In 1984, he consolidated his presence by establishing the Quebec office in Ottawa, as we know today. "In his trivialization efforts of Quebec, Philippe Couillard breaks with the traditional policy of our national government; The closure of the Quebec office in Ottawa illustrates it eloquently, "added the deputy to Verchères. 
The decision to close our Vancouver antenna is just as incomprehensible and potentially harmful. "Every year, Quebec exports for $ 5 billion in products and services to British Columbia. These important exchanges will now be managed from Toronto. However, to improve them, the presence in the field and close to on-site companies is essential. The closure of the Quebec antenna in Vancouver is a nonsense, "concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
