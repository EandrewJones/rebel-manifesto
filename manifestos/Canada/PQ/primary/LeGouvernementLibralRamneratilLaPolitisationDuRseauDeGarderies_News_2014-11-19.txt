Quebec- The member for Terrebonne and the official opposition on the family, Mathieu Traversy, is concerned that the government, considering the conversion of the unprovanized places in subsidized places, return to the time of politicization From the award of places, to the source of the scandal of liberal daycares. 
"The conversion will have the same consequences as what denounces the Auditor General's report in the wake of the liberal daycare scandal: a disordered and subjective development. Do we understand the minister's will, who intends to promote private child care, that she will evacuate the transparent selection of projects, through regional selection committees, and reduce the network politicization, such as At the time of Tony Tomassi? ", Questioned Mathieu Traversy. 
The hon. Member recalls the words that Minister Francine Charbonneau held last June, during the study of budgetary appropriations; She then said against the conversion, since this process did not create any new place: "I do not create any more, I do just accommodate people who opened daycares," she said. 
"This summer, the minister was against conversion. Today, she is for. Who convinced him to change his mind? The president of the coalition of non-subsidized private childcare of Quebec and former Candidate of the PLQ in Blainville? Non-subsidized private daycares are mainly located in the metropolitan area; What does the Minister tell the Minister for disadvantaged and other regions of Quebec, who had received their confirmation for new places and who have seen their project be stopped? ", Concluded the member for Terrebonne.
