The government must now move forward to acts, assuming its environmental jurisdiction and renouncing delegating its environmental assessments to the National Energy Board.

For the continuation of things, it is very clear: the National Energy Board is an organization that no longer has the necessary credibility to make a decision on behalf of Quebeckers, "concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
