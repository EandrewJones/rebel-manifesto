Quebec, July 2, 2014 -The MP for Berthier and official opposition spokesman for agriculture, fisheries and food, André Villeneuve, said, today, during the study of credits Budget from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPAQ), a letter from the Federal Minister of International Trade, Ed Fast. Dated October 16, 2013, this letter indicates that its government will offset dairy farmers, before ratification by the National Assembly of the Global Economic and Trade Agreement (AECG) between Canada and the European Union. 
"The Government receives not only on a request made by the Parti Québécois government, but also on a gain we got. Even the federal government agreed that dairy and cheese producers had to be adequately offset before the National Assembly ratifies the agreement, "said André Villeneuve. 
Recall that according to the CETA, more than 17,700 additional tonnes of European cheeses will enroll in the Canadian and Quebec markets. The shortfall of Quebec producers must be offset. 
"It is essential that the government come back to the reason and supports our producers, so that they receive full compensation. Minister Pierre Paradis continued to deny his responsibilities today during the study of credits. What we understand from his remarks is that he throws the sponge permanently, and it is unacceptable, "concluded the member for Berthier.
