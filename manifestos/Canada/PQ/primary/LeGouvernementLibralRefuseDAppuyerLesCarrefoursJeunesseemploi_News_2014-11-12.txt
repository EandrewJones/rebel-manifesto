Quebec- The member for Saint-Jean and the official opposition spokesman for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, regrets that the government missed the opportunity today , to return to his decision to change the mission of youth cross-employment (CJE). It has indeed refused to consent to a motion in this sense filed by the member of the Parti Québécois. 
"The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, François Blais, had several times the opportunity to retreat and hear reason. He refuses to do it. Helping young people who have the most difficulty integrating into the job market, we agree. But why give up all others who use CJE services in all regions of Quebec? Why abandon an effective tool for socioeconomic development of regions? Asked Dave Turcotte. 
The motion refused by the Liberals asked the Government of Quebec to preserve the current mission of the Youth-Emploi crossings by maintaining the possibility for all 16 to 35 year olds to use the services of their youth cross-employment, and to maintain financing linked to the mission of youth cross-employment. 
"Young people and stakeholders are mobilizing, throughout Quebec, to maintain the Mission and Resources of CEPs. The testimonials accumulate, but the government remains deaf to these thousands of young people who were able to get support, walk and get out of it through CEPs. When will the government recover? "Added the hon. Saint-Jean.
