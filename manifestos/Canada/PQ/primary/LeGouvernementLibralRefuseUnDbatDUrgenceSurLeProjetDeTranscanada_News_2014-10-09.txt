Quebec- The member for Jonquière and the official opposition spokeswoman in sustainable development and environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, denounces the Liberal party's refusal to hold the National Assembly an emergency debate on the draft TransCanada to Gros-Cacouna, despite the fact that the drilling will resume on October 16 and that the National Assembly will not sit by then. 
This refusal of the government and the silence of the Coalition Future Québec on this subject are unacceptable. Remember that six environmental groups also call for emergency debate in the National Assembly. The Parti Québécois therefore asks David Heurtel to take responsibility and act as a real Minister of the Quebec environment. "Drilling should be suspended immediately. If even exploratory drilling, jeopardize a threatened species is that they just have to take place! The minister refuses to see this evidence, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
The member also stresses on the independent investigation claim he made last week, and today even in parliamentary committee, concerning the granting of the Certificate of Authorization to TransCanada. The government still refuses to trigger this investigation. 
"The Liberals do not want to shed light, preferring Omerta to officials. This intimidation on their part is very disturbing. We have to know what happened. The certificate of authorization was issued in contravention of all rules, notably without scientific advice. By choosing to comply with TransCanada's requests, the government has lost a good opportunity to act in the interest of the population. Common sense and transparency have clearly disappeared from the Liberal Radar screen, to the detriment of the interests of citizens and the preservation of our environment, "concluded the member for Jonquière.
