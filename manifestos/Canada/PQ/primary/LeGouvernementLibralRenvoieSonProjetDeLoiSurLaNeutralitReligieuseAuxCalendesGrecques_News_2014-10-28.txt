"The government is dragging their feet on this issue, while the Prime Minister promised to act quickly. Today, the Minister of Justice, Stéphanie Valley, referred the bill to the Bill at Greek Calendos. The truth is that the Liberals are trying to save time. Unfortunately, the news has caught them. The government must act without delay and introduced a bill to combat fundamentalism, "said Agnès Maltese.

The hon. Member for Taschereau also indicates that the government has obviously not intend to set up an organization to measure religious fundamentalism and fight against this phenomenon in our society.

"This idea was promoted by the former member of the Pinière, Fatima Houda-Pepin, the very one that was driven out of the Liberal caucus by the Prime Minister. Should we understand that the creation of this body has been evacuated from the liberal radar at the same time as the former member of the Pinière? "Agnès Maltais concluded.
