Quebec, October 17, 2014 -The MP for Gaspé and Official Opposition Spokesman on Municipal Affairs and Regions, Gaétan Lelièvre, and the member for Saint-Jérôme and spokesperson Economics, Entrepreneurship, SMEs and Exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, join their voices to that of the many local elected officials and stakeholders who ask the Liberal government to be clear and transparent with local development centers (CLD), tools essential to the economy of the regions of Quebec. 
This week, the Liberal MP in Abitibi East, Guy Bourgeois, pointed out that the remodeling of CLD would surely be done during the next year. "The government has already cut 8 million in CLD activities. Liberal MPs and Ministers now leave the threat of a reorganization of the CLD's administration and mission. This "remodeling" is done without any consultation of the main interested parties. The Liberals are once again proof that the economic and social development of the regions is not a priority for them. Behind the major support speeches to municipalities, MRCs and the regions, we find that the liberal austerity measures are harmful to them, "said Gaétan Lelièvre. 
According to the member, CLDs are best able to identify areas for the future for local development. They accompany communities and entrepreneurs for starting business and the development of carrier projects. 
For his part, the member for Saint-Jérôme adds that the liberal government's austerity measures affect socio-economic development and job creation, throughout Quebec. 
"The liberal effect means job losses and stagnation of the economy. More than 50,000 full-time jobs have been lost since the arrival of the Liberals. The government focuses on spending, without acting on state income. Developing regions, supporting CLDs, is essential. The government must be clear with these organizations, instead of allowing the concerns, "concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
