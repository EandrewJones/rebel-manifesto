Quebec- The Quebec Party spokesperson in education, research and educational perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, regrets that the government abandons support for school perseverance in favor of a brewing of structures that does not help students. Indeed, despite its electoral commitment to make education a priority, the Liberal government multiplies the cuts in this sector and jeopardizes the network of organizations that fight the dropout across Quebec. 
"Last September, in the wake of tens of millions of dollars that affected programs that encourage school perseverance, I questioned the Minister of Education. He admitted his mistake and made the commitment, before all the members of the National Assembly, restore the sums. However, five months later, no reinvestment was announced, and the sacrifice of programs and professionals who encourage young people to stay at school continues, "said Alexandre Cloutier. 
It should be noted that the days of school perseverance, which will take place from February 15 to 19, are a unique opportunity for all Quebec students to participate in activities aimed at raising awareness of the importance of education, and to encourage education Our young people continue their studies and graduate. 
"Next week, however, these are thousands of young people who will be deprived of activities. In Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue, in Laval and Quebec City, none is scheduled because the partner organizations have been closed because of the cutting of the Couillard. In recent months, they are hundreds of projects that have been abandoned across all regions. For a prime minister who claims to make education a priority, it's a failure; He continues to prove to us the opposite. When a real plan for promoting the academic success of our young people? ", Concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
