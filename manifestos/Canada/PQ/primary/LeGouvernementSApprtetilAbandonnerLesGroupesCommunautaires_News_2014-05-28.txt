Quebec- The member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, Jean-François Lisée, deplores the refusal of the Minister delegated to Rehabilitation, the Protection of Youth and Public Health, Lucie Charlebois, to undertake to pay the amounts provided for to community organizations. The coalition of the regional tables of community organizations as well as the provincial group of community and voluntary organizations have been very disappointed with their meeting today with the Deputy Minister. 
"At the very moment when the Prime Minister repeated that he would respect his commitment to protect people with low income, it is incomprehensible that his minister refuses to give any hope that it was to the groups she met," said Jean -François listed. 
"Refusing to confirm the enhancement of the funding of community organizations, announced by our Government is to jeopardize hundreds of projects deployed through Quebec and actions that are asked on a daily basis to the most vulnerable people," Added the member. 
The wealth of a society is also measured by the way it takes care of the poorest, and this involves supporting community organizations. The Québec Party Government had planned an increase of $ 54 million a year, an acquisition and renovation program of $ 10 million for these groups and support measures for the 4,000 community organizations concerned. 
"The Liberal Party can not, after supporting, in a unanimous motion in May 2013, these same groups in their requests, change its shoulder rifle and refuse to enhance the financing of their global mission. If he confirms this orientation to the budget, he will have denied his word and turned his back to the most fragile citizens of our society, "concluded Jean-François Lisée, who also noted the decision of the CAQ to no longer support the groups. Community.
