Quebec- The Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet, said today's project to lengthen certain activities to seek or exploit natural gas in the shale in The Lowlands of the St. Lawrence. With this bill, the licensing certificates issued will be suspended and any new issuance will be postponed until the National Assembly has adopted a comprehensive legislative framework on the exploration and exploitation of gas resources. The maximum life of the moratorium is five years. 
"With this bill, the government is fulfilling the commitment it took and I have my mingled last February. In addition to the mandate that will be entrusted to the BAPE, we announce today the prohibition of moving forward with the shale gas sector in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. We act for the sake of coherence while waiting to know the recommendations of the BAPE and the way in which the issue will be dealt with by the National Assembly. We can not assume the results of the consultation that will lead the BAPE in the coming months, but in the meantime, we will respect the concerns expressed by citizens for several years, "said Minister Blanchet. 
Recall that on February 6, 2013, the minister announced that it would entrust the BAPE with the mandate to carry out an expanded consultation that would be based on the studies commissioned as part of the strategic environmental assessment (EAS) on shale gas, particularly with respect to environmental, human and economic aspects. The BAPE will conduct this review as part of an expanded public consultation (generic BAPE "). 
"We are committed to working on the necessary convergence between the economic interests and environmental interests of Quebec. I also repeated that the department I head would be listening to the groups of citizens and that it would support its decisions on knowledge and science. This is what the implementation approach makes it possible to do. Decisions on the future of the shale gas sector will be able to take place in a framework based on the highest scientific standards. By then, a moratorium was needed. It is the rendezvous that Quebec and our government had given itself, and a commitment more than the government of the Parti Québécois realizes. I reiterate that the hand is stretched to opposition parties so that we are unanimous to reassure Quebecers, "concluded the Blanchet minister.
