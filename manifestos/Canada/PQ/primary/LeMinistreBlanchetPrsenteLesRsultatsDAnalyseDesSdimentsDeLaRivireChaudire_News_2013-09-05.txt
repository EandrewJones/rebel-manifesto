Quebec- Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Yves-François Blanchet, announces that sediment analysis results taken around the water intakes of the Boiler River are now available on the MDDEFP website. 
"As a promised, we make sure that the population has access to the most up-to-date data regarding the contamination of the sites affected by the Events of Lac-Mégantic. We will continue to act with rigor, transparency and effectiveness in the dissemination of the analytical results, the pace of the work done on the ground, "said the minister. 
The sediments taken near the water intake of Sainte-Marie and Lévis (Saint-Redeemer) do not have contamination by petroleum hydrocarbons. Sediments taken near the water intake of Saint-Georges have very low concentrations of oil hydrocarbons (C10-C50), at distances of more than 125 meters upstream of the Sartigan dam. These concentrations are not considered worrying for the ecosystem. 
At three intakes, metal concentrations in sampled sediments are similar to the historical data recorded in the Boiler River. 
Recall that only the results from the departmental analyzes are disseminated on its website. The ministerial data is available at the following address: http: //www.mddefp.gouv.qc.ca/lac-megantic/.
