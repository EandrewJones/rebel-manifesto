Quebec, July 10, 2014 -The MP for Saint John and Official Opposition spokesperson for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, denounces the decision of the Minister of the Minister Education, leisure and sport, Yves Bolduc, to suspend the holding of Quebec adults in training (SQAF), scheduled for the spring of 2015. 
"The government is swimming in full contradiction. While insisting on the importance of the professional qualification of Quebec workforce, so that it adds more to the needs of companies, it cuts the food at an event that works to promote itself in all The regions of Quebec, "sorry Dave Turcotte. 
The Quebec Adult Week is intended to interest the population in the principle of "lifelong learning". Grouping all actors in the education, training and work, this event sensitizes the general public and decision-makers to the many benefits of continuing education, adult education and professional development. 
"This news occurs as we have with sadness the loss of hundreds of jobs this week as a result of several factory closures in Quebec. In this context, the promotion and development of adult education appears to be essential for the revival of the economy of the affected areas, "added the member. 
Remember that the Liberal government cut $ 17 million in employment aid measures in its budget. "We are still waiting for the so-called liberal effect on economic development and job creation. The government must support workers and make concrete gestures to enable them to get and keep paying jobs, "the official opposition spokesman.
