Quebec, October 16, 2014 - The member for Sanguinet and the official opposition spokesman for the Treasury Board, Alain Therrien, calls on the President of the Treasury Board, Martin Coiteous, to take seriously the problems at the University Center. McGill Health (MUHC). We are learning today, in the press, that the former MUHC director, Arthur Porter, has drawn up "minimalist plans", at the origin of litigation opposing the center and the consortium responsible for its construction. 
In May, we were informed that the consortium was demanding more than $ 200 million for the construction of the MUHC. "Whenever the Parti Québécois asked in this regard, Minister Martin Maiteux was not worried over the potential cost overruns. Yet after the arrest of Arthur Porter, SNC-Lavalin leaders and project managers, the Liberal government should have made complete checks before taking possession, but left things, "lamented Alain Therrien. 
The member emphasized that the MUHC project, in public-private partnership (PPP), is once again a bad choice for Quebeckers. "Philippe Couillard, at the time Minister of Health, announced that with the PPP formula, cost overruns would be assumed by the private sector. How does he explain today that Quebec taxpayers are claimed? He then appointed his friend Arthur wear to the head of the MUHC. We know more, and the report made public today tells us that it is unfortunately not finished, "says the spokesman for the Parti Québécois. 
"Was the government started payments in the consortium despite all litigation? And how much, by the way, will cost the MUHC? The Liberals announced a $ 1.1 billion project in 2004, while today it is estimated at at least $ 2.8 billion, "concluded Alain Therien.
