Quebec- The Minister of Sustainable Development, the Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Daniel Breton, praised today, from 14 to 21 October 2012, from the twelfth edition of the Quebec Reduction Week waste (SQRD). The Quebec government associated itself with the realization of the SQRD through RECYC-QUÃ‰BEC, the major partner of the event since its inception. 
"The holding of such a week promotes the outbreak of new behaviors for the benefit of the reduction, re-employment and recycling, the 3R. In Quebec, more and more residual reduction initiatives are born thanks to the sustained involvement of different organizations. I would like to congratulate actions that, year after year, helps to raise awareness of Quebec citizens with the need to reduce the amount of residual materials they produce, "said the Breton Minister. 
The activities of the SDQR are in line with the Quebec residual material management policy, which aims to create a society without waste while maximizing the value added by a sound management of residual materials. Recall that nearly 13 million tonnes of residual materials are produced annually in Quebec. These materials, however, have an undeniable potential for the manufacture of goods and for the production of energy. 
"Quebec Waste Reduction Week is a real call for mobilization. It reminds us that we have a duty to act and adopt a responsible approach to the production of residual materials, both individually and collectively, "said the Breton Minister. 
For more than ten years, SQRD has allowed all Quebeckers to appropriate the 3R approach to manage ecologically, economic and sustainable our residual materials, which are in fact resources. SQRD highlights different types of 3R initiatives through several challenges (school challenge, Challenge Municipalities, SME Challenge and Challenge Surviving Without Packaging) and a Calendar of Activities held across Quebec.
