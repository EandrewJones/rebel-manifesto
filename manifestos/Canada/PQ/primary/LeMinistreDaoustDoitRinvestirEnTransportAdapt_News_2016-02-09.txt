Québec- The spokesman for the Parti Québécois on transport, maritime strategy, electrification of transport and digital strategy, Martine Ouellet, and the Executive Director of the Alliance of Consolidation of Adapted Transportation Users (ARUTAQ ), Rosanne Couture, arrested the Minister of Transport, Jacques Daoust, to reinvest in the adapted transportation services. 
Indeed, the member for Bourget, Maka Kotto, has deposited a Petition of the Arutaq today in the room. This petition of 2561 signatories asks the National Assembly: 
to engage in adequate funding that meets current needs and those already predictable related to the mobility of persons with disabilities, so as to promote their displacements; 
"The financing of the Quebec government in adapted transportation has almost not moved for almost 15 years. With the increased needs and inflation, so to say that we are witnessing a net disengagement of Quebec in this sector, including users and municipalities pay the price, "said Martine Ouellet. 
"It is unacceptable that people are deprived of going to school, to go to work and receive health care because of adapted transportation underfunding, which represents the only way they have for Getting around, "added Rosanne Couture for his part. 
"With the National Strategy for Sustainable Mobility, the former Quebec Party Minister, Sylvain Gaudreault, highlighted a series of measures to improve the adapted transportation offer. Given the fact that the aging of the population causes a steady increase in needs, it had chosen, for correctness, to improve the envelope. However, upon arrival, the Liberals have tablette our strategy and, since, nothing more. As if the situation was going to settle itself. However, there is emergency! The government must quickly reinvest in adapted transportation, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
