Qu√©bec- The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, today tabled the program of law NO51 amending the Law on Territorial Division, to replace the name of the judicial district of Hull by that of Gatineau. 
"The approach was necessary, both to take into account the new name given to this city and to respond to the repeated demands of the Outaouais Bar," said the Minister of Justice. 
The Territorial Division Act establishes the 36 judicial districts of Quebec, the municipalities and cities that are part of it as well as the municipality serving as chief town for each of these districts. This law has not been the subject of a real revision since 1975. However, several municipalities have changed their names, have been created or have been abolished as a result of municipal groupings. In order to efficient, the bill also proposes that the government can update the law by mere settlement rather than by bill. 
"From now on, it will be easier to change the name of the judicial district, its chief town and the list of municipalities that the district understands, which can change over the years. We also rely on the collaboration of parliamentarians to facilitate the adoption of this bill and thus respond to the demands of community stakeholders, "concluded Minister Bertrand St-Arnaud.
