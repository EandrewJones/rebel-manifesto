Quebec- The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, Announces Adoption, on the date of today, the Protection of the Territorial Division Act, in order to replace the name of the Judicial district of Hull by that of Gatineau. 
"In September 2012, at the Congress of the Province Lawyers Association, I was sensitized to this demand many times formulated by the Outaouais Bar. A few months later, in February 2013, during my visit from the University of Ottawa, I was repeated the demand. During these two meetings, I said that I would act and today it was proud that I announce that the name change of the chief town and the district will be effective next January, "said Minister Bertrand St-Arnaud. 
The provisions planned will also allow the Government to proceed from now on to the update of this law by mere settlement rather than the filing of a bill. 
"I thank the parliamentarians who have allowed the adoption of this bill. With the legislative changes, we will now be able to more effectively change the names of a judicial district, municipalities that compose it or a chief town, according to the changes that may occur over the years, "concluded Minister Bertrand St-Arnaud. 
The bill is part of a perspective of modernizing and clarifying the law to facilitate the accessibility of citizens to relevant information.
