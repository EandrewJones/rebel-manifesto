Quebec- The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, today launches a call for projects for the establishment of two new local justice centers, which will offer free legal information services and orientation to the population. 
This project call represents an additional step leading to the deployment of these non-profit organizations throughout Qu√©bec, in the wake of government commitments in access to justice. These two new centers will be added to the other three currently operating in Montreal, Quebec City and Rimouski. 
The mission of proximity justice centers is to promote access to justice by promoting citizen participation through information, support and guidance services offered in complementarity with existing resources. To date, the centers responded to more than 25,000 applications for legal information, whether in individual meetings or by telephone, in addition to organizing information sessions to popularize legal issues. 
"The teams of existing proximity justice centers have obtained very positive benefits, since 2010, thanks to their actions aimed at bringing the justice of citizens. I thank them for them and I hope that the representatives of the legal community and regional organizations will numerous to submit their candidacy to contribute to the creation of new centers in their respective circles, "said the Minister of Justice. 
Since April 1, 2013, proximity courts have benefited from permanent funding from the Justice Access Fund, an investment of $ 1.6 million for the 2013-2014 fiscal year. This fund administered by the Quebec Ministry of Justice is used for financing projects to bring citizens closer together. All information concerning the call for projects, ending November 22, as well as the nomination form are available online: www.justice.gouv.qc.ca.
