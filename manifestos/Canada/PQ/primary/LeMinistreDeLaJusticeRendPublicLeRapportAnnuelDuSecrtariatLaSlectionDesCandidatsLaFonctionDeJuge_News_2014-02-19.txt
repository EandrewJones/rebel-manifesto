Quebec- The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, today tabled the National Assembly the annual report of the activities of the Secretariat to the selection of candidates for the function of judge for the period covering Activities from February 1, 2013 to January 31, 2014. 
The production of this annual report is provided for in the Candidate Selection Procedure for the Court of Justice of the Court of Quebec, a judge of a municipal court and a magistrate justice. In addition to reporting calls related to calls for applications to fill vacancies, this report takes stock of the designations of judges to management positions as well as the nominations of alternate judges. The filing of this report makes it possible to make the selection process for the judge's function more transparent. 
During the reporting period, the Minister of Justice appointed 39 judges, both in the Quebec Court and the municipal courts. Among these judges, nearly half are women. These appointments have been done quickly so that courts have all judges allowed by law, which contributes to more effective justice. 
"As soon as I arrived, in September 2012, I made sure that our justice system is more accessible, faster and more efficient. That's why I have since recommended to the Council of Ministers the appointment of 58 new judges, including 45 to the Quebec Court. By far, a record in so little time! I am more particularly proud to have chosen these judges at the end of a rigorous and completely apolitical process and having selected women and men certainly recognized for their skills but also for their human qualities and their social and community involvement. , "Said the Minister of Justice. 
The annual report of the Secretariat's activities for the selection of candidates for the judge's function can be consulted on the website of the Quebec Ministry of Justice: www.justice.gouv.qc.ca.
