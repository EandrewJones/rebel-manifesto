Quebec- The Minister of Justice and Minister responsible for the fight against homophobia, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, today pointed out the International Day Against Homophobia, also called, in several European countries, International Day Against the homophobia and transphobia. 
This thematic day was born in Quebec in 2003, at the initiative of the Emergence Foundation. It is now celebrated in nearly about sixty countries around the world. International Day Against Homophobia is a gathering initiative that allows all stakeholders to unite their voice against discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
"For eight months, I have been involved in this fight against homophobia as responsible minister. I want to thank all the organizations that are involved in this fight to end the prejudices. I make a duty to work with them to build a more open Quebec, a Quebec for all, "said Minister Bertrand St-Arnaud. 
Since last September, the government's commitment has resulted in an increase in financial support of more than $ 600,000 to about twenty organizations for the promotion and advocacy of people from people of sexual minorities and an advertising campaign national awareness to combat homophobia. 
In addition, the Minister of Justice laid down the law 35, An Act to amend the Civil Civil Code for Civil Status, Estates and Advertising of Rights. This bill proposes to lift certain obstacles that transgender and transgender people face within the government apparatus. 
"In this day, I also want to reiterate the government's total commitment to combat any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Bill 35 is another important step in the full recognition of these people, "concluded the minister.
