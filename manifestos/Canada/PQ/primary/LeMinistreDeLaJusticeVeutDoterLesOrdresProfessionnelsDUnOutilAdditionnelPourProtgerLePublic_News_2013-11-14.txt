"When a serious criminal charge is carried out against one of its members, a professional order should be able to ensure that the public is adequately protected during the term of the trustee's investigation or the judicial process, of As much as several months, or even years, may elapse before a decision is made in the context of a criminal case. It is true of the public confidence in the professional system that follows the demands of several professional orders including the Quebec Bar and the Order of Engineers of Quebec, "said Minister Bertrand St-Arnaud.
