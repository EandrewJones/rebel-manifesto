The experiences of Bavaria and Saxony are interesting and I want to know more about their mode of operation. I will also be able to share our recent experiences in this area, "said the minister.

Bavaria is one of the largest partners in Quebec abroad. Recall that the governments of Quebec and Bavaria signed in March 2011 a joint declaration on collaboration in the field of public safety. This Declaration establishes a framework for collaboration between the Quebec Ministry of Public Safety and the Ministry of the Interior of the State of Bavaria, which allows the exchange of expertise and best practices in different areas of public safety.
