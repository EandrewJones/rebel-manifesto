Quebec- The Minister of Finance and Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau, responded favorably today to the results of the Quebec Filing and Investment Fund for the year 2012 made public this morning. "The results of the fund are satisfactory. They meet the long-term needs of depositors, "said the minister. 
Mr. Marceau has stressed the growth in total assets of the Caisse in Quebec, which is now $ 47.1 billion, an increase of nearly $ 6 billion from the previous year. "In the course of 2012, the Caisse did investment in companies that are proud of Quebeckers, such as CGI ($ 1 billion), Laurentian Bank ($ 100 million), Innergex (98 $ 9 million), Garda ($ 62.5 million) and CAE ($ 50 million), "said the minister. 
In addition, he welcomed the investments made by the Caisse last year, in partnership with the Desjardins Movement, in more than sixty small and medium-sized businesses in all regions of Quebec. He recalled that the Caisse had increased by $ 150 million its funds for small businesses in Quebec. This is now $ 200 million. 
"The yield obtained by the Caisse in 2012 shows very well that the search for optimal performance and economic development, far from irreconcilable, go hand in hand," concluded the minister.
