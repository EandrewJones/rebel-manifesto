Quebec- As a result of the presentation of the results of the Fund and Investment of Quebec, the Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau, said he was satisfied with the yield of 13.1% obtained in 2013 . "For a second consecutive year, the performance of the Caisse is greater than the long-term needs of its depositors," said the minister. 
The performance of a fund manager such as the Fund, whose net assets now reaches $ 200 billion, is also measured, and above all, in the long term. "In this respect, the average return of 10% obtained by the Caisse over the last four years worthy of emphasis," said the minister. 
In addition, he was pleased to see that the assets of the Caisse in Quebec increased by $ 20.3 billion over the last four years. These are now $ 53.8 billion. The Minister recalled that the Caisse, in addition to being the Manager of the Major Public Pension and Insurance Plans, is a leading economic actor. 
"The results announced today are the proof, once again, that the two components of the Fund's mission, or the search for an optimal performance and economic development of Quebec, can coexist in a cost-effective and sustainable way" , concluded the minister.
