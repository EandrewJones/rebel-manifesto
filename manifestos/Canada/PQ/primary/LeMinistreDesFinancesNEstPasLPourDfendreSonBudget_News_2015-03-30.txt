Quebec- The member for Rousseau and the official opposition for the finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, denounces the absence of the Minister of Finance, Carlos Leit√£o, at the first question period following the filing of his budget . 
"As his government called members of Parliament to sit today, the Minister of Finance preferred to get away. Perhaps it is embarrassed by its budget away from balance and does not take into account the consequences of austerity on middle-class families and regions of Quebec? He abandoned the economy and revenue growth to achieve fiscal balance only by cutting in public services, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
"The budget tabled last Thursday is an unprecedented attack against public services. It's a budget that will hurt families, who will hurt the sick, and who will hurt our young people by sabling what they have more valuable for their future, that is to say their education . It was expected from the Minister to at least defend his budget before the elected officials of the National Assembly, "concluded the spokesperson.
