"Virtually all Canadian banks have subsidiaries in several tax havens. Quebeckers ask questions, and with reason. Why need as many subsidiaries in tax havens where the tax rate is virtually zero? Unfortunately, the Minister of Finance did not defend taxpayers at the National Assembly when I questioned it today; He preferred to take the Canadian banking party, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
"The Minister and the Prime Minister will agree that tax evasion is a serious and mostly unfair phenomenon for honest Quebeckers who pay their taxes. Moreover, the rich who practice it benefits from an amnesty program, and the accomplices banks benefit, in fact, permanent impunity. Nobody is sanctioned, so. Quebeckers want it to change! ", Concluded the member. 
Remember that last week, the Parti Québécois asked the Committee on Public Finance to make a mandate of initiative on the tax evasion practiced by Quebeckers and banks. The Commission will meet soon to determine whether it agrees to seize this mandate.
