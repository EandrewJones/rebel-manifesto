Quebec- Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr. François Gendron, wants to take advantage of the 12th Gala Recognition of the Agricultural World to highlight the dynamism of farmers and farmers of Côte-du-south as well as their considerable contribution to the rise of the Quebec bioalimentary sector. 
"I congratulate the Farmers' Union of the South Coast for this beautiful initiative that recognizes the work of women and men who build on a daily basis, which we can be proud of. I am pleased to be able to count on partners in this caliber, while we are to implement the food sovereignty, which will certainly mark the history of this sector, "said François Gendron. 
The minister was disappointed not to be able to attend the Gala but, given the importance of the activity, he entrusted his special advisor in agriculture the mandate to represent him. 
"In this year when family farming is in the spotlight, as the United Nations has decreed, these opportunities to pay tribute to enthusiasts who often work in the shade take all their importance. Hat to all laureates and all the winners who will be honored by their peers at the Pocatière! He concluded Mr. Gendron. 
With investments of $ 2.3 billion and an annual food demand of nearly $ 34 billion generating 475,000 jobs, the biofood industry is an engine of the Quebec economy.
