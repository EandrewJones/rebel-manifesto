Quebec- The Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the Territory and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, takes note of the decision today by the Quebec City Commission (CMQ) concerning the upcoming lifting of the tutelage of the city of Laval. 
"Today, I am pleased to see that the transition started in the aftermath of the municipal elections took place rightly and allowed Laval's elected officials to assume their new mandate. It is with rigor and a great spirit of openness that these same elected officials collaborated, upon entry into office, with the Trusteeship Council in order to quickly restore the full powers to the Municipal Council. I would like to salute the exemplary work of the CMQ and the guardianship council who ensured the voucher of the city, with the interest of Lavalois as the main motivation, since last June, "said the minister. 
Remember that the Government of Quebec has undergone the city of Lavalle June 3 to provide the services to the population and the management of current affairs following the allegations of malpractices affecting the previous administration. The transition process will continue until the lifting of the tutelage, which will take effect on December 9th.
