Quebec- The Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister Responsible for Elders, Dr. Réjean Hébert, today announced the addition of additional professional resources in 60 family medicine groups (GMF) across Quebec. These GMF will share a total of 181.5 full-time equivalents (FTEs) to complement their professional workforce, representing an annual investment of $ 13.6 million. More specifically, each of the 60 GMF is granted between 1.5 and 5 FTEs, for an average of a little more than 3 FTEs each. 
"The addition of professionals such as nutritionists, social workers or kinesiologists to physicians is a way to support GMF medical practice because it allows better patient follow-up, especially those with chronic diseases. Dr. Hébert explained. 
This addition of professionals is attributed to the GMFs according to their performance against certain established criteria, including the respect and renewal of their contractual agreement, the achievement of their target of client entries, as well as their offer of service in unfavorable hours (evening and weekend), depending on the volume of registered patients. The eligibility of a GMF to the granting of additional professional resources will be evaluated twice during the year, or on January 1, when the GMF inscriptions revised, as well as the renewal of its accreditation. 
"The GMF formula has already proven itself. Thus the consolidation of the GMF network is one of our government's priority actions to improve the accessibility and continuity of front-line health care and health services. We are committed to achieving a series of measures to this effect, and the allocation of new resources for the most successful GMFs, "said Minister Hébert.
