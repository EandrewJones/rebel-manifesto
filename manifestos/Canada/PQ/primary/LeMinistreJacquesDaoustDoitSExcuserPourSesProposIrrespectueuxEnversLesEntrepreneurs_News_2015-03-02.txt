Québec- The member for Saint-Jérôme and the official opposition spokesman in the field of economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, as well as the member for Gaspé and spokesperson Development of the regions, Gaétan Lelièvre, denounce the words of Minister Jacques Daoust, in which he described entrepreneurs in the region to face a bankruptcy as "village kings". How can the minister be so condescending to entrepreneurs? These prejudices and this lack of respect are unacceptable; The Minister must apologize. 
The minister said, in fact, that a bankruptcy "does mostly hurt the ego in the region, because when you are the king of the village, and that you have to go bankrupt, it's difficult." 
"How can the minister be a credible interlocutor for entrepreneurs if he demonstrates as little recognition and appreciation for their work? What company in particular did he think when he talked about "village king"? When a firm company, there are job losses and difficulties for suppliers and other associates; This is the real problem, and the minister does not seem to see him. Degrouping entrepreneurs, particularly those in the region, is siderer, especially when we know that it is the SMEs in the region that create employment and support economic development, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"By cutting into the development tools and resources we gave ourselves, the Liberal government is under 40 years of consultation and development in the region. Seeing the little consideration shown by Minister Jacques Daoust, we understand the will of centralization at the heart of imposed cuts. The effects of corporate closures hurt our regions; How will the minister be able to listen to the entrepreneurs so much, if he treats them with so little respect? "A concluded Gaétan Lelièvre.
