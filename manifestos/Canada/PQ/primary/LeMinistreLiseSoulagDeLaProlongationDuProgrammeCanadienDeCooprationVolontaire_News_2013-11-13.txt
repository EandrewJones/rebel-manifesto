Montréal- The Minister of International Relations, Francophonie and Foreign Trade, Jean-François Lisée, said to be relieved of the announcement made on Tuesday by the federal authorities responsible for international development to extend the voluntary cooperation program for an additional year. 
This decision occurs while international cooperation agencies (OIC) participating in the program were preparing to repatriate hundreds of cooperants and dismantling infrastructure in several southern countries. 
"This exceptionally late decision is the culmination of several months of pressure from the international cooperation organizations of Quebec, the adoption of a unanimous motion of the International Assembly and the repeated interventions of our department to the federal authorities He said the minister listed, who directly referred to these questions in June, September and November with his federal counterparts. 
This extension is, however, only a temporary solution, as the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada conduct a general revision of the international development programs that are not known. OICs are still without new on two other important programs used to finance cooperation projects. 
Remember that in recent years have been trying for Quebec OIC, who have made the costs of significant cuts in Canadian international assistance budgets in addition to seeing the Quebec share of budgets decrease in alarming. In constant contact with the AQOCI, the minister listed follows the file with a lot of attention.
