Montr√©al - On behalf of the Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, the member for Rimouski, Irvin Pelletier, announces a $ 254,000 agreement with the City of Rimouski for the relocation of the BIC Library. 
The agreement in principle will allow the city of Rimouski to complete the studies and the definition of the project to relocate this library. The purpose of the latter is to offer a greater area to this important cultural place, because the current building no longer meets the needs of citizens of the BIC. 
"I am proud to support this project that will provide access to BIC people to a collection of literary works enriched, but also to a large number of diversified activities at the very heart of their community. The role of libraries can play as a place of meetings, exchanges and dissemination of our culture. The population of BIC will now be fully benefiting, "said Minister Kotto. 
"This project will certainly help increase the attendance of the Public Library, in addition to providing better access to animation activities and cultural products. I am enthusiastic about this announcement because the economic, social and cultural health of our regions goes through local services and a quality community life, "continued Mr. Pelletier. 
It was the former BIC Town Hall that was chosen to accommodate the library. This excess building, located near a center of early childhood, a playground and an elderly residence, will be recycled. The population will benefit from greater space, a collection of larger books, varied exhibitions and access for people with reduced mobility. This project will help improve the supply of cultural services in the environment. 
The agreement in principle is made possible through the Department of Culture and Communications Capital Assistance Program. The city of Rimouski is a partner of this project by also contributing to $ 254,000, the second half of the total amount for its estimated achievement at $ 508,000.
