Qu√©bec- The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, announces the award of $ 12,700 financial assistance to the municipality of the Islet for the realization of restoration works of the Marine Chapel. 
The restoration project is estimated at nearly $ 32,000 and focuses on the building's external envelope. The Chapel of the Marins was built in 1835 and classified under the Cultural Heritage Act in 1981. As part of the rich heritage of the municipality of Islet, this small religious building recalls the important maritime past of the Islet where many sailors and pilots of the St. Lawrence were established. The names of those missing at sea are inscribed on panels arranged inside. 
"I am pleased to anticipate the fact that today's contribution will continue to maintain an important witness in our history for present and future generations. We have the responsibility, as a nation, to support our efforts to maintain and enhance these valuable legacies, "said Minister Kotto. 
The financial assistance of the Ministry of Culture and Communications comes from component 1 of the Quebec Cultural Heritage Fund and represents 40% of the cost of eligible work. Remember that the purpose of this fund is to contribute to the conservation and development of cultural property with significant heritage value. 
Additional information regarding the chapel of the sailors are available on the website of the Cultural Heritage Directory of Quebec (RPCQ) (www.patrimoine-culturel.gouv.qc.ca). This dissemination tool of the Ministry of Culture and Communications makes it possible to discover the richness and diversity of the Quebec cultural heritage by making it accessible to all. Part of the RPCQ content is now on the Open Data Portal of the Government of Quebec (www.donnes.gouv.qc.ca).
