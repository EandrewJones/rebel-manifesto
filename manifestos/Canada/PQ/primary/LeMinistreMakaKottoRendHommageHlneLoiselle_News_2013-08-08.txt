Québec - It is with sadness that the Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, learned the death of the great comedian Hélène Loiselle. In many securities, we can consider this artist engaged as one of the pioneers of the development of theater in Quebec. His contributions have been innumerable and nothing about the interpretation was foreign to him. Its name is also the distribution of the first radioromans and radiothetres made in Quebec. 
"Hélène Loiselle will have marked the theater and the Quebec cinema by his unique way to transcend the characters. She admirably defended her roles in the first pieces of Michel Tremblay: sister-in-laws; In spare parts; To you, forever, your Marie-Lou. It leaves us the memory of an accomplished artist with a vibrant game while restrained. Of course, we can not ignore its social and political commitment and its deep attachment to Quebec, "said Minister Kotto. 
Very discreet in life, she literally exploded on stage and on the screen, with characters she liked to embody with originality and which testified of her great versatility. Foreground roles have been entrusted to many television and television series, and it was also from the adventure of the first youth issues on Quebec television. At the golden age of teletheatres broadcast by Radio-Canada, it has played in many classical and contemporary works. 
The minister wanted to present his condolences to the relatives of the comedian and the whole of the artistic community.
