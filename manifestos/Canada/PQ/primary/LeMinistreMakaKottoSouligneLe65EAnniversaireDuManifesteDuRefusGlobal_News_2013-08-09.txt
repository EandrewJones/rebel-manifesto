Quebec- The Minister of Culture and Communications, Mr. Maka Kotto, on behalf of the Government of Quebec, wishes to emphasize the anniversary of the publication of the Global Duefus Manifesto, which has been a form of revolution by wanting to bring a new company Quebec. A return in 1948 brings us back to this group of young artists from the automation movement. At the head of the group, the painter Paul-Émile Borduas writes the manuscript to bring the artists to no longer live in the margins of history, and the company to no longer live folded on itself. 
"To affix his signature at the bottom of the global hardfus manifesto was a daring gesture, a call to the right to exist, a way to turn his back on academism and to express themselves high and strong in favor of freedom of expression. This document carries with him a great turn for the culture of Quebec and the beginning of an era of artistic emancipation, "said Minister Maka Kotto. He also added that Lerefus Globalura allowed in Quebec to discover the aspirations of young artists wanting to jostle the established order and the traditional values of the time. They made their voices heard in the public debate and contributed to the recognition of the status of the artist. 
In short, the global refusal will have allowed Quebec to discover the aspirations of young artists wanting to jostle the established order and the traditional ambient values of the time. In addition to the painter Paul-Émile Borduas, the other signatories of the manifesto were Françoise Sullivan, Marcelle Ferron, Muriel Guilbault, Louise Renaud, Madeleine Arbor, Thérèse Renaud, Françoise Riopelle, as well as Fernand Leduc, Pierre Gauvreau, Jean-Paul Riopelle, Marcel Barbeau, Jean-Paul Mousseau, Bruno Cormier, Maurice Perron and Claude Gauvreau.
