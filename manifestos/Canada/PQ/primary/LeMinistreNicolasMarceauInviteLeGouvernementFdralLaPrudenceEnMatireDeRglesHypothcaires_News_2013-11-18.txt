In fact, the Finance Minister of Canada, Mr. Jim Flaherty, suggested in recent days that he was considering setting up a fifth round of measures to contain the possible rise in dwellings. "The Quebec residential real estate market is currently in equilibrium. Additional boundaries of mortgage rules could have negative consequences in this market and the Quebec economy, "said Minister Marceau. 
He stressed that residential construction expenditures had about 7.0% of Quebec GDP. Currently, all available data show that the Quebec real estate market is in a balance. For example, from January to October 2013, the average price of existing housing has remained with a variation of 0.2% compared to the same period in 2012. In addition, pressure on prices should remain limited during the course Next months since the resale market is currently in a balance. 
"These data indicate that the Quebec residential sector does not need new measures to brake it, unlike other Canadian markets that have signs of overheating, such as Toronto and Vancouver. I invite Mr. Flaherty to avoid intervening with pan-Canadian policies that could harm certain markets, including Quebec, "concluded the minister.
