Quebec- The member for Marie-Victorin and official opposition on energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, denounces the attitude of Minister Pierre Arcand; He has not only confirmed the upcoming rise in Hydro-Québec rates, but he also refused to deny the privatization scenario of the Crown corporation. 
Last week, on the first day of consultations on the new energy policy, the minister stated that Quebec consumers could be struck by an increase in their electricity bill. In fact, he claimed that "for those who use electricity in a very important way, there may be a price signal that could be sent." 
"In other words, the minister announces a modulated increase in tariffs, as his government has done in the daycare record. However, by acting thus, we increase the invoice overall. Today, I gave the Minister the opportunity to correct the shot; He repeated his remarks. It is therefore understandable that tariff increases are coming, added to all increases that have already hit the families of the middle class, "said Bernard Drainville.

The member also denounces the fact that the minister did not closer the door to the privatization scenario of Hydro-Québec, a proposal part of the Montaguquette report. 
"Those who advocate the idea of the privatization of Hydro-Québec first want the state rises the rates, to increase its market value. Asked about this, the minister did not reject the privatization scenario. The Prime Minister has the duty to give the right time to Quebeckers. What will be the increase in tariffs, and is Hydro-Québec privatized? This state society is the symbol of our economic nationalism. It is a source of enrichment, it is a motor of economic development for the regions. The population has the right to know, "concluded Bernard Drainville.
