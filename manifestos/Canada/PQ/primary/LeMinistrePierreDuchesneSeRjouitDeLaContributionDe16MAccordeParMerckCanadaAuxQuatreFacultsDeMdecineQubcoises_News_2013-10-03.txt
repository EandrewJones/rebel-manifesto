Quebec- Minister of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology, Mr. Pierre Duchesne, welcomes Merck Canada's $ 16M contribution to medical faculties at Laval University, from the University of Sherbrooke, the University of Montreal and McGill University. In 2010, Merck is committed to paying $ 100 million over 5 years to various Quebec partners in support of innovation and academic, biotechnology and Quebec clinic. 
"This announcement clearly demonstrates that world-class companies like Merck trust Quebec's expertise to advance life sciences research. These partnership projects will consolidate and further develop our local expertise, while radiating it nationally and internationally. Research and teaching are inseparable, but especially essential for the future of all Quebeckers and all Quebeckers. Thus, Quebec must give rise to a strategy and means of action to participate in these networks of creation, use and dissemination of knowledge. That's why my ministry is currently working on the development of a new national research and innovation policy, "said Minister Duchesne.
