Quebec- The member for Berthier and the official opposition on agriculture, André Villeneuve, deplores that the offer of purchase of the Quebec slaughter cooperative for Levinoff-Colbex slaughterhouse was refused , which causes the dismantling of the slaughterhouse. 
"Access to a short circuit reform cattle slaughterhouse is essential for Quebec producers, who currently have to send their cattle to Ontario or the United States for slaughter. The Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, must find solutions so that they can make their cattle shoot in short circuit, "said André Villeneuve. 
The member points out that Saga Levinoff-Colbex has been very expensive for tax payers; The Liberals have invested significant amounts of money, against the opinion of civil servants. A report from the KPMG firm, published in 2014, also demonstrates the Liberal Fiasco on this issue. 
Also remember that the repurchase of the slaughterhouse, in the mid-2000s, was very profitable to the Cola brothers, important liberal donors also involved in the scandal of liberal daycares. Between 1999 and 2011, the Cola family paid $ 174,000 to the Liberal Party. 
"I ask the Minister Paradise to be attentive to the needs of producers and the agricultural community. Agriculture is creative of wealth; It is particularly important for the prosperity of our regions and all Quebec. It is clear that Investment Québec, the main creditor of the slaughterhouse, did not even receive the cooperative so that it presents its project, "concluded the spokesperson.
