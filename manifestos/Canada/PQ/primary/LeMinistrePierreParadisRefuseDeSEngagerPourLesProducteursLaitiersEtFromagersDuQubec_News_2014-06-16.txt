Quebec- The member for Berthier and official opposition spokesperson for agriculture, fisheries and food, André Villeneuve, judges that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Paradis , must be clearly committed to compensation for Quebec's dairy and cheese producers, for any losses they will have to assume in connection with the Global Economic and Trade Agreement (AECG) between Canada and the European Union. 
The words of Minister Paradis, last Friday at the National Assembly, had nothing to calm the concerns of Quebec dairy and cheese producers. "The minister says he supports producers, no more. However, time is no longer in the word, it is up to work. The minister must make a clear commitment to what Quebec does not ratify the agreement without a full compensation for our producers, "said André Villeneuve. 
In addition, last Thursday, the Liberal government refused its consent to adopt a motion by André Villeneuve. The motion was read as follows: 
"That the National Assembly requires  Government of Quebec an agreement  concluded between the government  federal and dairy farmers and  cheesemen guaranteeing a full  compensation for the 17,700 tons of  European fine cheeses that will enter  annually on the market, and that  This agreement and its modalities are  known before submitting the agreement  economic and global commercial between  Canada and the European Union to its  approval. » 
Given that according to the CETA, more than 17 000 tonnes of European cheeses will be added annually to what is already found in the Canadian and Quebec markets, the shortfall of Quebec producers must be offset and entry. European products on the market, spread over time. 
"The support of the Government of Quebec is an important trading lever for producers. We will continue to highlight the minister to make a clear position in favor of full compensation for our dairy and cheese producers, "concluded the member for Berthier.
