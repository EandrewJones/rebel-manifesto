Montréal- The member for Vachon and spokesperson for the Quebec's transportation Party, Martine Ouellet, deplores that the UBERX illegal taxi service continues its expansion in Quebec, under the nose of the Minister of Transport, Robert Poti, who refuse to act. 
"Since his arrival in Quebec, the UberX Illegal Transport Service continues to grow. The company announced yesterday, with great pomp, that it was now going to serve the cities of Laval and Longueuil. Meanwhile, while the company continues its expansion by defying the laws of Quebec, Minister Poëti affirms the lips that the service is illegal, "said Martine Ouellet. 
Earlier this week, the company spokesman said that the number of races UberX was growing up. This fall, during the event days of taxi drivers, UberX even had the pellet to offer discounts to its members. The company literally narrates the Quebec government, and Minister Poëti is content to look at the parade. 
"I have repeatedly asked the Minister Poeti to put an end to UBERX's illegal operations. I even filed an amendment in parliamentary committee to increase the fines imposed on illegal taxis, but the minister rejected. If he is really serious when he says he wants to tackle the illegality of UberX, I offer him all my collaboration to adopt a bill by Christmas. This law could provide for much larger fines, seizures of prolonged vehicles, points of incapacity, even going to the suspension of licenses for recidivists. The honest taxi drivers are fighting every day for a pay sometimes below the minimum wage. They must now deal with increasingly fierce illegal and unfair competition because the Liberal government is dragging their feet, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
