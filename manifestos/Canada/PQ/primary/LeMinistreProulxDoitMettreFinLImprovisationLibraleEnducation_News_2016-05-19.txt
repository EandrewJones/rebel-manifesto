Quebec- The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesman for the Parti Quebec in education, research and schooling perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, asks the Minister of Education, SÃ©bastien Proulx, to celebrate focus his efforts On the image of the Liberal Party of Quebec and to act concretely, as it promised, for the school success of young people. 
"While the minister loses time to affirm and reaffirm that he believes in the kindergarten 4 years, he is not even able to deliver the 70 additional classes announced last November. This is a concrete proof that the announcements of the past week are only a transaction to restore the image of its party, tarnished by the events of recent years: recall, 4 ministers have succeeded each other For 2 years, and cuts by hundreds of millions have been made in the network, "said the member for Lac-Saint-Jean. 
"When we questioned the Minister of Education, earlier this week, on his supposed new match plan, we stayed on our hunger. There was nothing about it in the last budget filed only 2 months ago, no time reserved to finance the new measures. There was nothing for kindergarten 4 years, nothing about school up to 18 years old, nothing for the National Institute in Education. In short, we are in the most complete improvisation. Obviously, the minister simply wanted to draw attention before the Liberal Congress, "added Alexandre Cloutier.
