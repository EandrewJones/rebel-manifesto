Québec- The member for Vachon and sentence of the official opposition on transport, electrification of transport and maritime strategy, Martine Ouellet, regrets that the Minister of Transport, Robert Poëti, refused to act to do so that the UberX Illegal Transport Service ceases to operate in Quebec. 
Last night, in a parliamentary committee on Bill 36, amending several transport laws, Martine Ouellet wanted to file an amendment to increase in those of several European countries that are imposed on UberX. The minister unfortunately refused to consent to the filing of the amendment. 
"The Minister Poëti has repeated that Dubberx is illegal, he refuses to take action to counter this service that continues to grow since his arrival in Quebec. However, during consultations related to the bill, we had the chance to hear several taxi industry stakeholders who explained to the minister that Duberx was harmful to the Quebec economy, "said Martine Ouellet. 
Seizures of vehicles have been made since last October, but UberX pays fines and takes charge of judicial costs; So, the service continues despite everything. The increase in fines, suggested by the Parti Québécois, would allow Quebec to come closer to the sanctions imposed in some European countries. 
"Salmed fines is what several European countries used to get out UberX. Meanwhile, in Quebec, representatives of Uberx have appeared in committee, where they openly said that they did not intend to change their practices, because they do not, it is not in UberX. to change his behavior, but to the law to adapt. Despite such an affront, the minister refuses to crack down; It is very damage for the taxi industry, which faces this unfair competition, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
