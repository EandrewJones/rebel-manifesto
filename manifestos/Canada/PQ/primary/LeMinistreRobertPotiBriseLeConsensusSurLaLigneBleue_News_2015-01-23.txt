Quebec- The member for Vachon and sentence of the official opposition on transport, Martine Ouellet, denounces the improvisation of the Minister of Transport, Robert PoÃ«ti, who announced that the Metropolitan Transportation Agency (AM) will study, At its request, the possibility that the extension of the blue line east of Montreal is made in the surface. 
"The trial and improvisation of the Liberal government in collective transport continue. This decision comes out of nowhere; The Minister changes the mandate of the Project Office without explaining why. While it has always been agreed that the prolongation of the blue line will take the form of a traditional metro, the minister, without warning person, changes completely from Cape Town, "said Martine Ouellet. 
The member also indicates that this amendment will result in several unfortunate consequences for citizens and users. "It will cost expensive because a surface train involves a complete new technology, both in terms of infrastructure and equipment. It will therefore be impossible to integrate a surface train to the technologies already in place for the subway. Let's add to that the important delay that the project will take, and the travel time for the 80,000 future users that will be longer, since they will have to use additional transportation means. The Minister Poeti must retreat. According to the AMT, the extension of the blue line will facilitate transport for 140,000 people; The minister must tell them quickly what he intends to do, "concluded the member of the Quebecois Party.
