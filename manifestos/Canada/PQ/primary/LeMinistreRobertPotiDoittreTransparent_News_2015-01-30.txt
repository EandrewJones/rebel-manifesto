Québec- Following the broadcast, yesterday, a report of the program survey about the light rail system (SLR) on the new Champlain Bridge, the member for Vachon and spokesman of the official opposition Transportation, Electrification of Transport and Maritime Strategy, Martine Ouellet, asks Minister Robert Poëti to be transparent and make the AECOM study public and the report of the Committee of Experts. 
"I hope it's not a new maneuver from the Liberal government to discredit the SLR and the Metropolitan Transportation Agency (AMT). Currently, we swim in the blur; The Minister of Transport, Robert Poëti, repeatedly refused to make the study of the AECOM firm and today another report from a mysterious committee of independent experts surface. In the SLR file, we are attending a rebound every two months. More than ever, the minister must be clear in his intentions and transparent to the population, "said Martine Ouellet. 
The member added that by declaring on the choice of SLR and introducing a new player in the equation, the Québec Deposit and Investment Fund, the Minister once again extends time and increases the costs of the study of the project. 
In the aftermath of the broadcast of the report on the issue investigation, the Parti Québécois wishes to clarify some facts. Let us first remember that the choice of the government of the Parti Québécois, which opted for the technological family of the SLR, was based on a study by Aecom. The project office then had to select the most suitable technology. The Parti Québécois is indeed in fact that the analysis studies should not be carried out by potential suppliers. Then, in the SLR file, the studies entrusted to the Bombardier / SNC-Lavalin consortium were before the arrival of the Quebecois Party, in September 2012. Finally, the current President and CEO of the AMT has erected a barrier between suppliers and the decisions of the AMT.
