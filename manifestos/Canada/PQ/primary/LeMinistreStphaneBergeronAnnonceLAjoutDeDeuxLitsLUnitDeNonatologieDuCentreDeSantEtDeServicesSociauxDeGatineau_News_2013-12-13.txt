"This investment is part of an action plan arising from the Perinatality Policy 2008-2018. Our government is committed to improving neonatology services, at the level of all Quebec, including regional centers such as Gatineau Hospital. In this way, fewer newborns must be transferred to subsequent centers. And if there is to be such a transfer, for example in Ottawa or Montreal's intensive neonatology units, the baby will be able to come back more quickly in the area, once his condition is stabilized. In short, more newborns will be able to receive specialized services in the living environment of their families, "said Minister Hébert.
