Gatineau - The new dialysis satellite unit of the Papineau Hospital has been inaugurated today by the Minister of Public Safety and Minister responsible for the Outaouais Region, Mr. St√©phane Bergeron, at the end of the works of 4,231,000 $. 
"The creation of units like this one has the great advantage of bringing the services of the patients. It is of paramount importance for people with chronic renal failure, since hemodialysis is offered for three treatments per week. That's why we strive, in Outaouais, as elsewhere in Quebec, to reduce travel times as much as possible to healthcare environments, for the benefit of affected people and their loved ones, "said Mr. Bergeron. 
The hemodialysis satellite unit was set up on the 4th floor of the Papineau Hospital, on an area of about 700 square meters. It has eleven treatment plants, including one in isolation and a reserve, which will eventually process up to 36 patients in the area of the region. 
The costs of planning the premises and acquisition of specialized equipment were jointly assumed by the Ministry of Health and Social Services ($ 2,000,000), the Health and Social Services Agency of the Outaouais ($ 931,000), the Papineau Health and Social Services Center ($ 300,000), as well as the Papineau Health Foundation ($ 1,000,000), which has been provided by private donors. 
"I want to emphasize the role played in this project by the Nephrologists team of Gatineau's Health and Social Services Center. Thanks to telemedicine, these specialists are able to provide remote clinical supervision. This is how care is also good and equally safe in the satellite units than in major hospitals, with significant gains from the perspective of accessibility, "concluded the Minister responsible for the Ottawa region.
