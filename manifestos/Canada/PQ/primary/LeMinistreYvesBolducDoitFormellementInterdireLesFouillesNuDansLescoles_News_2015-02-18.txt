Quebec- The member of Pointe-Aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for primary and secondary education, Nicole Léger, asks the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Yves Bolduc, Prohibit naked excavations in schools and immediately clarify the circumstances in which summary excavations can be made. 
"Quebec's parents learned with surprise yesterday that the leadership of the school of their child can dig up him if she suspects him to have committed an act offending the settlements of the institution. I think parents were surprised to hear that it could happen without being warned. For us, it's clear: parents should be notified. The case raised yesterday concerned a minor girl. It does not mean anything! Nicole Léger said. 
"Once again, yesterday, faithful to his habit, the minister went from an unfortunate statement. We had the impression that he took things lightly. Now today all parents are troubled and worried. Since in this case everything is a matter of proportion and means, the minister must quickly clarify the situation, "added the member. 
Three requests for the revision of the reference framework 
In addition, Nicole Léger made requests for the upcoming review of the Ministry of Education's reference framework on the police presence in educational institutions. "We want the minister to modify three things: first, he must prohibit namely naked excavations in schools, to dispel any misunderstanding. Then, when one proceeds to a summary search, the parents of the minor involved must be warned. Finally, the new framework will have to clarify the circumstances that make it possible to make summary excavations, concretely and explicitly, "she concluded.
