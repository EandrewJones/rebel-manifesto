Quebec, October 15, 2014 - The member for Joliette and sentence of the official opposition in higher education, Véronique Hivon, believes that the Minister of Higher Education, Yves Bolduc, must say whether direct cuts in The teaching programs of Quebec universities are acceptable. 
"Some universities have already confirmed that courses will be withdrawn from the 2014-15 winter schedule. Minister Yves Bolduc can not remain silent, while he imposes record compressions to the university network. He must say whether, yes or no, it is acceptable for the Liberal government that there are direct cuts in the offer of university courses in Quebec. He must also talk to us about the effects of these cups on the quality of teaching, research and course supply. Finally, transparency controls him to tell us if the next stage of his plan is to increase tuition fees, "said Véronique Hivon. 
It should be remembered that when it was in the opposition, the Liberal Party denounced high and strong for months the financial situation of universities. However, we are learning today that the liberal compressions for 2014-2015 will not be $ 172 million, as expected since the budget, but at least $ 200 million.
