Quebec, October 27, 2014 - Member of Pointe-Aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for primary and secondary education and school perseverance, Nicole Léger, considers that the Minister of Education, Leisure and Sport, Yves Bolduc, is the only person responsible for the unfortunate situation in which Quebec schools are currently located.

This morning, we learned in the sun that the school board of discoverers threatens a lawsuit a school that refuses to cut into assistance to the homework and the purchase of books.

"For several weeks, the Liberal Minister stated up and loud that the cuts he decreed in Quebec schools did not affect direct services to students. Then he taught school boards who refuse to obey him. Now, school boards put schools. Instead of talking about the quality of education to offer children, one is in legal procedures. It is the fault of Minister Yves Bolduc; He created these situations of uncertainty and must now assume responsibility for what is expected of a Minister of Education, "said Nicole Léger.

Remember that early October, the Liberal government has supported a motion by the Quebecois party, and reflecting the minister's comments for months, so that the cuts do not affect direct services to students.

"Rarely was seen a minister act so ill-ply. Yves Bolduc stained in the corner, it's now up to him. Certainly, he can not let the schools prevented in this quagmire; He must act quickly, "concluded the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles.
