Québec- The Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks and Head of the Regions of Mauricie and Center-du-Québec, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet, is pleased to announce, on behalf of the Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the Territory, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, a grant of $ 320,684 is granted to the City of Drummondville for the operation of the transit service. 
This grant is paid for the year 2013 as part of the Government Assistance Program for the Public Transport of Persons (PAGTCP). 
"Our Government encourages and supports the development of collective transport, which optimizes the use of the road network while increasing the fluidity of displacements, the decrease in the level of congestion and the reduction of pollution attributable to the consumption of hydrocarbons. . Today's announcement will allow the City of Drummondville to consolidate its achievements in public transit and to continue to provide a service that meets the needs of its users, "said Minister Blanchet. 
The Grant Grant of the PAGTCP aims to support the management of public transit by municipalities outside major urban centers, to improve services with respect to frequency and service, as well as to offer greater diversity to private carriers called to act as service providers to municipalities. 
"By participating in the financing of collective transport, we invest in the sustainable development and mobility of people, a social, environmental and economic challenge that is at the heart of the mission of our government," said Blanchet. 
The collective transport is one of the sitting stones of the next Quebec Policies of Sustainable Mobility. In the process of drawing up, this policy will take over from the Quebec collective transport policy. The new policy will place the user at the heart of his concerns and guide the actions that will be undertaken by 2020 to enhance the offer of collective transportation service throughout Quebec.
