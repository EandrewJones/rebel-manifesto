Quebec - Member for Matapédia and official opposition spokesperson for social services and seniors, Danielle Doyer, and the hon. Member for Saint-Jean, Dave Turcotte, demand that the Liberal government returns back for the three New CHSLD projects in PPP mode planned for Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Châteauguay and Granby. "In front of the Fiasco of CHSLD's first PPP mode of Saint-Lambert-sur-Le-Golf, it is more time that the Minister of Health ceases to ignore important gaps in the delivery of residents' care," said the member for Matapédia. 
The families and relatives of the seniors accommodated at the Chsld of Saint-Lambert-sur-Le-Golf who find skiing worries. "Families, members of the Coalition against the Montérégie PPPs and the Quebec Association of the Rights of Retired Persons and Pertracted people call for a coroner's investigation to shed light on deaths in obscure circumstances. It's not normal to have arrived there! The new PPP structure is the blind choice of a government that should have more interest and compassion for residents and who should want to avoid drags at all costs, "said the spokesperson for social services and elders, Danielle Doyer. 
"Today, on behalf of families who have lost a loved one in still nebulous circumstances, it is time for the Minister of Health to act. A real common front is training in Montérégie and we ask the Liberal government to move back and announce that the other three 66-seater projects are made in public mode. The Liberal government's strategy to leave our seniors "Aging at rebates" should stop immediately, "said Danielle Doyer and Dave Turcotte.
