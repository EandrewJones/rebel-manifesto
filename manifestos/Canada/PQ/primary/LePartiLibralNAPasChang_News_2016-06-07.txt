Quebec- reacting to the revelation of the Chief Electoral Officer (DGE) that the Liberal Party of Quebec refused, in May 2015, the reimbursement of illegal contributions, the member for Marie-Victorin and the Parliamentary Leader of the Official Opposition, Bernard Drainville, notes that nothing has changed to the Liberal Party since Philippe Couillard is at his head. 
Indeed, during the detailed study of Bill 101, law giving follow-up to the recommendations of the Charbonneau Commission in terms of political financing, the DGE indicated that the Liberal Party had refused in May 2015 to give it an illegal contribution as a result of a claim from him. 
"In the election campaign, in 2014, the Prime Minister promised us a deep renewal in terms of political financing, but it is clear that we are still in the presence of the good old Liberal Party," said Bernard Drainville. 
Recall that on September 17, 2013, following the announcement of a search for the Liberal Party, Philippe Couillard had indicated that he would fully assume his responsibilities with the DGE and that the reimbursement of sums illegally perceived could do part. 
"It is clear that the leader of the Liberal Party does not take his responsibilities and that there is still household to be done in the PLQ," concluded Bernard Drainville.
