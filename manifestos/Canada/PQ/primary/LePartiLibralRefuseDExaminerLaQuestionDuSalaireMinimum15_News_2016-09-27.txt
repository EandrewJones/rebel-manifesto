Quebec- The member for Richelieu and spokesperson for the Quebecois Party of Work, Sylvain Rochon, deplores the partisan decision of Liberal MPs, who rejected his application for the Committee on Economy and Labor to be seized of a mandate of initiative on the minimum wage. 
"On August 22 last, Prime Minister Philippe Couillard publicly stated that he wanted a debate on the minimum wage. Yet at the first opportunity, his deputies voted against our application for a mandate of initiative to that effect. It is totally inconsistent from them to refuse the debate that their own chief is openly demanding! First, "said Sylvain Rochon. 
"To rigorously assess the pace of increase of the minimum wage, you have to get out of the challenge of the partisan forums. However, the unfortunate decision of the Liberals deprives the members of an opportunity to hold public consultations on this complex file. The debate is already omnipresent, and all points of view must be heard. Why not study the file in parliamentary committee? Then questioned the hon. Member for Richelieu. 
"We wanted to see the Committee on the Economy and Labor seize our mandate, but Liberal members have invoked the need to wait for the conclusion of government reflections on poverty. But how does not think that the forum of the ideas for Quebec has, precisely, as the main objective of diverting our attention, and to put the discussion on the minimum wage with Greek calends? In addition to greatly sorry, the attitude of Liberal deputies surprises us; On other topics, such as social assistance, they do not hold in the same considerations. Their pretext does not hold the road. All they want is to save time, "concluded the spokesperson.
