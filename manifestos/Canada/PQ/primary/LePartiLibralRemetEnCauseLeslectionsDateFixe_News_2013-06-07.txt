Québec- pretending that the elections could possibly coincide with a religious holiday, the Liberal Party of Quebec refused, today, its consent for debate of UNEMOTION presented jointly to the National Assembly by the Minister responsible for democratic institutions and participation. Citizen, Bernard Drainville, the parliamentary leader of the second opposition group and deputy of Chauveau, Gérard Deltell, and the member for Mercier, Amir Khadir. This motion reaffirms that the choice of the date of the general election should not be done according to the calendar of religious festivals, but according to the general interest. 
"By refusing his consent, by refusing to vote for the motion, the Liberal Party clearly demonstrates that it does not agree to restore the election date. The general elections are a great democratic meeting that no Quebec citizen should miss. This is why the electoral law provides for ways of ensuring that all voters can exercise their right, whether anticipated, by postal vote or directly to the office of their returning officer. The date is not fixed according to the calendar of religious festivals, and should not be. We live in a society where the separation between religions and the state is a fundamental value, and we will not degrade on this principle on the issue of fixed date elections: it would send to all Quebeckers a very bad message, "has declared the minister. 
That's why Bernard Drainville, Gérard Deltell and Amir Khadir filed the following motion: 
"At the meeting of the Advisory Committee of the Chief Electoral Officer, who were used to establish the consensus of Political Parties on Law No.3, all parties had agreed on a date. It seems that for basic reasons, the Liberals have abandoned this beautiful consensus and are now trying to divide Quebeckers on the date of elections. Unfortunately, that's what their refusal confirms to support our motion today, "lamented Bernard Drainville
