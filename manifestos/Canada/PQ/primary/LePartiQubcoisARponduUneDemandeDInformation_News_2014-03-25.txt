Montreal- As part of its mission, UPAC has shown the wish to meet all political parties, including the Parti Québécois, informally. These meetings, at the request of the UPAC, had to remain confidential. 
Since the existence of this meeting was revealed to a medium, the Parti Québécois wishes to make public information on this subject, so as not to maintain confusion between the situation of the Liberal Party, which was searched, and that. From the Parti Québécois, to whom we have asked to explain its structure and its methods of financing. 
Last February, the Director General of the Parti Quebec, Sylvain Tanguay, and the Director of Finance and Administration, Pierre Séguin, informally met two sergeants investigating hammer squad. 
The investigators claimed to obtain, from all political parties, information about the funding of the party, its structure and its methods of financing. 
The Party Party representatives explained that its financing is provided by volunteers, that for each donation, a form was duly completed with all the information on the donor and a receipt was issued. It has also been confirmed that the volunteer ensures that all donations are made personal way. 
On the funding objectives, it was explained that they are based on the number of members in each constituency, and not on the basis of the fact that it is represented by a member of Parliament or a Quebec party minister. 
Remember that a complaint has been filed today by the Quebec Party with the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebecfin, which he investigates a funding activity that would have reported $ 428,000 to the Liberal Party, without it being published. in its financial report. This information was revealed following a search of UPAC at the registered office of the Liberal Party. 
The Québécois party has not been subjected to any search, did not have any other meeting with investigators and no documents were requested.
