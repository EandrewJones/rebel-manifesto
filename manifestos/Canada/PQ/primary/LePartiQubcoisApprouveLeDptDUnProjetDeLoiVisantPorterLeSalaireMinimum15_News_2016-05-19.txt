Quebec- The member for Richelieu and spokesman for the Quebecois Party of Work, Sylvain Rochon, and the member for Rousseau and the Finance Spokesperson, Nicolas Marceau, approve the study of a bill that would bring on the progressive enhancement of the minimum wage, until reaching a target of $ 15 an hour. 
"We support the new motion presented by Quebec Solidarity since it now proposes a bill that would set a target of $ 15 an hour for the minimum wage, as well as criteria for annual increase that would achieve this objective". , said Sylvain Rochon. 
The member for Richelieu also proposed an amendment to the motion presented by Quebec Solidarity so that "the National Assembly undertakes to study by the end of this Parliament a bill" to that effect. "The original text required a possible bill to be adopted by the end of this legislature but, as we face a majority Liberal government, we do not want to commit to a bill that parliamentarians. Never seen, "he said. 
"Our goal is obviously to offer the highest possible wage possible, to the extent that it does not translate into a decrease in the number of jobs available for workers. All and all are entitled to the best conditions and safe workplaces to contribute to our collective prosperity. We hope that as part of the filing of a bill, general consultations are held to hear stakeholders and experts from all sectors of the Company that would determine the criteria and pace of increase in salary Minimum most appropriate for fighting poverty and ensuring the growth of our economy, "says Nicolas Marceau. 
"By reducing disposable income, the Liberal government hardly affected women workers, as well as their families. That is why we ask that it reinvested in the various missions of the state and allow the parliamentarians to assess the possibility of up to $ 15 ", concluded the member for Rousseau.
