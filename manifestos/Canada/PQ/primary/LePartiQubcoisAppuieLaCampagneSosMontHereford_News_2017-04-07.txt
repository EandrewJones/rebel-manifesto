Québec- The spokesman for the Parti Québécois on the environment, the fight against climate change and responsible for the Estrie region, Sylvain Gaudreault, and the spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Sylvain Rochon, join their voice to the "SOS Mount Hereford" campaign and require the Northern Pass Pass of Hydro-Québec project to respect the integrity of the HEREFORD Community Forest, in the COATICOOK MRC. 
IN SHORT 
** - The route of the Quebec portion of the Northern Pass Pass of Hydro-Québec must respect the integrity of the HEREFORD Community Forest; 
"The HEREFORD Community Forest is one of the very few conservation media in the Estrie. It is a natural environment of great importance, both for its biodiversity and for the possibilities of ecotourism development it offers for the Coaticook MRC. The BAPE report clearly indicates that the trace of Hydro-Québec would cause significant damage to this protected territory and alternatives exist. The Quebec government must do everything to ensure the preservation of this single territory, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
"Quebeckers and Quebeckers can not accept that the Northern Pass line either buried nearly 97 km in the white mountains of New Hampshire, while on the Quebec side, we do not even take the trouble to protect the territory of Mount HEREFORD. Over a distance of 18 km. The difference in cost, for Hydro-Québec, would be about $ 70 million; It is barely 3% of the total project cost, estimated at $ 2 billion. The impact would be even the more minimal as because of the landfill on the American side, the line will already be limited to a level of tension and a longer life of what Hydro-Québec could have obtained. If the profitability of this electricity export project is only for this small difference, the government must bring Hydro-Québec back to order! "Required Sylvain Rochon.
