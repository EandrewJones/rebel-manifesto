Quebec, October 23, 2014 -The MP for Terrebonne and official opposition spokesman, Mathieu Traversy, is proud to announce that the Parti Québécois supports the "Always Fool of Our Children's Campaign? " Initiated by the Quebec Association of CEPs, this movement brings together citizens and organizations claiming the maintenance of the founding measures of Quebec family policy, including the development of CPE places, the Quebec Parental Insurance and Family Conciliation Regime- Work-studies. 
"We invite the people to participate in the Movement to signify the Liberal government of Philip Couillard its commitment to family policy and tell it that the measures that underpin themselves are very important, that they are progressive, and that they have promotes Quebec. The Minister of the Family, Francine Charbonneau, delayed the development of thousands of custody places very awaited by families. In addition, the government suggests the doubt and uncertainty about these services, not to want to cut in the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan. We are told that everything is on the table; It's very disturbing! "Said Mathieu Traversy. 
The member for Terrebonne recalls the positive effects of a strong family policy, both socially and economically. "Through this ambitious policy, Quebec has allowed parents to reconcile family life and work. Monoparecent mothers and fathers have improved their living conditions. Tens of thousands of women have acceded more quickly to the labor market. Funding child care and support for families, it is not an expense, it is an investment, it is a measure of economic development, "concluded Mathieu Traversy. 
The member also invites the population to sign the petition for the safeguarding of Quebec family policy it sponsors, through the website of the National Assembly: https: //www.assnat.qc.ca/en/exprimez -Your-opinion / petition / petition-4833 / index.html.
