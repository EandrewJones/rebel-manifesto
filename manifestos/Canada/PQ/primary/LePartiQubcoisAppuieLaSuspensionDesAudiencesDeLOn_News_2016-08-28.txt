Quebec, August 28, 2016 -The member for Sanguinet and spokesman of the Parti Québécois in the field of economy, energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, the member for Terrebonne and spokesperson in the field of environment and Fight against climate change, Mathieu Traversy, as well as the member for Verchères and spokesperson for Quebec-Canada relations, Stéphane Bergeron, support the application of the Mayor of Montreal, Denis Coderre, to suspend the hearings of the National Energy Board (NEB) About the Energy project is TransCanada. 
"In hiding the fact that Jean Charest looked at Ottawa on behalf of TransCanada, NEB's commissioners have lost all credibility to this federal agency. The evaluation process is visibly truffled with irregularities; What does Philippe Couillard wait to denounce them? Do the Liberals always share the secret activities of lobbying their former head? There is no other solution: The Government of Quebec must launch its own Energy Energy Assessment Process, "says Alain Therien. 
"Do not forget: this project is far from having won the part in terms of social acceptability. It involves huge environmental risks and security for Quebec. In return, the Quebec population will virtually any benefit; Energy is not even the goal of feeding it in oil! It is unthinkable that Quebeckers have no voice in a case as crucial for their collective future, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
"It has been demonstrated many times: we can not trust the NEB. Neither to carry out the evaluation exercise in any transparent or to take into account the interests of Quebeckers. In addition, we would see our territory at risk. This is why the ultimate decision about energy is must be taken by Quebeckers and by themselves, "summed up Stéphane Bergeron.
