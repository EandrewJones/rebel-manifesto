Quebec- The member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesman on sustainable development and environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, as well as the member for Gaspé and spokesperson for municipal affairs and regional development, Gaétan Lelièvre, claim from the Minister of the Environment, David Heurtel, which he entrusts BAPE a mandate in connection with the Haldimand oil project, in order to follow up on the demands of citizens and the city of Gaspé. 
Sylvain Gaudreault argues that the oil sector can not escape this citizen participation exercise. "In this area, many questions remain unanswered. What is happening with the specific Petrolia project is a taste of the questions to which the Minister of the Environment will, sooner or later, answer. We have to get the answers quickly and from a neutral organism, "he said. 
Recall that Lebilan of knowledge of the strategic environmental assessment throughout the hydrocarbon sector, published in March 2015, notably highlighted the multiple gaps of the Quebec legislative and regulatory framework, the impossibility of quantifying the overall impact of oil projects On GHG emissions, the insufficient level of preparation of municipalities to major accidents or spills, and lack of groundwater characterization. 
"The people of Gaspé measure more than anyone the possible consequences of oil projects on their quality of life, their supply of drinking water, public health and the environment. Subject the HALDIMAND project to BAPE would be a first for the oil sector in Quebec. There is a consensus between the citizens, the city of Gaspé and the company for a mandate to be given to that effect. If we want to gain the confidence of stakeholders, it takes independent data and an impartial supervision, "concluded the deputy of Gaspé.
