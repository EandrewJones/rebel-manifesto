The hon. Member for Sanguinet, Alain Therrien, as well as Mr. Guillaume Rousseau, candidate of the Quebecois Party in Sherbrooke, today met with Mr. Marc Dion and Me André Gauvin, respectively President and Vice-President of the Association the lawyers and notaries of the Quebec state (laneq). At the end of this meeting, the representatives of the Parti Québécois reiterated the support of their political training for the LANEQ claims. 
"The lawyers and notaries of the state play a vital role in a rule of law like Quebec. Moreover, the entire public service deserves respect and recognition. But, during the strike of the lawyers and notaries, the Liberal government served as agrogation and contempt, "Guillaume Rousseau said. 
Recall that LANEQ asked that the working conditions of its members be determined as a result of recommendations made by an independent compensation committee at the National Assembly, as is the case for their colleagues prosecutors with criminal prosecutions. 
"In my opinion, the main distinction between the Parti Québécois and some other parties is that we understand the importance of the public service expertise to carry out our commitments. This is the opposite of some of our political opponents, who do not show any embarrassment to despise the public service, "added Alain Therien.
