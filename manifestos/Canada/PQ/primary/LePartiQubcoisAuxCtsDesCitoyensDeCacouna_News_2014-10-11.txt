Quebec, October 11, 2014 - MPs from the Parti Québécois join the Citizen event against TransCanada's oil port today in Cacouna. The hon. Member for Rimouski, Harold Lebel, the member for Matane-Matapédia, Pascal Bérubé, the member for Vachon, Martine Ouellet, and the member for Berthier, André Villeneuve, are present alongside the public to tell the government to take his responsibilities . 
"The Liberal government must listen to the citizens present at this event. Drilling work must be suspended immediately. If even exploratory drilling, jeopardize a threatened species is that they just have to take place! We demand the immediate triggering of a BAPE to assess all the impacts of the Energy project, for CaCouna and for all Quebec, "said Sylvain Gaudreault, official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and 'environment. 
Harold Lebel welcomes the mobilization of Cacouna and Bas-Saint-Laurent citizens. "The people of our homes are very present for the preservation of our environment, our marine environment and the species that live there. The Minister of the Environment, David Heurtel, must take this into account, to stop being at the service of TransCanada to become the Minister of the people of Bas-Saint-Laurent and Quebec, "he added. 
The members present required from the Liberal government to stop improvising TransCanada. "All studies demonstrate the dangerous oil transportation on the St. Lawrence River. Municipalities are worried because they are not prepared to face a spill. We do not want Quebec to become a highway for Alberta oil, "they concluded. 
All official opposition members support the combat led by environmental groups, citizen groupings, elected officials and Quebeckers who ask the government to act urgently, by October 15, to stop the holding of Cacouna drilling.
