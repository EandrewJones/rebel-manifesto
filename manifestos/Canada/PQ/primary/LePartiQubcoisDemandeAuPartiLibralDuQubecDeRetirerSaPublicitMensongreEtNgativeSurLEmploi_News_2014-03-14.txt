Montréal - The Parti Québécois asks the Liberal Party of Quebec to withdraw its misleading and negative advertising on employment. 
The Quebec Institute of Statistics (ISQ) released final data on employment yesterday. In its balance sheet, the organization claims that 47,800 jobs were created in Quebec in 2013, the majority being full time. In its recently publicized publicity, the PLQ circulates erroneous data. He must therefore remove it. 
ISQ is a public, credible and neutral body. The data it publishes are the same ones who have been used for the economic forecasts of the Liberal Minister Raymond Bachand and all the former liberal ministers of the finances. By criticizing, yesterday, Philippe Couillard changes a recognized method of calculation, only to blacken the painting and alarm the population. 
Moreover, it is interesting to note that the Liberal leader confesses that he would not change the methods of calculating ISQ if he was brought to power.

Partician candidates are committed to creating jobs across Quebec. By the bold-boldpolitics he has put in place, the government of the Parti Québécois continues to support entrepreneurs, to encourage their succession, and to support companies in the social economy sectors and the environment. 
We have a plan and the team to succeed. Today, it's time to give us the means to go further.
