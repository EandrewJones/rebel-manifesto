Quebec, October 1, 2014 - The member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, asks Prime Minister Philippe Couillard to recall the Minister of Health and Social Services, Gaétan Barrette, for the remarks contemptuous he has held to parliamentarians of the official opposition and the former Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister Responsible for Elders, Réjean Hébert. 
"For two days, the Minister Barrette insults people who do not think like him. In particular, he accuses them of being liars. It was first Dave Turcotte, then Diane Lamarre, and now it's the tour of the former Minister of Health, Réjean Hébert. On the eve of his participation in the forum on the fight against intimidation, the Prime Minister must say that such remarks are unacceptable, especially from a member of his team. The inappropriate and intimidating comments of the minister must stop, "said Stéphane Bédard.
