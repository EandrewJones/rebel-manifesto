IN SHORT 
"In addition to Desjardins customers, there are thousands of other victims, including Revenu Québec and Capital One. Clearly, in recent months, more than half of Quebecers and Quebeckers have been affected by a data theft. The situation is exceptional, unprecedented. No one feels away from a possible leak. Everyone is worried. And the government would not feel arrested? Unthinkable, "said Martin Ouellet entry. 
"The CAQ government must go back to its decision, to open up and listen, and go quickly forward with the establishment of a parliamentary committee to deal with this issue, as we have Already claimed repeatedly, "he continued.

He demanded the holding of such a parliamentary committee, during which groups like Desjardins, Revenu Québec, Equifax and the Autorité des marchés financiers would be heard. 
"Once again, I insist: It's not about finding a culprit. Our request aims rather to give the right time to Quebeckers, and to define an action plan so that such situations do not arrive, added Martin Ouellet. In fact, I have already written to the Chairman of the Commission so that he emerged from our request, "he concluded.
