Quebec, on September 8, 2016 - Light of the revelations concerning the conflict of interest involving the company of Yvon Nadeau, a close to Minister Lessard, the member for Taschereau and spokesman for the Quebecois on ethics, Agnès Maltese, asks two investigations: one of the Commissioner for Ethics and Ethics, and one of the Commissioner of Lobbying. 
"Yvon Nadeau was always a political advisor at Minister Lessard's constituency office when the grant for his company, Pyrobiom Energies inc., Was solicited. The $ 3 million finally granted represent 40% of the costs of implementing the project to transformation of forest residues in biofuels by the company that Mr. Nadeau heads. This financial assistance represents, curiously, the maximum amount allowed by the Technoclimat program, from which the money comes from. It is a funny coincidence; There are serious questions about this grant, "said the spokesperson. 
"What is even more disturbing is the nature of the project, the transformation of forest residues; Laurent Lessard was at the same time Minister of Forests! Mr. Nadeau and Minister Lessard admit themselves to having discussed it, while the first is not registered in the lobbyist register. How did the Prime Minister have named the MTQ, the largest contractor of Quebec contracts, someone endowed with little judgment? How can we think there is no link between Mr. Nadeau's position and obtaining $ 3 million? "Sought Agnès Maltese. 
"Today, the Parti Québécois formulates two requests, one to the ethics commissioner and the ethics and one to the lobbyism commissioner, to investigate the process that led to obtaining the grant. Favoritism should never have its place in government; Yet a few months after their return to power, the Liberals had already handed his hands in the candy dish, "concluded the member for Taschereau.
