Quebec, October 16, 2014 - The member for Jonquière and the official opposition spokesman on sustainable development and the environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, again calls on the Minister of Sustainable Development, the Environment and the Fight Against climate change, David Heurtel, to revoke the certificate of authorization granted to TransCanada for Big Cacouna drilling work, as permitted by the Environmental Quality Act. 
The Québécois party regrets that Minister He Hréttel gives another chance to TransCanada to comply with the laws and regulations of the Ministry of the Environment. "The company has violated the main condition of the certificate of authorization granted in August by the Minister. TransCanada had until yesterday to comply with the law, which it did not do. After a succession of government coffering in this file and the interlocutory judgment of the Superior Court last September, there is no more defense possible for Minister Heurtel; It must immediately dismissed the certificate of authorization, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
The member for Jonquière also recalls that Friday, the Department sent two notices of non-compliance with the conditions of the certificate of authorization granted to TransCanada. "This is another passioning confession that the company does not care about environmental rules. For Minister Heurtel, this should be very serious. The noise level is what most affects belugas during work. If the company is not even able to comply with the certificate of authorization, the minister must revoke it immediately. Belugas, they will not have a second chance, "said Sylvain Gaudreault.
