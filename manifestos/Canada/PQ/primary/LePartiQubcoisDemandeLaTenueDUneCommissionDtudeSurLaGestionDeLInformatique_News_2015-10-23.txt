Quebec- The Quebec Party spokesman for the Treasury Board as well as in the area of information, economy, exports and pension plans, Alain Therrien, asks the Government to hold a Study Board on The management of the IT and the granting of contracts within the Quebec state. 
"Government's IT contracts are expensive to Quebeckers, and state managers are exceeded by the events. It takes a global diagnosis on what is wrong. That's why we are asking for the creation of an independent study commission, "said Alain Therrien. 
The study commission can be created by a simple decree of the government. The two most recent examples are the Coulombe Commission, on the forest, as well as the Pronovost Commission on Agriculture. "These two commissions have studied their sector independently and in depth. They had the power and mandate to re-evaluate the model in place, which the UPAC or the Auditor General can not do. The time has come to serve the same medicine in the IT sector in the Quebec state. Cost overruns, project management, private place, governance, free software place ... All these elements must be passed to the end comb and examined globally. The Commission will be able to make diagnoses, and propose appropriate remedies, "added the member for Sanguinet. 
"The future commission will also have to look at what is happening elsewhere, and propose new avenues for the Quebec state, because we need a change in culture, model and how to work with IT. The latter and all information technologies are and will remain essential; The state must be updated, "concluded Alain Therrien.
