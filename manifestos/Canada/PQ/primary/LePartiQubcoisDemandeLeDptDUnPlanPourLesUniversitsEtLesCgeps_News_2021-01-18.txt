Member for Bonaventure and spokesperson for the higher education, Sylvain Roy, ask the government to file a plan aimed at Guarantee the quality of teaching in higher education institutions.

IN SHORT 
-The Québécois party asks the Minister of Higher Education, Danielle McCann, to file a plan aimed at ensuring the quality of education in higher education institutions. 
-On notes no improvement in mental health assistance, more than two months after the announcement of new amounts supposed to improve it; The government has to accelerate the step to reduce the psychological distress of many students. 
-To counter the isolation of students, the Parti Québécois also asks Minister McCann to study the possibility of setting up hybrid classes, including the quick tests available. 
"While university courses have already begun and that the return to CEGEP is on our doorstep, the government gives the impression of having forgotten our young adults. There does not seem to be clear departmental guidelines to ensure a minimum threshold in the quality of education, and we have been brought about several issues related to it. For example, some students were only entitled to a PDF to complement all of their classes! First mentioned Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, who adds that teachers are also left to themselves, while teaching conditions have never been so difficult. "The government must give clear guidelines and offer more management," the leader of the Parti Québécois. 
In addition, the current situation leads to many psychological challenges. "Currently, 64% of college students say that their psychological health deteriorates. About 6% even evoke suicidal thoughts! We simply can not stay passive in front of such numbers. It's been two months since the government has announced new sums to improve mental health assistance, but nothing materialized on the ground until today. We do not even know when and how this help will come. In addition, yesterday's intervention by the Prime Minister left us more questions than answers. I ask him to listen to the cry of the heart of the students and to act immediately; We have long since exceeded the reflection stage, "continued Sylvain Roy 
"One of the problems often mentioned is isolation, chained Paul St-Pierre Plamondon; To counter it, one can think of setting up hybrid classes, as the student associations claimed. There are already more than two months, we asked Minister McCann if she had studied this possibility, and we are still waiting for the answer. With the arrival of fast tests, I reiterate our proposal to the government: it needs to evaluate this possibility, and that it displays all the necessary resources for it to be secure. »
