Quebec, December 1, 2016 -The Parti Party spokesperson in education, academic perseverance and literacy, Alexandre Cloutier, asks the Minister of Education, Sébastien Proulx, to set up a guaranteed threshold of Direct services to students attending public schools in Quebec, as part of the policy on the educational success it must submit soon. 
Alexandre Cloutier makes this request while national consultations on educational success take place today and tomorrow, in Quebec City. "Services for students in difficulty should no longer make the costs of government budget decisions from one year to the next. The Ministry of Education establishes a minimum number of teachers per student; If the government is serious in its desire to fight against school dropout, it should be the same for professionals who work with young people in difficulty, "he said. 
"The government's national consultations will be vain if they are not accompanied by concrete commitments on the financing and resources to meet the needs of students. The repeated cuts of the Liberal government provoked a shortage of resources in our schools. Situations are outright aberrants: ratios of a psychologist for 2600 students in Abitibi-Témiscamingue; 53% of risky students who do not have services in the Quebec City area, etc. It is high time that the Minister of Education Fixed Tags; A minimum threshold of students must be offered throughout the territory, "spokesman insisted. 
"This request is part of a series of Québécois party proposals to improve academic success: the deployment of 4-year-old kindergarten, the valuation of teachers and the improvement of their training, the introduction of a course to Quebec citizenship, Free school equipment and increased efforts to counter illiteracy, among others. It is essential that the issue of the "composition of the class" is the subject of the next policy of educational success, "concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
