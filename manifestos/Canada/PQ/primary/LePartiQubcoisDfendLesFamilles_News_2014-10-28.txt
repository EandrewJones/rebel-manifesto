Quebec, on October 28, 2014 - In a motion submitted today, the member for Terrebonne and official opposition on the family, Mathieu Traversy, asks the Liberal government to commit to maintaining financial support. Halts-Community Dayscare. 
"Community daycare halls welcome nearly 45,000 children each year. They help many families, often among the most vulnerable to our society. We share the concern of the Association of Quebec Community Dayscales and we deplore the lack of transparency of the government as well as the concern that it sows in all media, but especially in families, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
The motion adopted unanimously reads as follows: 
"That the National Assembly acknowledges the important work of community-day-board halls that meet a wide range of family and social realities and aim to support Quebec families; 
That it undertakes to maintain the financial support program for community day care and to ensure the sustainability of the funds enshrined. » 
The hon. Member recalls that the well-being of families has always been at the heart of the commitment of the Parti Québécois. Our Government was firmly committed to significantly enhanceing the funding of community organizations of $ 162 million, of which $ 5 million was intended for those working with families. Unfortunately, the Liberal government has decided to break with this commitment, ignoring the glaring needs of community organizations. 
"More than 200 organizations offer halt-daycare service to people who need them greatly. Among other things, these services allow parents to take training, seek employment, or newcomers to take francization courses and thus increase their integration capacity. Having voted in favor of the motion, the government must now spend the speech on acts and clearly support organizations, "concluded the member for Terrebonne.
