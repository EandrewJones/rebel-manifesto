Quebec- The member for Taschereau and the official opposition spokesman for the Capitale-Nationale, Agnès Maltese, denounces the decision authorized by the Liberal government to grant a 42% salary increase in the deputy of the Lieutenant. Governor of Quebec. 
"Through the Journalist Mathieu Boivin at FM 93, it was with amazement that I learned this morning that the follies at the office of the Lieutenant Governor are continuing. Obtaining a salary increase of 42% in a single shot by a decision of the Executive Board and the Treasury Board revolt any taxpayer, "lasted Agnès Maltese. 
The member for Taschereau does not come back that this decision, taken in 2009, was hidden by the Liberal Party government. "After the overwhelming report of the Auditor General in 2007 for the scandal under the reign of Lise Thibault with unjustified expenses of $ 700,000, Liberal members argued that transparency would apply from now on. They still failed their Word, "she added, also reminding that the Lieutenant-Governor himself, Pierre Duchesne, promised, during her swearing in 2007," transparency "and" sobriety ". 
"At the time of Lise Thibault, these follies were unbeknownst to everyone; This time, on the contrary, the Liberal government is complicit. It's shameful and revolting. I can not wait to hear the liberal justifications, "said Agnès Maltese. 
"The position of Lieutenant-Governor is archaic, it's time to put an end to it. The Quebec party challenges the Liberal Party of Quebec and asks him to end these follies, "concluded the member for Taschereau.
