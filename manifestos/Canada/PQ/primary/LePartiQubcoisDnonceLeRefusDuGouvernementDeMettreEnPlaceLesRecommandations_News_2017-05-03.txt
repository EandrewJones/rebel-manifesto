Quebec, May 3, 2017- In response to the categorical refusal of the Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, to follow up on the recommendations of the report on tax havens affecting the Caisse de Dépôt and Placement of Quebec (CDPQ), the Leader of the Opposition Official, Jean-François Lisée, and the spokesman for the Parti Québécois in the field of finance, Nicolas Marceau, denounced the lack of will and coherence of the government in this file. 
IN SHORT 
"When I asked it this week about the significant increase for the three years of the investments of the Fiscal Caisse in the tax havens - they went to $ 26.2 billion - the Prime Minister Disagree with this practice. But, during the study of the appropriations, the Minister of Finance, completely in addition to the opinion of his chief, refused to implement the report on tax havens, "lamented Jean-François Lisée. 
Indeed, Carlos Leitão refused to ask the Caisse to gradually reduce its investments in companies that make abusive tax avoidance or tax evasion, or to stop increasing them. "The Minister of Finance refused to respond to two of the unanimous recommendations specific to the fund contained in the report on tax havens. By the very fact, he endorses the vision expressed by the CEO of the Caisse and chooses the status quo. Nothing more will be done, while the processes in place have allowed investments of $ 26 billion in tax havens, "has denounced Nicolas Marceau. 
"Public services have difficulty financing themselves. States lose significant tax revenue. Quebec can and must play a leader role in the fight against tax havens, and follow the global movement in this direction. The Parti Québécois therefore wishes the implementation of all the recommendations of the report on tax havens, "concluded the leader of the Parti Québécois.
