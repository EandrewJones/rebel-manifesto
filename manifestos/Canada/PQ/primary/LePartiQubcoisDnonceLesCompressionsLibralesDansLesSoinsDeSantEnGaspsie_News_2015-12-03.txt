Québec- The hon. Member for Bonaventure, Sylvain Roy, said today to the National Assembly that more than 9500 people mobilized to denounce the effects of liberal austerity in Gaspésie. In the presence of the member for Taillon and spokesman of the Parti Québécois on health and accessibility to care, Diane Lamarre, he joined his voice to the initiator of a petition asking the Liberal government to cancel the cuts to maintain access to health care and their quality. 
"The Minister of Health can no longer claim that his Cups of $ 450 million this year in the network do not affect access to care and services. In Gaspésie, health austerity translates into cuts of $ 22 million. More concretely, they are 10 of the 24 surgery beds that were closed at Maria Hospital, and 12 auxiliary nursing positions that were cut off. At the residence Saint-Joseph, a post of auxiliary nurse was abolished. At the New Carlisle CHSLD, there is now only one day nurse to care for 72 residents in very heavy loss of autonomy, "said Sylvain Roy. 
"The minister is the only one to believe when he says that liberal cuts do not affect access to care. Here are other examples: the Mobile Breast Cancer Screening Service was abolished in Gaspésie, while it had allowed 355 women to have access to a screening test last year, and the urology service is found without a doctor and will no longer be available in the Bay-des-Chaleurs sector. The minister refused to guarantee citizens that these services will be restored and that the cups cease; It's unacceptable, "added Diane Lamarre. 
"While the Minister of Health gives hundreds of millions to his colleagues doctors, he cuts in essence, the health and safety of the Gaspesians. It's just dangerous, and it must stop! , Have concluded members.
