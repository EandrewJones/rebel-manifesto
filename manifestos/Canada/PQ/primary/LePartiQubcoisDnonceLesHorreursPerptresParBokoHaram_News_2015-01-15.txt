Quebec- The member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and sentence of the official opposition in terms of international relations and the status of women, Carole Poirier, firmly condemns terrorist acts perpetrated by the Boko Haram group and wants the governments of the world, Especially those in Quebec and Canada, pay more attention to these unacceptable gestures. 
"On January 3rd, the terrorist group has shaved several villages in northeastern Nigeria, killing a large number of people. According to Amnesty International, it is the most important and destructive offensive of the Group since the Islamist insurrection in 2009. To this, we must add the many kidnappings and attacks, as well as all the destruction that Boko Haram has left behind him in recent years. This situation exceeds any understanding. The international community must seriously focus on this large-scale humanitarian drama, "said Carole Poirier. 
The hon. Member adds that unfortunately women are used by Boko Haram as weapons of war. "Not only does the group reject education for girls, it has also carried out several important kidnappings. More abominable, girls, ages only 10, are used as human bombs. This new climbing in the horror must be strongly denounced, just like Boko Haram's terrorist acts, "she concluded.
