Quebec- The member for Taschereau and official opposition on secularism, Agnès Maltais, as well as the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, denounce the words of the Imam Hamza Chaoui and want the authorities to do the necessary to prevent the next opening, in Montreal, from a community center led by it. 
"The Imam Hamza Chaoui held, in the past, radical remarks; He said, in particular, that democracy and Islam are not compatible, and that the vote is a sin. We strongly denounce these medieval remarks, "said Agnès Maltais. 
"I support the municipal authorities in their approach to verifying the compatibility of a community center led by this Imam with the environment. Its remarks on the place that women and homosexuals should be occupied in our society are incompatible with our values, especially with the absolute, equality of men and women, "added, for his part, Carole Poirier. 
The boundaries of "logic" couillard 
The case of Hamza Chaoui illustrates the limits of the reasoning of Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, who considers that fundamentalism is a "personal choice" like the others. "For the Prime Minister, is it acceptable for an individual to comment and promote discriminatory and undemocratic values? Asked Agnès Maltese.
