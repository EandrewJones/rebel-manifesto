Quebec- The member for Rousseau and the official opposition for the finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, announces that he will submit a bill soon to create a position as Parliamentary Budget Director (Dpb). 
"It is a proposal to strengthen citizens' confidence in their institutions. Out of any partisan, the DPB will be able to analyze the government's financial situation and give an independent report. This bill also aims to improve access to information for the population and a better understanding of public finance issues. We also propose a DPB validation mechanism that will allow citizens to know if the electoral commitments of political parties are credible, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
The three general mandates of the DPB will be: 
"An independent expert may produce a report on public finances at regular intervals, as can be published a pre-election ratio of the budget situation of Quebec. Thus, political parties will have the same information on which to base their electoral platform, and voters can make their choice in the most enlightened way possible, "added the member for Rousseau. 
A parliamentary director of the budget instead of the Auditor General (VG) 
The hon. Member also states that this proposal goes further than that of the Government inserted in Bill 28, which confides only the realization of a pre-election report at the VG. "For us, it is the DPB that should be responsible for it, in addition to the mandates that are proposed. The VG has the mission of compliance, not the forecasts. The expertise necessary for the realization of these two mandates is not the same. The DPB will be responsible for forecasts for the current year and for the future. Like other legislatures around the world, Quebec must have a parliamentary director of the budget, an independent expert who can improve public information about the financial situation. The ultimate goal is that the state is more transparent, "concluded Nicolas Marceau.
