Quebec- The member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson in ethics and integrity, Stéphane Bergeron, introduced today a bill to put an end to the granting of a bonus to the resigning members. He asks the Government to grab it quickly, so that the damaging situations, like the one lived during the departure of Yves Bolduc cease. 
"The departure of Yves Bolduc has eloquently demonstrated the need to end, permanently, to this practice, which consists, for a member who has broken up and obtained a democratic mandate, to pocket a premium if he decides Do not carry out this term. Our fellow citizens disapprove massively this behavior, which obviously contributes to growing cynicism in our society, "said Stéphane Bergeron. 
It should be remembered that it is the third time in two years that a Liberal Member leaves during the mandate by placing his transition allowance, whereas Zakaïb, of the Parti Québécois, and that Christian Dubé, of the CAQ, renounced . "The Liberal government tries to divert the scandalous behavior of its former deputies by waving the Happy Dubé report, which also contains a multitude of other recommendations. This is clearly a maneuver to avoid tackling without delay with the main problem, that of the unduly affected departure bonuses affected by the resigning members of the Liberal Party. There is urgency to act, "continue the member for Verchères. 
"The bill we presented today is simple, clear and concise. It can easily be adopted in a very short time if the government has the will. We offer the Prime Minister the opportunity to show leadership and coherence with the remarks he has barely just a few weeks ago; I do not dare doubt that he will seize her, "concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
