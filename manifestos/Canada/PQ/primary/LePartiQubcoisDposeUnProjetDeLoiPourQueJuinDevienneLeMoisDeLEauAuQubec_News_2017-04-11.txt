Qu√©bec- giving following the commitment of the Quebecois party on the occasion of World Water Day, the Environmental and Climate Change Fighting Spokesperson, Sylvain Gaudreault, deposits the Bill 795 proclaiming June the month of water. 
IN SHORT 
"Water, Quebec, is a symbol of life, culture, development, pleasure and health. By its abundance and accessibility, it is also a guarantee of our quality of life. But let's not forget that water is also a vulnerable and exhaustible resource, and is increasingly subject to human pressures: pesticides, industrial discharges, municipal wastewater spills, unbridled water consumption drinking, hydrocarbon spills, climate change, etc. , "Said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
The spokesperson therefore wishes, through his bill, encourage the population to make a more responsible use of water. "Any change in behavior first goes through information and awareness. That's why we believe in the importance of sensitizing and educating Quebeckers in water issues, "he explained. 
"I invite the Minister of the Environment, David Heurtel, as well as all members of the National Assembly to support Bill 795 to be adopted by the end of this parliamentary session" , concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
