Quebec- The hon. Member for Taschereau, a parliamentary leader of the official opposition and spokesperson in secularism, Agnès Maltese, tabled a draft law on the observer of religious fundamentalism. 
"The observer will have the mission to identify and document the manifestations of religious fundamentalism in Quebec, with the aim of preventing radicalization, including that of our young people. It will also be mandated to study phenomena and issues such as religious accommodations, religious neutrality, state secularity and intolerance to religious minorities, often the first victims of fundamentalism. To do this, the observer will conduct research. He will also have investigative powers. Its mandate will look like, in this sense, to that of the Protecteur du citoyen; He writes reports and makes recommendations to parliamentarians, who have said Agnès Maltais. 
The observer will report to the National Assembly. He will be appointed two-thirds of the votes of deputies. The observer will report on his activities, and the bill provides that the members of the National Assembly will have to seize these reports. 
"The observer will allow elected officials of the National Assembly to have a clear and complete portrait of the issue of religious fundamentalism such as the Bouchard-Taylor Commission defined it. In our view, this is necessary if you want to choose the best methods to prevent the radicalization of individuals at risk and protect the communities of stigma. Independent experts, like those participating in the observatory on radicalization and violent extremism, announced yesterday, will thus be able to obtain mandates of the observer to better understand religious fundamentalism, document it and prevent it, "concluded Agnès Maltese.
