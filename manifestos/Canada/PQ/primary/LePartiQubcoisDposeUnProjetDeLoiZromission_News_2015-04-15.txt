Quebec- The member for Vachon and sentence of the official opposition in the field of transportation of transport, Martine Ouellet, introduced this morning to the National Assembly, Bill 392, law on motor vehicles at Zero greenhouse gas emissions, which is intended to improve the supply of electric vehicles in the Quebec market and, in doing so, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
"Automotive manufacturers need to increase the supply of electric vehicles, including Quebec consumers a wider range of models. Given the weakness of the current offer, sales of electric vehicles account for more than 0.5% of all car sales in Quebec. If adopted, our bill will position Quebec as a leader in electric mobility, "said Martine Ouellet. 
Ten US states, representing more than 28% of the United States automotive market have already adopted a zero emission law, including California and New York. These states can therefore benefit from a better offer in electric vehicles and a better environment. 
"The transportation sector is responsible for 45% of greenhouse gas emissions in Quebec. Transport electrification is essential if we want to release Quebec oil and fight climate change. When we were in the government, we filed an ambitious transportation strategy for transport; Unfortunately, the Liberals are abandoning it, "says Sylvain Gaudreault, official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and environment. 
"In terms of cost of use, the owners of an electric vehicle save up to 85% compared to the owners of a gasoline vehicle. In addition, rather than using oil imported at great expenses from abroad, they buy Quebec green electricity; The economies thus realized can be invested locally and, therefore, create wealth in Quebec, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
