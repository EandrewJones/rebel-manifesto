Quebec, October 21, 2014 -The MP for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson in ethics and integrity, Stéphane Bergeron, said today to the National Assembly a motion requesting the abolition of the Physician premium program for patient care. 
"For lack of time, at its General Council, the Liberal Party has only been able to take a position on a resolution from Montérégie-Center activists, elsewhere Region of the Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette. The resolution requested the abolition of the physician premium program. Today we give the opportunity to the liberal parliamentary wing to make known its position in this regard, "said Stéphane Bergeron. 
The motion reads as follows: 
"That the National Assembly calls for the abolition of the premium program for physicians for the care of patients, as proposed by the Regional Mountérégie-Center Regional Policy Commission of the Quebec Liberal Party. » 
Refund or resignation  The hon. Member further reiterates that Minister Yves Bolduc has the choice: reimburse all of his $ 215,000 premium or resign from his position. 
"Yves Bolduc has withdrawn $ 215,000 from a program that he had himself put in place, while diverting the very spirit of the premium. Indeed, while it aims to encourage family physicians to take more patients in charge, the minister has abandoned hundreds. This is unacceptable! ", Concluded the member. 
Remember that the liberal parliamentary wing had also defended the payment of premiums to Dr. Bolduc without a vote on a motion of the pet opposition on September 17th.
