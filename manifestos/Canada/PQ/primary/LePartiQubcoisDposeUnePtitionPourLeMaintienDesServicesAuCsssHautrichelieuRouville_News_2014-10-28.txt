Quebec, October 28, 2014 -The Member of Saint-Jean, Dave Turcotte, and the member for Taillon and the official opposition to the health and accessibility of care, Diane Lamarre, ask the Minister of the Health and Social Services, Gaétan Barrette, to finally listen to the citizens of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, who signed a petition to seek the revision of the cutting plan and the cancellation of position cuts at the CSSS High-Richelieu -Rouville. At a press point on this subject today, the members were accompanied by Ms. Line Larocque, the first Vice-Chair of the Quebec Interprofessional Health Federation (FIQ), and Ms. Sylvie Jovin, President of the Union. High-Richelieu-Rouville health professionals (FIQ).

"What the minister calls for reorganization turns out to service cuts. In fact, it is subject to the citizens of Montérégie, and more specifically to those of the High Richelieu, the consequences of liberal austerity. At home, it is 82 professional positions that are cut, in addition to closing 8 beds within the pediatric unit, 32 beds at the medical unit and 2 intensive care beds. These cups will directly affect the services to the population, the quality of care as well as the level of safety in which they are exempt, "said the member for Saint John.

The member for Taillon reminds his side that even if Minister Gaétan Barrette has repeatedly affirmed that the cuts imposed by his government in the health network would not affect care and services, obviously, that is not what Go on the ground.

" This is unacceptable. It is not listening to the population and continues to ignore the events that take place every week at the four corners of Quebec to denounce liberal cuts and austerity. The members of the Parti Québécois support the citizens of Upper Richelieu and ask the Minister to cancel these cups, as he canceled those in intellectual disabilities in Montreal two weeks ago, "added Diane Lamarre.
