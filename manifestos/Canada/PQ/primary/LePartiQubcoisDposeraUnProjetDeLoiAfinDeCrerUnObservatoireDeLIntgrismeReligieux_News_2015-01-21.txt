Quebec- The member for Taschereau, the official leader of the official opposition and spokesperson in secularism, Agnès Maltais, announces that the Parti Québécois will deposit, at the beginning of the parliamentary school, a bill proposing the creation of an observatory of religious fundamentalism. 
"We suggest an observatory to have a clear and complete portrait of the issue of religious fundamentalism. In our view, this is necessary to prevent the radicalization of individuals at risk and to protect the communities of stigma. Independent experts will thus be able to obtain data to better understand religious fundamentalism, document it and prevent it. Prime Minister Philippe Couillard himself proposed to treat religious fundamentalism and the neutrality of the state separately; By depositing this bill, we take it to the word. Our intention to discuss this issue is known to all, and it is now the government to hear our appeal, "said Agnès Maltais. 
In addition, in terms of education, the Caucus of the Parti Québécois members formulated two requests to the Government: 
Finally, the official opposition claims the deposit, as soon as possible, of a bill on the religious neutrality of the state and equality between men and women. 
"Obviously, the question of the religious neutrality of the state causes a significant discomfort within the government, especially for Philippe Couillard. However, the latter must fulfill its election promise and make a proposal to ensure respect, in Quebec, as well as that of equality between men and women, "said Agnès Maltese.
