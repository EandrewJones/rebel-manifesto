Québec- The spokesman for the Parti Québécois family, Sylvain Pagé, participated this morning at a great human chain in support of the CPE of the Mont-Laurier region. He replied at the invitation of the CPE La Fourmilière and CEP Les Vers to Cabbage, who organized this mobilization activity to denounce the impact of cuts of $ 120 million that will fall on CPE this year. 
"With the arrival of a new minister to the family, we would have expected more listening, more open. Now, unfortunately, Sébastien Proulx serves us the same cassette as his predecessor. If the minister is really listening to parents and educators, as he claims, well, that he proves it by renouncing the $ 120 million cuts that his government wants to do in the network, "said Sylvain Pagé . 
"By cutting in the CPEs, the minister mental equal opportunities. He abandons children, families and educators across Quebec. It has sacrificed a network that has been proven for years and has allowed thousands of mothers to integrate the labor market with thousands of children with special needs to have a day care center, "added the spokesperson. 
"The Minister of Family must give the CPE to continue their educational, screening and prevention mission. As for the Parti Québécois, we will continue to fight alongside parents and educators. With the new "Family Tax", for which parents will have to pay up to $ 2300 per child when producing their tax return, next month, we understand that the new vision of the Liberal government is "pay more for less services ". Indecent! "Concluded Sylvain Pagé.
