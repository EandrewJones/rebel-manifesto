Quebec-sensitive to the tragedy of couples when the death of a baby comes before the end of a pregnancy, the member for Iberville and the official opposition on the family, Marie Bouille, and the member D'Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Carole Poirier, demonstrate opening to provide a solution for the father to be entitled to a treatment equivalent to that of the mother in such circumstance. 
A petition containing the signing of more than 12,000 people asking for paternity leave to be enhanced during a perinatal mourning was filed at the National Assembly today by the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. 
"Thanks to Marie-Pierre Dubé and Kunthy Chhim, citizens of my riding, I learned a few weeks ago that neither the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan nor the Labor Standards Act provided adequate measures to allow Couples to benefit from a common respite time to live the mourning of a child. This situation deeply touched me, "said Carole Poirier, explaining why she had agreed to file this petition. 
Indeed, although maternity leave is planned for mothers, it is only a few days without pay that are currently granted to fathers. "The unexpected and unwanted end of a pregnancy is a disturbing event that affects as much the father as the mother. The two couple members should be entitled to a period of adequate respite to live their mourning, "added Marie Bouillé. 
The Parti Québécois is committed to finding a solution to correct this situation if it is worn in power during the next election.
