Quebec- The member for Rosemont and Quebec's Word of Party in social services, youth protection, home care and prevention, Jean-François Lisée, is pleased that the Liberal government has announced aid parents of children heavily disabled. 
"The few mothers who, for months, have been carrying the demands of thousands of families with a handicapped child deserve our hat. I am pleased that their steps, combined with our repeated interventions with the ministers barrette and Charlebois in the National Assembly, finally give concrete results and hope to hope for an improvement in their situation. We invest every day for citizens, for parents, for families, and this decline of the Liberal government, who had stubbornly refusing to help those mothers and their children, would greatly rejoice, "said Jean-François Listed. 
"Recall that after Minister Lucie Charlebois has meant to the mothers they never gain cause, it was his colleague Gaétan barrette who had to take over and work to find a path. After it publicly declared that mothers' requests would cost him 42 billion and ridiculous their claims and their situation, we are reassured today to see that he found the reason. Now hope that this gesture is not the only one that Gaétan Barrette will do to meet the growing needs for home care and intermediate resources, "concluded the member for Rosemont.
