Montreal- Following his comments comparing Pierre Karl Péladeau at the coming of Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran, the Parti Québécois requires the candidate of Quebec Solidarity in Mercier, Amir Khadir, which he publicly apologized for his incendiary, lie and irresponsible words. 
The Parti Québécois also asks Françoise David to dissociate himself from the words of his candidate and to remind him to order. 
Indeed, in a report on the emission on the 15-18 of the first channel of Radio-Canada, Amir Khadir compares the arrival of Pierre Karl Péladeau to the Parti Québécois at the Alliance of the left and the right Iranian right which aimed to overthrow the American guardianship and carry the Ayatollah Khomeini at the head of the country. However, the Iranian Revolution, it must be recalled, concluded by the establishment of a dictatorial regime in which individual freedoms were flouted continuously. 
By his words, Amir Khadir discreeds, as well as his party.
