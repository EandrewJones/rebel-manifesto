Quebec, on September 24, 2015 -The Member of Quéillé and spokesman for the health and accessibility of care, Diane Lamarre, strongly denounces the intention of the Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette, to legalize the Taxation of overloads to patients, through a simple amendment to Bill 20. It requires the end of all incidental costs. 
"The minister must ensure free and universality of health care by definitively eliminating all incidental fees. Quebecers and Quebeckers do not have to pay a second time for services covered by the Health Insurance Act, "said Diane Lamarre. 
"Doctors were entitled to carentous increases in their remuneration from the Liberals, bringing it up from 2.9 to 6.8 billion $ between 2003 and 2015. The ancillary costs, often unexpected, should not be paid. by patients; They should be fully covered by the envelopes allocated to doctors who, remember, total nearly $ 7 billion. Only 1% of physician remuneration is needed to cover all of which is surfactured at this time to patients. We have a universal public health system. This means that when a patient will see a doctor, he uses his health insurance card, no credit card, "said Diane Lamarre. "Gaétan barrettes the minister protects what Gaétan barrettes the negotiator negotiated when he was at the FMSQ bar," she added. 
The minister tries to quickly settle the question by an amendment to Bill 20. "He acts sneaky. None of the 46 groups coming into consultation on Bill 20, last March, could not speak on this approach to paying the costs incidental to patients, since the bill did not mention it. The minister is rather to legalize the illegal, "concluded the hon. Member.
