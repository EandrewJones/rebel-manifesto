Gaspé, July 27, 2020- The hon. Member for Gaspé, Megan Perry Melançon, made another general appeal to civility with holidaymakers who choose the Gaspé Peninsula this summer. In recent weeks, there has been a massive arrival of tourists without reservations that occupy unmanaged spaces for camping. This situation causes the problems of safety, coexistence with the citizens of the region and the rallies too tight during the pandemic period. The hon. Member thus makes three requests to the Quebec government to try to regularize the situation: 
- a visit from the Minister of Public Safety in Gaspesian territory to appeal to civility and recall the rules; 
- a special budget to find more Québec safety patrollers for the summer season, allow hiring by the most targeted municipalities of security agents and increase the display of municipal regulations; 
- Special monitoring of the beaches to prevent them from transforming into place. 
Quebec must provide formal support to send a strong message to faulty tourists. We therefore ask to concretely support the municipalities to implement the regulations in force. The challenge is important, the tourist season will continue for several weeks and the local means are too limited to enable us to enforce our territory. 
"Our region is one of the most beautiful in the world and we are always happy to have it discovered at tourists everywhere. However, this year we live an unprecedented situation that requires us to intervene. In addition to making cohabitation difficult with the fragile ecosystems of the beaches of the Gaspésie, we find ourselves with public places filled with dirt that come to ruin our beautiful landscapes. This situation must be taken seriously by Quebec, "says the Gaspésian elected. 
It recalls that the tourism industry is of great importance for the Gaspé economy. "This is a wealth of living on such a beautiful territory and we share it with all of our Quebec compatriots. By recalling the rules of respect for the territory and its inhabitants, we honor our region. Everyone wins, but everyone has to put it from his ".
