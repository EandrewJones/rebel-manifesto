Quebec, on November 12, 2019 - Member of Parliament for Gaspé and spokesman for Immigration, Méganne Perry Melançon, proposed today, at the question period, a concrete solution to the government to improve the program. Quebec experience (PEQ). In his view, after the decline in the Prime Minister in Simon Jolin-Barrette, the government must now seek to improve the PEQ, rather than restrict the scope. 
IN SHORT 
· The government must seek ways to improve the PEQ, instead of imposing restrictions; One solution would be to expand its reach to DEP. 
· Often eligible students are already perfectly integrated and want to stay in the region. 
· The PEQ can and must become the tool par excellence of regionalization of immigration. 
"Friday, the Prime Minister put an end to the CAQ caduillage week about the PEQ. Now we have to look at how the program can be improved. I propose to the government a simple and ideal solution: remove the planned restrictions, and expand the PEQ to professional studies, DEPs, "proposed Megan Perry Melançon. 
According to the Québécois Party, Jolin-Barrette reform was a mistake as a whole, especially for remote areas. "ELP students are the best immigration candidates that we can hope for: they are trained, speak French, are already integrated and often wish to settle in the region," continued the spokesperson. 
The Minister of Immigration, Francization and Integration, Simon Jolin-Barrette, indicated wanting to regionalize immigration by framing newcomers with officials. "Without it a bad thing in itself, in terms of integration, the supervision by an official is significantly less effective. The minister must understand that it's easier, more efficient and economical to welcome a person who is already integrated into his community. Moreover, it must absolutely make the PEQ the cornerstone of its regionalization plan of immigration; In the absence of what, this one will be a bitting failure, "concluded the member.
