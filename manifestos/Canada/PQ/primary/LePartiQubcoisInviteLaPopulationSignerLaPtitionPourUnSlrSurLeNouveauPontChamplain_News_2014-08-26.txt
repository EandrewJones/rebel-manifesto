Quebec- The member for Vachon and sentence of the official opposition in terms of transport, electrification of transport and maritime strategy, Martine Ouellet, and the member for Rosemont and spokesperson for the metropolis, Jean-François Lisée , invite citizens to sign the petition asking the Quebec government to take a position in favor of a lightweight rail system (SLR) as a collective mode of transport on the new Champlain bridge. This is available on the website of the National Assembly. 
"In the spring, the Minister of Transport, Robert Poëti, started a step by step into the file and denied the liberal commitment to a SLR. By doing so, it goes against the consensus of the many elected representatives of the South Shore and Montreal, "said Martine Ouellet. 
"Citizen mobilization remains essential to safeguard this important project for the metropolis and the South Shore. I invite the population to sign this petition in many large numbers, "added Jean-François Lisée. 
Remember that a report by the AECOM firm, commissioned by the Metropolitan Transportation Agency, confirms that the SLR is the only means of transport that will meet the needs after 2021, thus upgrading rapid bus systems. Despite several requests from the Parti Québécois, Minister Poëti still refuses to make this study public. 
Citizens have until November 22, 2014 to sign the petition at: assnat.qc.ca/en/exprimez-your-opinion/petition/petition-4793/index.html.
