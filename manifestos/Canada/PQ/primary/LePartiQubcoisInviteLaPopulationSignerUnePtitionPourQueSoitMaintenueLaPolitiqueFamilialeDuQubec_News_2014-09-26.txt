Quebec- The member for Terrebonne and official opposition on the family, Mathieu Traversy, invites the population to sign in large numbers a petition to maintain the family policy of Quebec, an initiative of the Quebec association Early childhood centers (AQCPE) sponsor the member. 
"One may wonder what Quebec families have made the Liberal government so that it is happening at this point. The cuts of his austerity policy hurt families. The Minister of the Family, Francine Charbonneau, first delayed the development of thousands of custody places. The government is also planning on a "family tax", through which the middle class will pay even more. As if it were not enough, he also wants to put the ax in parental insurance, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
The hon. Member recalls that our family policy is an important gem to preserve, for the economic and social development of Quebec. 
"These are progressive social measures that advanced Quebec. They are essential elements for the development of our society, capital support for young families, and there is no question of dismantling them on behalf of a short-view accounting year. By providing support to young parents, we allow them to better reconcile family life and work, to participate fully in society, "concluded Mathieu Traversy. 
The petition is posted on the website of the National Assembly, at addressHTTPS: //www.assnat.qc.ca/en/exprimez-your-opinion/petition/petition-4833/index.html
