Quebec, August 15, 2014 -The Parti Québécois invites the Minister Delegate to Public Health, Lucie Charlebois, to support the proposal to make the nutrition information mandatory in the rapid catering chains. The member for Rosemont and sentence of the official opposition in the field of prevention, Jean? François Lisée, and the member for Labelle and spokesperson in saline lifestyle, Sylvain Pagé, want this idea to be translated into action. 
On the one hand, the clarity and consistency of nutritional display throughout Québec would allow consumers of fast food chains to make more informed choices about the risks of certain health foods. On the other hand, changes in food behaviors, resulting from a mandatory display of this information, may hire Quebecers in healthy lifestyle habits. 
Remember that the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Yves Bolduc, committed last June to present very soon a national sport, leisure and physical activity. He also wishes to continue the target of the Quebecois party to make Quebec one of the world's most fit nations within 10 years. 
"This is the ideal opportunity for his colleague Lucie Charlebois to give the future policy a cross-cutting application, by adopting this measure of promoting healthy lifestyle," said Sylvain Pagé. 
"The government has to move forward with concrete measures to prevent health risks related to junk food. It is time to give a real impetus to this ambition to equip Quebec from a national health prevention policy, "said Jean? François Lisée.
