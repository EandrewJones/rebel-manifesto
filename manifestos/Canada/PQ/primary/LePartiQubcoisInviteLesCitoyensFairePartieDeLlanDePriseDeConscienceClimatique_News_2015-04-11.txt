Québec- On the sidelines for its participation and that of several other members of the Parti Québécois in the Marche Action Marche, the member for Jonquière and the official opposition spokeswoman in sustainable development and environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, invites Quebeckers to massively support the fight against climate change and the ecological transition of Quebec to renewable energies. 
"The message that will be sent by Quebeckers in the capital today is very clear: yes to the protection of climate and renewable energies, and not to the TransCanada pipeline project and oil from oil sands! We fully support the citizens in their approach, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
People have been mobilizing for several years to counter the exploitation of shale gas in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. "Quebeckers have shown an extraordinary solidarity when it was a question of blocking the shale gas road. I invite each of them to continue mobilization and to aim more broadly the preservation of our climate, "added the member for Jonquière. 
The Parti Québécois also recalls that independent Quebec would be stronger and better equipped to combat climate change. "As long as we are a province, projects like TransCanada's energy pipeline will try to make Quebec a highway for Alberta oil. It is therefore necessary to be able to make our own choices, and that is why we tabled Bill 390, aimed at asserting the primacy of the competence of Quebec on the environment, "concluded Sylvain Gaudreault. .
