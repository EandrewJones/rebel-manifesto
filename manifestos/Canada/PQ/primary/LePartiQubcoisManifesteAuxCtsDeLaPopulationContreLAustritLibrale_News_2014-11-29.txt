Quebec- The hon. Member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, participates with many MPs at the March against the austerity today in Quebec City. Many of his members' colleagues from the Parti Québécois do the same in Montreal. 
"The government has only austerity to offer Quebecers. The liberal effect is the loss of 82,000 full-time jobs since April. This government does not have an economic development policy to stimulate employment. He cut into the resources dedicated to the socio-economic development of the regions, the CLDs. It offers a health network reform that will not improve patient access or care. It will rather paralyze the network for years, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
"Today, the members of the Parti Québécois are on the street with the population to tell the Liberal government of Philippe Couillard that austerity does not pass. The measures it sets up tackle families, regions and workers. Philippe Couillard has lied to the population, in the election campaign, when he said he would develop the child care network and limit the increase in tariffs to index. However, it has modulated the rates and brake the creation of places expected by parents throughout Quebec. Quebec families are disappointed with these broken and worried promises for the future, "added the leader of the official opposition. 
"Nous Style and Minister's miniinter's son Weather in Mené Self in Brisé And The Manorized Hearing It Pofiine; to liu, maintenant de méparier les dégâts », a conclus Stephane bédard.
