Longueuil- After consultation with the Executive Committee of the Pinière, the Directorate General of the Parti Québécois announces that the Parti Québécois will not present a candidate in this constituency in order to promote the re-election of the independent candidate Fatima Houda-Pepin. 
The Charter of Laity is a central legislative piece for the Parti Québécois. A next government of the Parti Québécois is committed to depositing the Charter of Laity and equality between men and women to finally be adopted. 
"It's a reflected decision that we have reached. The courage and commitment of Fatima Houda-Pepin in the debate on the Charter is all the honor. I want to emphasize its perseverance in the fight against religious fundamentalism, "said Bernard Drainville, Quebec's candidate in Marie-Victorin and Minister responsible for democratic institutions and citizen participation. 
Remember that Ms. Houda-Pepin was expelled from the Liberal caucus because she supported a more rigorous defense of the principles of religious neutrality of the state, contrary to the position of status quo defended by Philippe Couillard. Moreover, the Parti Québécois was inspired by the work and ideas of Fatima Houda-Pepin to integrate in its platform on the establishment of a research center on so-called crimes and the fight against fundamentalism. 
"It's not an easy fight that the candidate in the Pinière has undertaken. She defends with courage and dedication the values of equality man-wife and the institution of the state to which a large majority of Quebecers adhere. On behalf of the Québécois Party, I wish him the best chance, "said Drainville.
