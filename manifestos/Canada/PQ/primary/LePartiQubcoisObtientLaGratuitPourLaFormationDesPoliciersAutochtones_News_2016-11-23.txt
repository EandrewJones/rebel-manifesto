Quebec- Alexandre Cloutier, spokesman for the Parti Education, School Perseverance, Aboriginal Affairs and Nordic Communities, is pleased to have obtained the Government the assurance that it will reimburse, in the future , the costs associated with the training of Aboriginal police officers. 
Recall that in recent years, students enrolled in the Certificate of College Studies (AEC) in Police Techniques (First Nations) had to pay an admission fee of $ 17,500, plus a $ 34,000 bill. moment of registration at the National Police School of Quebec. 
"Aboriginal students had to pay more than $ 50,000 for training in police technology. Nor, neither the minister responsible for higher education nor the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs were informed. I had to ask the National Assembly a question for the government to be interested in the training of aboriginal police, "said the spokesperson. 
It is indeed thanks to this question asked in the House last Thursday that the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs has announced today that he would correct the situation. Finally, accessibility to the AEC in police techniques for Aboriginal youth will be guaranteed. 
"It is still amazing to see that the government was not even aware of the sums that these students had to pay, while for a year, we have only talked about the relations between police bodies and indigenous communities. If we did not intervene, the Liberals would probably have let this situation persist. The formation of aboriginal police is a large part of the solution. The government must first ensure accessibility, then reimburse students who have paid too much in recent years, "concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
