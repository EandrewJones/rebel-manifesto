Quebec- The member for Rousseau and sentence of the official opposition in terms of finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, as well as the member for Saint-Jean and Job Spokesperson, Dave Turcotte, urge the government to act and establish a real job creation strategy. 
"Employment declines in Quebec, while it progresses in the rest of Canada. In May, it was lost 15,800 full-time jobs, while in Canada, if we exclude the decline in Quebec, it was created 46,700. Quebec has 9300 new unemployed. The last few weeks have been marked by the announcement of significant quality losses, especially at Bombardier, Davie and Alcan. What does the government intend to reverse the trend? Nicolas Marceau asked Nicolas Marceau. 
Since the power of the Liberal government, Quebec has only contributed 12.6% of full-time job creation in Canada, while we represent 23.1% of the population. "The government has no strategy, and it has rejected the reverse of the hand our proposal to hold a great economic forum. The Liberals must stop improvising and presenting us a real economic development policy including concrete measures to stimulate employment, "has reborn Dave Turcotte.
