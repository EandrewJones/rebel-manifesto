Quebec, on February 7, 2020 - On the sidelines of a large caravan rally, a Frapru initiative to demand more social housing, the member for Rimouski and spokesman for the Quebec party in housing, Harold Lebel, press The government to act to avoid a new crisis. 
IN SHORT 
"Recently, I had the chance to meet several groups working in the field of housing. They are unanimous: if nothing is done, we go to a new housing crisis of very large scale in Quebec. And again, the most vulnerable populations will be the most affected; Several seniors, social assistance providers and other single-parenting women are about to live a personal drama, perhaps even as early as July, "warned the spokesperson. 
Indeed, vacancy rates are alarming: while normal is 3%, this rate is 2.4% in Quebec City and 2.3% in Sherbrooke. In Montreal and Gatineau, it reaches 1.5% barely. "Rarity forces households to devote an increasingly important share of their housing income; For about one-third of Quebeckers who are tenants, it's more than 30%. For 14% of them, it's more than half of their salary going to rent. It has to change, and quickly, "said Harold Lebel. 
This one challenges the Minister of Housing: "Ms. Laforest, we must not live in denial. It does not go fast enough. The 731 social housing units delivered in 2018-2019 are not enough. The FRAPRU estimates that it would be necessary to build 50,000 in 5 years! It is quick to show leadership and set up a real strategy for more social housing, so that all Quebeckers are able to accommodate, according to their needs and ability to pay, "he claimed .
