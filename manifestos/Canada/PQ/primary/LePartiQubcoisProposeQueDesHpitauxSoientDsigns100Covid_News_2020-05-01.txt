Quebec, on May 1,2020 - Noting the overflows to face, particularly in Montreal, the member for the Madeleine Islands and spokesperson for the Quebecois Health, Joël Arseneau, proposes Whether facilities are dedicated to address only patients with COVID-19, questioning the propagation of the virus. 
IN SHORT 
The situation observed in some Montreal hospitals worries the deputy of the islands; According to him, it is urgent to lower pressure, especially since some institutions no longer have any room for maneuver. "Unfortunately, the end of the crisis is not yet open. To curb the spread of the virus, both in patients and staff, so we have a duty to put in place the best possible organizational practices. A way to be considered would be to dedicate buildings to COVID-19, so asolating patients with others, including the most vulnerable, "he said. 
What is a dedicated hospital? "Basically, we take buildings - arenas, congress centers - or existing hospitals and converts them into temporary installations to accommodate patients with CVIV-19 symptoms. We can also organize screening, and provide support and training for caregivers. In a dedicated hospital, it is also easier to divide the sectors, depending on the level of care required. Such amenities have been successfully used during the SARS epidemic and, more recently, in China, "detailed Joël Arseneau. 
The Parti Québécois believes that Quebec has no choice. "In front of the possibility more than likely in a second wave, we must at all costs preserve the capacity of our hospitals and, above all, the health of the staff," added the member. 
Always wishing to make a positive contribution to the debate, Joël Arseneau has also been pleased that the Government has retained its previous proposal, or to deploy buffer zones in order to avoid the spread of the virus in the elderly residences. "When good ideas are applied, it's all Quebec who wins! , "He concluded.
