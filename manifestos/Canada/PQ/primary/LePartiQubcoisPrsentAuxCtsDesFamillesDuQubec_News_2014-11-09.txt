Quebec, November 9, 2014 -The MP for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, and the member for Terrebonne and Family Spokesperson, Mathieu Traversy, are proud to be present today to Montreal, at the Grand Gathering of the Movement for the Safeguarding of Quebec Family Policy. Particularities members also join their voices to that of thousands of parents who take part in this great gathering in several municipalities of Quebec. 
"The Liberal government attacks the very foundations of Quebec family policy. This policy, however, makes the pride of the population; It serves as a model all over the world. The measures that underlie them are very important, they are progressive and advanced Quebec. Everywhere, the Liberal government has delayed the development of expected custodial service. By modulating the rates of child care depending on the income, he also decided to impose a family tax, which will particularly affect the families of the middle class. Philippe Couillard promised, in the election campaign, to limit the rise to inflation; He broke this promise, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
The member for Terrebonne recalls the positive effects of a strong family policy, socially and economically. "Through this ambitious policy, Quebec has allowed parents to reconcile family life and work. Monoparecent mothers and fathers have improved their living conditions. Tens of thousands of women have acceded more quickly to the labor market. Funding child care and support for families, it is not an expense, it is an investment, it is a measure of economic development, "concluded Mathieu Traversy.
