Quebec- On the occasion of the weekly vigil standing in front of the National Assembly, the member for Chicoutimi and Official Opposition Leader Stéphane Bédard, the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesperson for international relations, Carole Poirier, the member for Taschereau and parliamentary leader, Agnès Maltese, as well as several other members of the Quebecois Party have expressed their support for the Raif Badawi blogger. 
"Every week since the beginning of this mobilization, the Parti Québécois is present, with the citizens, to request the release of Raif Badawi and support his children and his wife, ENSAF Haidar. One year after his sentence to 10 years in prison and 1000 lashes, it's a sad birthday we emphasize today. Quebec and Canadian prime ministers must intervene urgently and concretely so that Raif Badawi is released and finds his family. It's been a year since the hard wait; it is unacceptable! Stéphane Bédard said. 
"All Quebec is mobilized for RAIF. Vigils, Letters, Marche, Support of the Barreau du Québec and lawyers without borders, resolutions of several municipal councils and the National Assembly ... All civilian means have been used to claim the release of the blogger. It is now necessary that the prime ministers Philippe Couillard and Stephen Harper, as well as the Minister of International Relations of Quebec, Christine St-Pierre, and his Federal Foreign Foreign counterpart, Rob Nicholson, are personally and deployed all the diplomatic levers possible. So that Raif Badawi can quickly find his wife and children in Sherbrooke, "added Carole Poirier.
