Montréal - The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pierre Karl Péladeau, is pleased to announce the candidacy of Gabrielle Lemieux in the partial election in the riding of Saint-Henri-Sainte-Anne. 
"These partial elections are an opportunity for Quebeckers to send a strong message to the Government of Philippe Couillard: Liberal austerity is no. Everywhere in Quebec, and here in Saint-Henri, people suffer the consequences of the ideological cups of the PLQ. Today, I mean to the citizens of Saint-Henri-Sainte-Anne that there is better. The solution to liberal austerity is the Quebecois party and Gabrielle Lemieux. Ms. Lemieux is a young administrator of the field of health, who has been working for a few years as a planning officer at CIUSS from Central-West Montreal. Its roots in Saint-Henri-Sainte-Anne are deep and includes the aspirations and challenges of the riding people, "said the leader of the Parti Québécois. 
"It's an honor for me to wear the colors of the Parti Québécois, the colors of my convictions. I love deeply Saint-Henri-Sainte-Anne. Citizens, organizations and businesses are hit hard by liberal austerity. Saint-Henri-Sainte-Anne is a riding where people help each other, where people hold public services, where they always aspire to improve their fate. To do this, we need our public schools, our popular education centers. We need our local development centers and our youth cross-employment. We need to support close caregivers and parents of young children looking for day care. We need a strong health network and in the service of the population. On November 9, the people of Saint-Henri-Sainte-Anne will vote for all this and I am confident that they will opt for a wind of change, for a more humane way, "added Gabrielle Lemieux.
