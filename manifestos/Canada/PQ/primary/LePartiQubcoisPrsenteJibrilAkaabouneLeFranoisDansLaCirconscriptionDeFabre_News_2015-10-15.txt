Laval- The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pierre Karl Péladeau, is pleased to announce the candidacy of Jibril Akaaboune the François at the partial election in the riding of Fabre. 
"These partial elections are an opportunity for Quebeckers to send a strong message to the Liberal government of Philippe Couillard: we do not accept austerity. Across Quebec and here in Fabre, people are hard hit by liberal cuts. Today, I mean to the citizens of Fabre that there is a solution to liberal austerity, it is the Parti Québécois and Jibril Akaaboune Le François. Mr. Akaaboune The François is a young person getting involved in Laval forever. He holds a bachelor's degree in Communication and Politics from the Université de Montréal and worked in the municipal political community, "said the leader of the Parti Québécois. 
"It is with great enthusiasm that I am annoying this election campaign that promises to be removed in the riding of Fabre. For some time, I have been meeting citizens, here in the field. They are shocked by the attitude of the Cuteillard government and liberal austerity. On November 9, we will have our say to protect our education, our health system and our services. By electing a member of the Parti Québécois, fabre citizens can clearly say no to the arrogance and cups of the Liberal government, "added Jibril Akaaboune Francois.
