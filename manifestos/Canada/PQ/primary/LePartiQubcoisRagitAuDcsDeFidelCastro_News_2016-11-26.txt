Quebec- The Leader of the Official Opposition, Jean-François Lisée, and Stéphane Bergeron, spokesman for the Quebecois on international relations, have kept react to the announcement of the death of the former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. 
"Fidel Castro is one of those characters who shaped the twentieth century. In their fight against the dictator Fulgencio Batista, Fidel Castro and his companions, especially Ernesto Che Guevara, was originally incarnating a hope of freedom and justice. The political scheme he has shaped in Cuba has certainly been more attentive to the needs of the population, including education and health, but the promise of liberty has given way to a new form of authoritarianism and a severe repression of Freedom of expression ", first required to remind Jean-François Lisée. 
"For several decades, Quebeckers have developed privileged relations of friendship and solidarity with Cuban and Cubans, beyond political considerations. This fraternal link between our two nations must incarnate more in cultural and commercial exchanges that can only enrich us mutually, "said Stéphane Bergeron for his part. 
"At the time of the death of this stripping figure, and while he starts a new episode of his history, we are wholeheartedly alongside the Cuban people," concluded the official opposition.
