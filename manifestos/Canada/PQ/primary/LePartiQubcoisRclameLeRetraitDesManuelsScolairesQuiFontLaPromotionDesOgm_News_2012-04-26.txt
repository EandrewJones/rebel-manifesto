Quebec- The Parti Québécois claims the withdrawal of textbooks that promote genetically modified organisms (GMOs). 
"It is totally aberrant that the Ministry of Education has authorized such manuals! Attempting to seduce our young people with GMOs under the pretext that they will revolutionize our life is absolutely laughable and lie. It is unacceptable that a manual authorized by the Ministry of Education thoroughly banals GMOs, "said the member for Jonquière and the official opposition spokeswoman in primary and secondary education, Sylvain Gaudreault. 
It was a stomach to learn yesterday that the Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports supports that this decision to approve such manuals aimed to react students to progress. "By acting in this way, the Liberal government is to deny its own policy with GMOs. Unless he has changed his idea in a stash, again, "said Jonquière's member, reminding that the commitment of the Quebec Liberal Party on GMOs in 2003 has not been overlooked nine years more late. 
For its part, the member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata and spokesperson for agriculture and food, André Simard, believes that this question of GMOs, which is the subject of strong controversy all over the world, should not be taken lightly. 
"While we should advocate agriculture and the proximity diet, it is paid in jovialism by promoting GMOs. Labeling is provided for organic foods, but is not for GMOs. It makes no sense, "supported André Simard. 
He recalled that in 2004 a parliamentary committee specifically studied the issue of GMO labeling and made recommendations. "Unfortunately, faithful to themselves, the Liberals leave the dust accumulate on this report. We believe, we have the Quebecois party, that just like the method of slaughtering animals, consumers have the right to know what they eat, "concluded the hon. Member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata, André Simard.
