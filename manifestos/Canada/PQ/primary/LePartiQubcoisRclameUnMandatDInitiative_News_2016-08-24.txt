Quebec, August 24, 2016 -The MP for Richelieu and Official Opposition for the Work, Sylvain Rochon, filed with members of the Committee on Economy and Labor (CET), a request mandate of initiative regarding the increase in the minimum wage. 
"Since its founding, the Parti Québécois has always been very concerned about the fate of modest wage workers. Of course, we support the idea of a progressive enhancement of the minimum wage, until reaching a target of $ 15 an hour, "first expressed Sylvain Rochon. 
"We therefore want to bring together experts to allow elected officials to analyze this issue in the National Assembly in depth. Although the members of Quebec Solidarity can not submit such a motion or vote in his favor, not being members of the Committee on Economy and Labor, we are pleased with their public support at that request, "continued the spokesperson. 
"Now that the application for a mandate of initiative has been tabled at the CET, we ask the members of the Liberal Party of Quebec and those of the Future Québec Coalition to support it, too," concluded the hon. Member for Richelieu.
