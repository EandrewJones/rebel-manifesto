Quebec, October 31, 2016 -The spokesperson for the Quebecois Justice, Véronique Hivon, as well as his colleagues Martine Ouellet, critic and communications spokesperson, and Stéphane Bergeron, spokesperson. Public safety, seriously worry about many cases for which confidentiality of journalistic sources has been undermined. They demand a law on the protection of journalistic sources. 
The story repeats itself. As we learned a few weeks ago that the computer of Michaël Nguyen journalist was seer, now the press revealed this morning that Patrick Lagacé's phone was under surveillance of the SPVM. 
"It is worrying that journalistic sources are not better protected. It is the work of journalists who is hurt and, as a result, the right to the information of citizens. It is high time to acquire a law to clearly reaffirm the principle of the protection of journalistic sources and to predict the criteria that must be respected to override, in a very exceptional way, to this principle, "said Véronique Hivon. 
For its part, Martine Ouellet insisted on the importance of journalistic independence in the exercise of a healthy democracy. "Journalists have the right to do their job. It's not an attack on a journalist, but a situation where investigation journalism is jeopardized, since the sources will now hesitate to transmit information, "she has indicated. 
"The Minister of Public Safety, Martin Coiteous, must quickly make sure to go to the bottom of things in this case. Such abusive practices are intolerable. We understand that the ability, for this other pillar of our democracy, which is our system of justice, to fight effectively against crime, which mines our institutions, but that must never be at the expense of individual freedoms and At the cost of infringement of the freedom and independence of the press, "said Stéphane Bergeron, for his part.
