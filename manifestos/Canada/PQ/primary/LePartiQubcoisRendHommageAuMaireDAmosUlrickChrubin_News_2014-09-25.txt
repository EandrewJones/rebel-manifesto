Québec- It is with sadness that the member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, and the member for Abitibi West, François Gendron, have learned the death of the mayor of Amos, Ulrick Cherub, occurred today at the amos hospital center. 
"On behalf of the Parliamentary Wing of the Parti Québécois, I offer my sincere condolences to the family and relatives of Mr. Cherubin. My thoughts also go to the entire community of Amos and Abitibi-Témiscamingue, which loses a worthy representative of the region. By his unparalleled kindness and his great dedication for his fellow citizens, the Mayor Cherub has marked Quebec in full, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
Ulrick Cherubi was mayor of Amos since 2002. He had been re-elected last November 3 with more than 72% of the vote. Thanks to its commitment, the city of Amos has lived in recent years a particularly dynamic period of development. In particular, the quality and diversity of the activities surrounding the celebration of the centenary of Amos, which takes place this year, have been touted by the whole population. 
The member for Abitibo West, Francois Gendron, wanted to testify to the great loss that the city of Amos saw. "The amossoise and abitibian community loses a giant. Ulrick was a swing; He had at heart the development of his city. He was a man of magnitude, of immense generosity, anxious to be near his fellow citizens. Above all, he wanted to realize and put forward his projects, for the benefit of the population, "he said.
