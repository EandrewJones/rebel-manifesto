The parliamentary leader of the Parti Québécois, Pascal Bérubé, as well as the President of the Party, Gabrielle Lemieux, reacted to the sad announcement of the death of Mr. Bernard Landry, the Prime Minister, the state man and the great patriot. On behalf of the Parti Québécois, they offer their sincere condolences to his wife, his children and grandchildren, his relatives, as well as all the independence. 
"We lost one of our greatest patriots, a man who made Quebec's independence the cause of his life. On behalf of all the members of the Partician Party, I want to express to his relatives and his family our deep sympathy, "said Gabrielle Lemieux immediately. 
"As an independent and patriot, Bernard Landry has devoted his life to give Quebeckers the means to go to the end of their ambitions. He saw, in the political situation of our nation, an aberration to be corrected, "chained Pascal Bérubé. 
"If Quebec's economy is what it is today, it is thanks to people who, like Bernard Landry, have had the audacity to make their vision a reality. Mr. Landry was one of Quebec's main economic success, his opening to the new digital economy and major reforms that will have marked our society in depth. These actions, these reforms and commitment, they are the fruit of one thing: his love for Quebec, "said the president. 
In addition to its immense credibility in the field of economy and finance, we will remember Bernard Landry as the one that allowed, among other things, the signing of the peace of the brave in 2001. "In short, all the reforms which He has realized, all the projects he has undertaken only targeted only one and great objective: to ensure that Quebeckers unite and that they have enough confidence to say yes, once and for all. We will regret it. In his memory, we will try to be at the height of this great man and to continue our course in the path he has traced, until reaching our full freedom, "concluded Pascal Bérubé.
