Quebec- The member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, wants to pay tribute to the independence activist Gilles Rhéaume, died today. 
"Great Independence Activist of Quebec, Gilles Rhéaume has worked for about 50 years in several organizations, including the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society of Montreal, which he chaired.

On behalf of the entire Quebec party team, I extend my deepest condolences to the loved ones and family of Gilles Rhéaume, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
"Few people can pretend to cumulate half a century of commitment for a cause. For this purpose, it is necessary to have a formidable determination and deep convictions, which he possessed, without the shadow of a doubt. The name of Gilles Rhéaume is forever associated with our common quest, among others because he had faith in the ability of Quebeckers to take their destiny in hand, "added the official opposition.
