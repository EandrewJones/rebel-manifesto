Quebec, November 8, 2016 - Sunday Sunday at the age of 84, the professor, sociologist and theologian Jacques Grand'maison leaves behind him a considerable legacy. The leader of the official opposition, Jean? François Lisée, wanted to pay tribute to him. 
"Jacques Grand'maison leaves in Quebec an admired intellectual heritage, after publishing about fifty books during his fruitful career. In Quebec from the sixties, he has militated that the Church is getting closer to the laity. He hoped that the transformations generated by the Second Vatican Council lead to deeper and authentic spiritual commitment. Subsequently, he launched, in collaboration with Solange Lefebvre, a major investigation of generations. Defender of greater social solidarity and a better transmission of knowledge between generations, he has not spared his efforts. In recent years, Jacques Grand'maison has published several trials on the blockages of Quebec society and the drifts of the modern world, "said Jean-François Lisée immediately. 
"Throughout his life, he has shown remarkable lucidity. It has allowed us to better understand Quebec's transformations, while new values were needed. His powerful observations have not passed unnoticed. For your in-depth and inspiring research, for your numerous punching tests, for all these stimulating interventions as amibious for Quebec, thank you, Mr. Grand'Maison, "continued the leader of the official opposition. 
"I speak, on my behalf and on behalf of the members of the Quebecois Party, my deepest condolences to the relatives of Mr. Grand'Maison," held to add Mr. Lisée. 
Over his prolific career, Jacques Grand'maison has received many distinctions. Among other things, the University of Sherbrooke awarded him a doctorate honoris causa in 1987, and he was raised to the rank of officer of the National Order of Quebec in 1996.
