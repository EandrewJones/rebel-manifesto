Quebec- The member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, wished to pay tribute to Mr. Jean Béliveau, who died on December 2nd. 
"On behalf of my members of the Parti Québécois deputies, I offer my sincere condolences to the family and relatives of Jean Béliveau. I also send them to the great family of Montreal Canadiens, an organization in which the famous number 4 has worked for more than 60 years. He was a gentleman, a man of high class, and he contributed greatly to the advancement of our national sport and our society. Real hero for generations of amateurs, he embodied a model of respect, elegance and leadership, on the rink and outside. Quebec loses today not only the greatest captain in the history of Canadians, but also a man who inspired all those who have rubbed him and admired. He will always be part of the big ones, "said Stéphane Bédard.
