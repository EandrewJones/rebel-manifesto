Quebec- The hon. Member for Saint-Jérôme and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, paid tribute to Mr. Doré, former Mayor of Montreal. 
"It's with sadness that I'm learning the death of this Greater Montrealer. On behalf of my members' colleagues from the Parti Québécois, I want to express my sincere condolences to his family, his relatives as well as to people who have rubbed him during his long and brilliant career. Jean Doré had an immense love and ambition for his city. Always he placed citizens at the center of his political commitment. He marked the metropolis by his clear vision of citizen participation, the environment, the safeguarding of heritage and urban planning, among others. I want to greet his dedication to the population of Montreal and Quebec, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
The leader of the official opposition also wanted to emphasize the important achievements that Mr. Doré bequeathed to Montreal. "It is not only at the origin of a greater democratization of the municipal administration, but also the leading planning plan for the history of Montreal. We also owe him the redevelopment of several sectors of the city, including the city center, Old Montreal, the Lachine Canal, among others. Among his great legacies, we can not ignore the Museum of Archeology and History of Pointe-à-Callière, the Biodôme, the development of the garden of the Town Hall. Jean Doré had a huge leap forward in Montreal, "he added. 
Pierre Karl Péladeau also greeted Jean Golden's deep commitment for several social causes, including the heart hostels. "He served as President and Spokesperson for Heart Inns for more than 10 years. He dedicated these years to young people in difficulty and homeless. Just as he said, Quebec must bet on his youth, on all his young, because they constitute his capital of hope, "he concluded.
