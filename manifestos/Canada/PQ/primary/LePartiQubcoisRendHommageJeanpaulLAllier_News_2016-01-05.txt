Quebec- The Leader of the Official Opposition, Head of the Capitale-Nationale Region, Pierre Karl Péladeau, and the member for Taschereau, Agnès Maltese, wanted to pay tribute to Jean-Paul Allier, who died that night. 
"Jean-Paul Allier contributed to the advancement of Quebec and our national capital. As Minister of the Bourassa Government, he was a defender of culture, including evolving our cultural policy. I also remember the role he played in 1995, among others in the referendum campaign and as Chairman of the Capital Commission on the Future of Quebec. We let us lose a great mayor today, a man who loved his city and his fellow citizens. We will remember a hired mayor and a man of conviction. On behalf of the whole party of the Parti Québécois, I extend my deepest condolences to the family and relatives of Mr. L'Allier, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"As mayor, he brought a modern vision to the Capital Quebec, highlighting the concept of beauty economy. He knew, thus, rally the lively forces of our city by reconciling urban planning, culture, tourism and democracy, in concert with international relations. It is also he who has allowed the grouping of the big city of Quebec. With respect to the development and embellishment of the city, its great achievements remain unquestionably the revitalization of the Saint-Charles River and Saint-Roch district. Great humanist, he has committed to many causes and in several organizations, especially thanks to the very curub of the Mayor of Quebec. Thank you, Mr. Allier, "added Agnès Maltese.
