Quebec- The member for Jonquière and Leader of the Official Opposition, Sylvain Gaudreault, learned with sadness the death of the member for Arthabaska, Sylvie Roy. 
"On behalf of the whole party of the Parti Québécois, I extend my deepest condolences to the family, relatives and staff of Sylvie Roy.

She defended her convictions with vigor and passion, first with the ADQ, then to the CAQ, and as an independent member, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
"Sylvie Roy has been a member who placed justice and public service at the center of his priorities. In particular, it was the first to claim a commission of inquiry into corruption and collusion. All of the members of the National Assembly feel a deep sadness today, while we lose a respected colleague of all, "added the official opposition.
