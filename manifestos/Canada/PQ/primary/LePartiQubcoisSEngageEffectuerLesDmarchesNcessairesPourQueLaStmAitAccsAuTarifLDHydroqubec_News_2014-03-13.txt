Montréal - the candidate of the Parti Québécois in Vachon and Minister of Natural Resources, Martine Ouellet, the candidate in Rosemont and Minister of International Relations, Francophonie and Foreign Trade and Minister responsible for the Montreal Region, Jean-François Lisée, the candidate in Sainte-Marie-Saint-Jacques, Daniel Breton, and the candidate in Saint-Henri-Sainte-Anne, Véronique Fournier, undertake to carry out the necessary steps so that the transport company of Montreal (STM) has access to the Tariff L of Hydro-Québec. This commitment is part of the Lastrategy of Electrification of the Government of the Parti Québécois. 
Martine Ouellet has already started approaches to Hydro-Québec to recognize that the STM is conducting an industrial activity, which would make it eligible for L. 
"We will continue the work: a government government will continue its efforts with Hydro-Québec to ensure that the Transportation Corporation of Montreal has access to Tariff L. This measure would represent for the STM an annual economy of approximately $ 400,000 per Report to the LG tariff, "said Martine Ouellet. 
The total electricity bill of the STM in 2013 was approximately $ 25 million. 
It should be remembered that in 2010, the Liberal government divided the price rate L and LG. The T rate applies to industrial customers of 5 MW and more and the LG tariff, other 5 MW and more customers. 
"This is a measure that is important to us since the STM provides an essential service to the citizens of Montreal. In addition, this is part of the continuity of our commitments for transport electrification, "concluded Jean-François Lisée. 
We have a plan and the team to succeed. Today, it's time to give us the means to go further.
