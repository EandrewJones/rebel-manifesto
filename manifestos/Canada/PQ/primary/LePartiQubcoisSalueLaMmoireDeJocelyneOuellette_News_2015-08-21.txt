His role in our grand party was decisive; In addition to participating in his foundation, she worked very hard to make the program known to women and men in the Ottawa region. Having conquered the hearts of the citizens of Hull, she dignified them represented at the National Assembly from 1976 to 1981. We will remember her as a committed and voluntary woman, activist above all, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau . 
Stéphane Bergeron has stimulated that Jocelyne Ouellette was one of the first four women to have been elected under the banner of the Parti Québécois. "She was a pioneer, not only for our project to make Quebec a country, but also in terms of ethics and integrity; In 1978, it was she who established as a Minister of Public Works and Procurement, a system of allocation of government contracts based on fairness and transparency, called "Rosalie". It took courage and determination, but Ms. Ouellette was not the kind to give up without fighting, nor to reflect the work to someone else. Quebeckers and Quebeckers, particularly those of the Outaouais, can be lucky enough to have it to ensure their interests, "he added.
