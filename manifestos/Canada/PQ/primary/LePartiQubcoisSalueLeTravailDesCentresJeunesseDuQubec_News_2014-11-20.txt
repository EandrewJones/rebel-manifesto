Quebec- The member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, youth protection, home care and prevention, Jean-François Lisée, highlights Youth Center Week 2014, who unfolded from 16 to 22 November. 
"This is an opportunity to recognize the work of more than 14,000 women and men who have been united around the same goal for more than 20 years: that of accompanying and helping youth in difficulty and their families. I want to salute their remarkable commitment and express their gratitude for all the energy they spend on these thousands of young people who, every year, frequent the youth centers, in search of human and professional support. Thanks to this supervision, they have the opportunity to flourish and realize their dreams, "said Jean-François Lisée. 
The member also expressed the concern of many researchers, experts, managers and professionals in the youth protection community as to the impact of Bill 10. "The reform of Minister Gaétan Barrette proposes to merge the youth centers with all Other health facilities for creating new megastructures. Thus, one is prepared to destruct the model of protection of the youth of Quebec, yet effective and envied beyond our borders. Youth centers hold essential expertise and offer a range of services to among the most vulnerable young people in our society. It is therefore essential that this Quebec success be preserved and valued ", concluded Jean-François Lisée.
