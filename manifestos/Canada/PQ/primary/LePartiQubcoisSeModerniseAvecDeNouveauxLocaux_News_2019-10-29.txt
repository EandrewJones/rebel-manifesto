Montreal, October 18, 2019 - In the context of the recovery approach started last March, the National Executive of the Parti Québécois made the choice to move the permanence into new premises. This new location will better meet the needs of the party and will offer more agility to its functioning and its organization. 
"The Parti Québécois will soon adopt new statutes to modernize its functioning and a declaration of principles to redefine its values and mission. Our move in a whole new permanence is part of this approach and help give our political training all the tools to deal with the new political reality and advance our Quebec Independence Project. He said the Director General of the Parti Québécois, Carole Poirier. 
From November 1st, the new Parti Québécois permanence will be at the following address:
