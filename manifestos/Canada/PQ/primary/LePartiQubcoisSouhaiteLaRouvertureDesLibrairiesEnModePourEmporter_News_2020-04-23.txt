Quebec, on April 23, 2020 - In the wake of his request for Québec to promote a plan of recovery and promotion for the cultural industry, the member for Gaspé and spokesman for the Parti Culture, Méganne Perry Melançon, there is a promising proposal: that the libraries can reopen by adopting a "order order" formula. 
IN SHORT 
"Like all signals indicate that reading will be a popular activity this summer, it would be very important for bookstores to offer an order service to take away, as do the restaurants or pharmacies. The formula we propose includes many advantages: not only readers will have directly access to the products they cover, but the booksellers will also benefit, in particular by avoiding the delivery costs. For a small independent business, this can change the situation, "Advanced Megan Perry Melançon. 
In his view, such a service does not represent an increased risk of contamination - neither for customers nor for traders. "We have examples that come from Europe: in Berlin, during confinement, bookstores have remained operational because it is essential. In France, we undertake these days a partial reopening, using this formula "to carry". If one ensures the respect of the sanitary and distancing rules, it is not to be feared the spread of the virus. Other shops do it; It's fast, it works well, and it can be deployed right now, "said the member for Gaspé. 
"The middle of the arts and culture needs that a clear signal, and the libraries are an essential link in the chain. Giving them oxygen is to show all the importance of the authors and, more broadly, artists in our lives, "concluded Megan Perry Melançon. 
Quebec has some 200 licensed libraries, spread over the entire territory. With the addition of 4000 to 5000 new titles a year, the industry has enough to comply with each Quebecker.
