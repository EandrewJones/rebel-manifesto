Quebec- Following the unanimous adoption on February 26, a motion to make February 11 of each year a tribute to Nelson Mandela, the member for Bourget and spokesman for the official opposition Immigration, Maka Kotto, today tabled Bill 493, law proclaiming Nelson Mandela day. 
"Nelson Mandela is a model, a reference for those who understand that freedom, justice, human rights, equality and fraternity between peoples constitute fundamental universal values. To dedicate him a day would recognize his exceptional contribution to the defense and promotion of these, "said the member for Bourget. 
Maka Kotto also recalled that at the time, Quebec, through its politicians, had clearly supported Nelson Mandela in her quest for freedom and fairness. "René Lévesque has banned the sale of South African wines to the SAQ. Brian Mulroney played a major role internationally by supporting the boycott of South Africa, as long as apartheid ravierated. Jean Doré refused to grant any contract to a company with interests in South Africa. Finally, Robert Bourassa has changed Laloi on cities and citiesAfin to allow Jean Doré to act. Beyond the partisan lines, our leaders concretely supported this great man that Nelson Mandela was. We therefore wish that our bill is quickly adopted, in order to pursue this noble tradition, "he concluded.
