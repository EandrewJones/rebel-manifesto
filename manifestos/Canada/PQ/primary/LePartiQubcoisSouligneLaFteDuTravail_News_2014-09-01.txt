Qu√©bec- The member for Sanguinet and official opposition spokesperson for the work and pension plans, Alain Therrien, says the Labor Day. 
"Today, I join my voice to workers throughout Quebec to highlight the importance of offering good working conditions and a safe environment for all. Workers participate in greater prosperity for the entire society. In this day of work, also have a thought for retirees; Let us provide them with the best possible living conditions after their career. 
In order to reach a more prosperous society, the Liberal government must quickly submit a plan and vision for support for job creation and economic development. And it is certainly not clutching in a logic of austerity that it will promote job creation in cities and regions of Quebec, "said Alain Therrien.
