Member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, and the member for Sanguinet and Spokesperson on Work, Alain Therrien, join their voices to that of all Quebeckers to highlight the International Day of Women Workers and workers, which will take place tomorrow, as well as the essential contribution of these to the development of Quebec society. 
"Every year, May 1st is an opportunity to remind us that the future of Quebec involves increased support to workers, so that everyone can contribute to the economic, social and cultural development of Quebec. On this international day of workers, we will also reiterate the need for good conditions and a safe workplace.

We will also benefit from reaffirming our clear opposition to liberal austerity, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
Liberal austerity, a brake on Quebec's development 
Alain Therrien mentions that tomorrow, the members of the Quebecois Party will participate in various citizen events, in several regions of Quebec. "Families, regions and workers are the costs of cuts imposed by the Liberal government. Our public health and education networks are hard hit, as are the services given to the most vulnerable in our society. It is not going down everywhere that we will ensure the future of our nation, but by having a vigorous economic and social development policy, lined with a long-term vision. The Liberal government must hear all citizens who will demonstrate, "he concluded.
