Quebec, October 17, 2014 -The hon. Member for Rimouski and official opposition spokesperson for poverty, solidarity and social economy, Harold Lebel, highlights the International Day for the Elimination of Poverty . He invites the public and the government to reflect on the measures to be put in place to help poor and vulnerable people. 
"The fight against poverty is a matter of social justice and solidarity that concerns the whole population. On the one hand, everyone is likely to meet, one day, in a situation of poverty. A health problem, age, isolation or marginalization can lead us suddenly into a very difficult economic position. On the other hand, a healthy society is an inclusive and equal society. We know today that there is a close link between poverty reduction and the reduction of violence and health problems, "said Harold Lebel. 
The member also reiterated that the Liberal government must make every effort to support the most vulnerable of our society, including by ceasing the cuts that touch them directly. "Liberal austerity hurts the poorest and organizations that help them on a daily basis. The government needs to review the law to combat poverty and social exclusion. The balance sheet of the last 10 years must be done, and new objectives must be defined, far from liberal austerity, "he concluded. 
Remember that the International Day for the Elimination of Poverty has been celebrated every year since 1993, when the General Assembly of the International Organization of the United Nations has designated this day to promote awareness of the need to eradicate poverty And misery in all countries, one of eight Millennium Development Goals.
