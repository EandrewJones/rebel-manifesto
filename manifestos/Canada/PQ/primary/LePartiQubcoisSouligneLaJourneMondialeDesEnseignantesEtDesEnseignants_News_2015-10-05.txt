Québec- On behalf of the entire deputation of its political formation, the member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesman for the Parti Party in terms of education and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, highlights World Teachers' Day and teachers, as decreed in 1994 by the United Nations Organization of Education, Scientific and Culture, UNESCO. 
"We believe that it is particularly important to recall the titanic work done every day by Quebec teachers, especially since the government does not even hide to despise them. The Minister of Education went so far as to say that it would be "clumsy" to reinvest in education, to reinvest in supporting students in difficulty. And, after that, he wonders why teachers mobilize, "said Alexandre Cloutier. 
Remember that the Liberal Party has had a lot in schools, particularly in the positions of professionals who work with youth in difficulty learning or adaptation integrated into the regular classes. "This situation weighs the task of teachers, who have less time to give each child. It hurts the quality of teaching. And to say that the government wants to add a layer by raising master-student ratios and no longer holding students in difficulty in the constitution of groups. It's totally unacceptable, "said the member of the Parti Québécois. 
"The negotiations between teachers and the government can not be dissociated from the quality of education in Quebec. That's why we will continue to make the voice of teachers heard in the coming weeks and the next few months, "concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
