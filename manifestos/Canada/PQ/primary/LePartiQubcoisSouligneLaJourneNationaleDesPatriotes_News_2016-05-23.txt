Quebec- The member for Jonqui√®re and Leader of the Official Opposition, Sylvain Gaudreault, stressed the National Day of Patriots and their struggle for the recognition of their nation, for his political freedom and the establishment of a government democratic. 
"In front of the crushing law of the strongest and the weight of an apparent fatality, the patriots had only their bravery, their resilience, the love of freedom and their faith in a better future. These are true heroes, and we must perpetuate the values for which they fought. Patriotic men and women, 180 years ago, got up to defend principles of equality, justice and democracy, "said the leader of the official opposition. 
"The actions of the patriots must remain in our collective memory, since the values they have courageously defended are more lively and more relevant than ever. However, currently the Liberal government postpones the application of the History Program in high school; We will continue to express our disagreement, "he added. 
"History inspires us, teaches us to make choices and it helps to train citizens and enlightened citizens. It reminds us that a nation is built day after day, as the choices it makes, the decisions it takes, the causes it defends. The patriots of 1837-1838, among others, illustrate this reality well; Their memory, like that of other characters who have marked our history, must absolutely be cultivated so that the people of Quebec continues to progress, with pride, determination and audacity, "concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
