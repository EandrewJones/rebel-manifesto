Quebec- The member for Terrebonne and the official opposition on the family, Mathieu Traversy, is pleased to highlight the 2015 Quebec Care Week, standing from 24 to 30 May and with root themes and my wings. 
"On behalf of my colleagues in the parliamentary wing of the Parti Québécois, I raise my hat to all the educators who are dedicated which, every day, are committed to providing quality services to children and their parents. Their commitment and generosity are sincere and their efforts, necessary for the proper functioning of the network, especially in this context of fiscal austerity. These people truly hold the service for the strength of their arms; We are very grateful to them! , "Said the spokesman. 
It is at the initiative of a government of the Parti Québécois that the network of childhood education services was born in 1997. Since then, the model is envied by the world, particularly because it Given thousands of new parents the choice to return to school or in the labor market, as well as the ability to better harmonize work and family life. Unfortunately, this Quebec success is currently becoming mistaken by the Liberal government of Philippe Couillard. 
"Increase and modulation of rates, end of universality, privatization rising ... The short-view decisions of the government threaten equal opportunities. It is all the more worrying that it lacks so much space in service - since the Liberals have delayed the development - that a real resale market of license, entitling to subsidized places, has developed . Some people get richer, there is speculation that is done on the back of children; It's totally inadmissible! Fortunately, we will have the opportunity to deepen this issue at the parliamentary committee that we proposed and to which the minister finally consented. The quality of the services given to children and their safety must be priorities at all times, "concluded the member.
