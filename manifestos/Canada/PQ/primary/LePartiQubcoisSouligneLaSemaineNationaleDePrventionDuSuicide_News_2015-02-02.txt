Quebec- The member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, youth protection, home care and prevention, Jean-François Lisée, points out the 25th National Suicide Prevention Week. 
"In 2012, 1102 people removed life in Quebec; It's 3 people a day, 3 people too much. Efforts to combat this sad and harmful phenomenon need to be intensified and awareness, continued. Because despite the gains made in recent years in the prevention of suicide, constant vigilance remains necessary. All means must be put in place so that each Quebecker knows where to find help; No one should consider suicide as an option, "said Jean-François Lisée. 
The member emphasizes, however, that in this respect, the effects of liberal austerity are worrying. "Suicide prevention stakeholders, like us, fear the compressions imposed by the government. Hope that it quickly reveals its policy of prevention of suicide; We look forward to it, "he concluded. 
Jean-François Lisé has also insisted on the importance of getting help; At any time, people with suicidal thoughts or a relative in distress can contact a speaker specializing in 1,866 calls (277-3553).
