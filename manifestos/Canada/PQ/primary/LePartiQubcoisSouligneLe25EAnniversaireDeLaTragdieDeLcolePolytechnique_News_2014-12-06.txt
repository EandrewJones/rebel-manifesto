Quebec- The member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, and the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, now emphasize the 25th anniversary of the drama that occurred at the 'Polytechnic School of Montreal. 
"On 6 December 1989, Quebec lived one day of darkest. He remains an unfortunate memory that remains engraved in our memories. While they studied and that they did nothing but continue their dream, 14 young women were mowed. Our thoughts today go to these women, as well as their loved ones. The commemoration of this tragedy encourages us to reflect collectively on violence in our society, particularly with that made to women and girls. We have to do everything, make everything implemented, so that such a tragedy never happens, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
"The Polytechnic event has reached our identity directly and values. Our company believes in equality. In this sense, fighting all forms of violence is a collective duty, as much as an individual responsibility. Occupied 25 years ago, this drama was at the base of a shared awareness. Despite the great advances of women in society and in the labor market, there is still the way to do. The march for equality between women and men must continue, "said Carole Poirier.
