Quebec- The member for Saint-Jérôme and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, as well as the member for Rousseau and spokesperson in finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, emphasized the 50th anniversary of the Caisse de Deposit and placement of Quebec. 
"On July 15, 1965, the Government of Jean Lesage adopted the law 51 creating the Caisse de Dépôt and placement of Quebec. Range by visionaries and builders, this institution has become a powerful tool for emancipation and economic development for Quebeckers. This allowed us, at the time, to get us out of the influence of St-James Street Financial Center. I can not ignore the immense contribution of Prime Minister Jacques Parizeau in the creation of the Fund and Investment Fund. Then economic adviser to Prime Minister Jean Lesage, he contributed to the establishment of an institution that existed anywhere else, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"The Quiet Revolution has been a great period of social and economic liberation for Quebeckers, and the Caisse has been an essential instrument for doing so. The place it occupies is important for the development of our companies and the fruiting of citizens' bottom of wool. She supported companies from here, which allowed them to grow and, for some, to become florets of Quebec, "added Nicolas Marceau.
