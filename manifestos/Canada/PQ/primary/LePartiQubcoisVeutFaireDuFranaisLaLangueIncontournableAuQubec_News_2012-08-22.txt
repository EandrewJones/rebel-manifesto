Montreal- The Parti Québécois wants to make French the essential language in Quebec. In this regard, he proposes to submit a new law 101 and to establish a Quebec citizenship if it is brought to power on September 4th. 
The Quebec citizenship bill proposed by the Parti Québécois will resume the provisions concerning Quebec citizenship contained in Bill 195, tabled in the National Assembly by the leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, in 2007. 
Thus, Quebec citizenship would be automatically granted to all citizens living on the territory of Quebec at the time of adoption of the law. Subsequently, newcomers could obtain their Quebec citizenship by demonstrating an appropriate knowledge of Quebec and the French language. Such requirements would be similar to those required by the Government of Canada, which requires appropriate knowledge of Canada and one of the two official languages to obtain Canadian citizenship. Other countries around the world also have these requirements, such as Australia, Germany, the United States, France and Japan. Obtaining Quebec citizenship will allow anyone to apply for an election to a position in a Quebec institution. 
The bill will be the subject of a parliamentary committee of the National Assembly where all citizens will be invited to express their point of view.
