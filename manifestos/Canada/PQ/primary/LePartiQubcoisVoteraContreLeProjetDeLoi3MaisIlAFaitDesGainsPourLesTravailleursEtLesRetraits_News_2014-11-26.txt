Quebec- The member for Sanguinet and official opposition on the work and pension plans, Alain Therrien, presents the gains obtained during the detailed study of Bill 3, covering the plans of retirement of municipal employees. He also announces that his political training will vote against the bill. 
"We used the time of the detailed study to try to convince the Minister of the merits of our positions, particularly with regard to past deficits and the importance of leaving more space to negotiation, as claimed. Also cities. Since the beginning, our only goal has been to get real gains for retirees and active participating workers, without compromising the sustainability of pension plans or the ability to pay taxpayers, "said Alain Therrien. 
Here are the three gains that the opposition made and who agreed in the agreement: 
The Parti Québécois has chosen to be constructive 
"The government, with or without our support, would adopt the bill. We have therefore chosen to be constructive and to make us the holders of the applications and criticism heard during the consultations. We will still vote against the bill, particularly because of the previous ones that it creates on the breach of contracts, with past deficits and the lack of respect for negotiation, "added the spokesman. 
The member recalled that the parliamentary committee sat for 77 hours, without counting the time spent to hear the groups concerned. The government is the majority, even more with the collaboration and the tacit - and navigating support - of the CAQ. Quebec solidarity, for its part, shone by its absence. 
"We believe that our responsibility was to improve the bill, to the extent of the power available to the official opposition. These three amendments have been torn off, and despite the complete closure of the government. They represent real gains for workers and retirees. In front of the gag threat, we must absolutely secure them, "concluded Alain Therrien.
