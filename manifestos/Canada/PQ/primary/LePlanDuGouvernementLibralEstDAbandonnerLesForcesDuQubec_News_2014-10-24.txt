"Yesterday, the National Bank has lowered its GDP growth forecast by 1.9% to 1.6%. Clearly, the Government of Philippe Couillard has no economic policy and is unable to increase income. So, by ideology, it benefits from the situation to make disappear what sets us apart from Canada, while even federalists convinced like Robert Bourassa held that particular identity. He wants, neither more nor less, to land what makes the originality and specificity of Quebec, "said Alain Therrien. 
"The government focused on the liberal effect for economic growth. In power for six months, he realizes that magic thinking does not work. In addition, under the mask of austerity, the government centralizes and decreases services, which hurts families, workers, regions and the poor. Moreover, the Standing Committee on Programs is not even authorized to speak publicly. However, the government must answer its cuts and political choices, "concluded the hon. Member for Sanguinet.
