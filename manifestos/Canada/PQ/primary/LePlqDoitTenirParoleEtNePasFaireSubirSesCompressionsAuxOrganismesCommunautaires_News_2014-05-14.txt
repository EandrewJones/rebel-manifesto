Quebec- The official opposition spokesperson for the social services of Rosemont, Jean-François Lisée, urges the Minister delegated to Rehabilitation, the Protection of Youth and Public Health, Lucie Charlebois, and The Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, to respect the unanimous commitment of the National Assembly to enhance the financing of community organizations working in health and social services. 
"The groups are worried, and we too, of the silence of the Liberals on this subject during the campaign, and that of the Couillard government since his election," said Jean? François Lisée. The 3,000 community health and social services organizations contribute to the quality of life of hundreds of thousands of Quebeckers with mental health, homelessness or dependency issues. Organizations also support people in difficulty, people with disabilities and their families, seniors and poor people. » 
Noting that the structural underfunding of these groups threatened their ability to assume their mandate, the National Assembly unanimously adopted a motion requiring the enhancement of the financing of self-employed Community action agencies and social services. 
In its plan of ActionLa Solidarity: a wealth for Quebec, the Parti Québécois government announced, in the fall of 2013, an annual reinvestment of $ 40 million, whose first payment was to be done next September. 
"It is now time for the Couillard government to confirm in the community that money aimed at supporting their global mission will be included in the next budget. It is absolutely unacceptable that the most vulnerable Quebecers pay for the austerity advocated by the Couillard Government, "concluded the member for Rosemont.
