Quebec- The Leader of the Official Opposition, Member of Parliament for Jonquière and spokesman for the Quebec's Sustainable Development, Sylvain Gaudreault, the member for Terrebonne and Spokesperson in the field of environment and the fight against climate change, Mathieu Traversy, as well as the member for Sanguinet and spokesperson in terms of energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, denounce the position of the federalist parties as to the energy project is. 
"By refusing to support a motion from the Quebec party demanding Quebec government that it is pronounced against the Energy East Project, the Liberal Party and the Future Québec Coalition provide additional evidence that their elected officials are not in phase with the population they represent. It is very clear: Quebeckers can not rely on federalist parties to defend their interests, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
"Unlike the elected representatives of the Liberal Party and the CAQ, the Parti Québécois continues to claim that the last word on the energy project is returning to Quebecers, and on their own. Citizens and citizens are asking for concrete solutions to carry out Quebec's energy transition. They want the electrification of transport, real advances in collective transport and the sustainable development of the territory; Not a more oil transport project in their yard! , "Added Mathieu Traversy. 
"It is to Quebeckers and Quebeckers to decide whether the pipeline project can see the day or not. The government must put its panties and listen to the population. And remember that it does not see sufficient economic benefits; The social acceptability of such a project is not at the rendezvous, "concluded Alain Therrien.
