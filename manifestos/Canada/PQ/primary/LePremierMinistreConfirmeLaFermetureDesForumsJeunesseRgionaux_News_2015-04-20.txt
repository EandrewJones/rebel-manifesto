Quebec- The member for Saint-Jean and the official opposition spokesperson for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, denounces the Prime Minister's decision, who confirmed this morning that His government will put the ax in the youth forums of Quebec. In response to his question, Philippe Couillard refused to guarantee that the youth forums will survive. 
"The head of the youth files, Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, does not go to the defense of young people. Where was it when we vigorously denounced the change of mission of youth crossing jobs? Where is it in the youth forums file? The only time in several weeks he speaks about young people, it is to announce the closure of youth forums. In addition, he does that in full questions, during a gag. It would be expected from a prime minister to more respect for employees and administrators. Why did he wait three weeks before informing them of his decision? Asked Dave Turcotte. 
"By allowing young people to participate concretely with the reflections and decisions that affect them, youth forums are a unique model that we want in the world. Through the Regional Youth Investment Fund, they also provide assistance to thousands of projects for young people. Unfortunately, by imposing the gagging bill 28, several important consultation tools are sacrificed in all regions of Quebec, including youth forums, "he added. 
"In addition to not paid the amounts planned for last year, the Liberal government has neglected to renew the mandates of the forums, as well as their budgets for this year. Result: Several of them had to walk away from their staff, or even put the key into the door. These organizations are essential for youth and regions of Quebec; Put the ax, it's just unacceptable. I will continue the fight with them, "concluded Dave Turcotte.
