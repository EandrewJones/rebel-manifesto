Quebec- The member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, asked Prime Minister Philippe Couillard to say whether he still trusts his minister of the economy, innovation and exports, Jacques Daoust . 
"Rumors and the media report a departure from the minister in June. Does this mean that Quebec will not have a minister of the economy by then? The Prime Minister must reiterate his confidence in Jacques Daoust or dismiss him from office immediately. For if the minister no longer has the confidence of Philippe Couillard, how can he fulfill his mandates? Asked Stéphane Bédard. 
"The many job losses - at Bombardier, Alcan, resolved, including - are worrying. Quality jobs disappear. We need a real policy of economic development and a person to put it in place. Already the Liberal government practices chronic to economy, it would not be necessary, moreover, to find itself with a minister who no longer have the confidence of his boss, "added the head of the official opposition.
