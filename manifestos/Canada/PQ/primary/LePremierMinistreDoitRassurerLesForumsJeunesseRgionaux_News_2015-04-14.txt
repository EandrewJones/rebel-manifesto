Quebec- The member for Saint John and official opposition spokesperson for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, asks Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, head of the youth files, Raise the uncertainty surrounding the survival of regional youth forums. 
"Presidencies are concerned about the lack of government transparency; They do not know even if youth forums will continue to exist! Rumors persist, and no one to the government meets the grouping of regional youth forums; What is this way of acting? The first thing to do is, at the very least, to contact the youth forums and to respond to their concerns, "said Dave Turcotte. 
"Unfortunately, youth pays the price of liberal austerity and will also pay that of upcoming cuts. The 19 youth forums are important organizations, including the improvement of the citizen participation of young people and the relay of their priorities with elected municipal and Quebec. The government must lift the uncertainty that places about their future, "the hon. Member has.
