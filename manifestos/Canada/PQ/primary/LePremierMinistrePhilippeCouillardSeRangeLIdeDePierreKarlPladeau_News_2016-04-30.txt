Quebec - On the eve of the International Day of Workers, while Prime Minister Philippe Couillard seems to engage in the holding of an economic summit to revive employment in Quebec, the head of the Official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, who had proposed this idea from May 18, 2015, tends his hand again to the government. 
"As soon as he arrived as leader of the Parti Québécois, noting the gloom and the absence of a credible and consensual economic plan, I proposed the Prime Minister the holding of this summit. I suggested then to invite socio-economic actors to a major appointment where we might all help to define the means and priorities of a real plan of sustainable growth. Several actors had supported the idea, however, rejected the reverse of the hand by Philippe Couillard. Today, we are happy that it finally seems to consent, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
Since the Québécois party made this economic summit proposal to the Prime Minister, the situation has deteriorated further, making this meeting of socio-economic actors more urgent than ever: 1% limited growth, business investments at zero, No jobs created in the last 12 months. 
Remember that the leader of the Quebecois party has made a tour of the major actors of the Quebec economy and social economy, in order to present proposals to stimulate growth and ensure the prosperity of our regions. Some of them will be unveiled soon. 
The Prime Minister must confirm it  "We ask Philippe Couillard to quickly confirm the holding of this meeting and tell us when it will take place. It must be done as soon as possible. We offer, as we have done for a year, our collaboration. Liberal austerity hurts economic development, while it has not been a job for one year. We must do better, "concluded the leader of the Parti Québécois.
