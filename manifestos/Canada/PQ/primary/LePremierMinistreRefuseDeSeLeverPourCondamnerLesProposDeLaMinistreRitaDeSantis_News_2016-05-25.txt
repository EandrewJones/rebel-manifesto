Quebec- The member for Marie-Victorin and the Parliamentary Leader of the Official Opposition, Bernard Drainville, regrets that the Prime Minister refused to stand up to answer the questions concerning the unacceptable remarks that the minister responsible for access to The information and reform of democratic institutions, Rita de Santis. 
"The Prime Minister, who does not cease to drape in morality, who never fails an opportunity to accuse other drifting parties or taxing intolerance, does he consider the words of his minister worthy of a minister of the Government of Quebec? Imagine if these words had been pronounced by a member or a member of the Quebecois party or even CAQ; It would have been entitled to a big outcry, with great and high cries, for requests for resignation. The Prime Minister would have eager to talk about appeals to violence and hate speech on all forums. What was asked today was to get up and to recognize that his minister went too far. We wanted it to admit, at the very least, a little discomfort. He did not even do it, it's deplorable, "said Bernard Drainville. 
"Every week brings a lot of controversial comments from the Minister of Santis. After qualifying peanuts the $ 150,000 funding target imposed on liberal ministers, after having bonded the idea of liberal activists to flush donations at $ 100, now stumbled again, during a public event, in the presence of the Mayor of Montreal. I quote it, speaking of his teacher: "Anyone who would talk to a child as she told me should be killed, slaughtered, pier I do not know where." End of quote. The minister apologized was the only thing to do, but why did not the Prime Minister speak today to recognize that she had slipped? ", Concluded the parliamentary leader of the official opposition.
