Quebec, September 7, 2016 -The member of Saint-Jean and spokesman for the Parti Québécois in terms of employment, social solidarity, fight against poverty and for the youth, Dave Turcotte, regrets that the only time since several Months where Prime Minister Philippe Couillard demonstrates a real firmness, it is to sanction young people benefiting from social assistance, brandishing a married threat of parliamentary gag. 
"We would have liked to see, on the part of the Prime Minister, the same determination and the same fierceness to oppose the sale of RONA, to clean up the MTQ and to limit the harassous increases of the salary of doctors. He could also, also be uncomfortable by refusing any cup touching students in our schools. No, the Prime Minister is determined only when it comes to sanctioning youth benefiting social assistance, "said Dave Turcotte. 
"The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, François Blais, remains unable to demonstrate how the application of sanctions against the most vulnerable to our company promotes their insertion or reintegration into the labor market. I remind the minister that in parliamentary committee, we received several groups; None of them supported the penalties planned by Bill 70. Why? It's simple: In Quebec, we can not live with only $ 400 a month, "concluded the member for Saint John.
