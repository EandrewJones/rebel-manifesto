Quebec, on December 17, 2014 - Following the announcement of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Production Factory Project of the IFFCO Company in Bécancour, the member for Saint-Jérôme and spokesman for the Official opposition in the field of economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, asks the Liberal government to get out of his torpor and act for employment in Quebec and Bécanour. 
"The IFFCO project is expected by the people of the region. It would create 1500 jobs during its construction and 250 in the long term. The Minister of Economy, Jacques Daoust, and the Minister Delegate to Regional Economic Development, Jean-Denis Girard, must immediately get to work with the company so that this project is realized. The region has already suffered enough from the liberal effect, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
No Economic Policy for Employment 
"We still have proof that the liberal effect does not work, that it is a view of the mind. Only Prime Minister Couillard and his ministers continue to make their economic policy. As a Christmas approach, it's time to make a concrete gift to Quebecers: to promote job creation by a real economic policy, "supported the member. 
Since their arrival, the Liberals have increased taxes, taxes and rates of nearly $ 800 million, not counting the rise in electricity rates, school taxes and municipal taxes. "The Liberal government does not return to Vergundy and without stopping in the pockets of Quebeckers since arriving in power. It is now time for him to work as hard to create jobs, "concluded the hon. Member for Saint-Jérôme.
