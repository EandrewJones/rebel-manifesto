"It is with sadness that I learned the death of Abbé Raymond Gravel. Many of us discovered it during its move to the House of Commons as a member of the Bloc Québécois. We saw at work a straight man with sincere and unshakeable commitment. 
These qualities, revealed to all Quebeckers, however, were known for years by many Lanaudois and Lanaudoises; Throughout his priestly life, he had served them with the same ardor, the same smile, the same enthusiasm. 
In recent months, although suffering, Father Gravel has held sporadically reappearing in the news, as if to tell us that even diminished by the disease, we must never give in to fatality. An exercise of humility that moved more than one. 
Today, in my name and on behalf of the members of the Parti Québécois, I wish to salute the worthy example that Father Gravel has given us, and this throughout his public life. »
