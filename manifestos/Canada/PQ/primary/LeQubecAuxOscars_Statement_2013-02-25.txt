Tonight, two productions will give us the honor of representing Quebec at the Oscars ceremony: Rebel of director Kim Nguyen, and Henry of Yan England. 
For a long time, Quebec filmmakers are illustrating and vibrating moviegoers around the world. We must rejoice that in recent years they have been recognized at fair value. 
Kim Nguyen and Yan England register their names alongside Frédéric Back, Denys Arcand, Philippe Falardeau, Denis Villeneuve and all others who have become, over the years, some of Quebec's most formidable ambassadors. 
It is not by chance if we shine thus everywhere in the world. It is because our ambitions are great, even if our means are modest. It is because our artists have the genius to accomplish great things with little. 
Our cinematographic productions are exceptional business cards for Quebec, for our people, to say what we are. If our cinema tells our story, it expresses more and more the look we are posing about the world. 
Let the emotion invade us. Let's be proud of the talent of our creators, recognized all over the world.
