It is for me a real pleasure to welcome Quebec the Prime Minister of the French Republic, accompanied by several ministers and a large delegation of business. 
The tradition of alternating meetings of the prime ministers testifies to the deep and durable links that unite our governments and our two nations. This relationship dates from several decades and, after the renewal breathed by General de Gaulleet Prime Minister Daniel Johnson in the sixties, she took a momentum that never denied. 
The Franco-Quebec relationship has gone through time. Despite the pitfalls, economic crises and political changes that have been crossed by our governments for 30 years, it illustrates collaboration, friendship, trust between our two states. 
We are united by a common language that comes in multiple accents, on all continents. Our respective cultures are more and more intertwined and feed on each other. In short, we have tight woven links. 
It is a balm because we know that beyond difficulties and upheaval, there is a base on which we can always support us, in difficult times as in the happiest: a relationship of solidity to Every event, a relationship that resists everything, the relationship between France and Quebec. 
Mr. Prime Minister, French friends, I wish you all the cordial and warm welcome in Quebec.
