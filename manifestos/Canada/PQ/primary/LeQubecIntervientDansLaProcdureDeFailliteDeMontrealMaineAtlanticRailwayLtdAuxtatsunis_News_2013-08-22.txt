Quebec- The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, announces his intention to intervene in the American procedure under which the US Company Montreal Maine & Atlantic Railway Ltd has been under the protection of the Chapter XI of the bankruptcy code. 
The Quebec approach aims to protect the interests of the victims, from the city of Lac-Mégantic and all Quebeckers since the Government of Quebec has made a commitment to make everything implemented for the victims to be compensated and that the costs of decontamination and reconstruction of the city center of Lac-Mégantic are not borne by the citizens of Quebec. 
Quebec took the initiative to bring together an informal creditors composed of the victims of the class of the class action, the City of Lac-Mégantic and the Government of Quebec. The members of this informal committee mandated ME Luc Despins from the Cabinet Paul Hastings to make representations before the US Tribunal and ask this Tribunal and the US Trustee to officially recognize this creditors' committee.

"The Quebec government intends to take the best measures to recover the maximum of those responsible for this tragedy. All our actions are oriented towards the ultimate profit of the victims. The team of lawyers dedicated to this task works since the first hours following the tragedy of Lac-Mégantic to ensure that the rights of the victims and citizens of Quebec are preserved, "concluded Minister Bertrand St-Arnaud.
