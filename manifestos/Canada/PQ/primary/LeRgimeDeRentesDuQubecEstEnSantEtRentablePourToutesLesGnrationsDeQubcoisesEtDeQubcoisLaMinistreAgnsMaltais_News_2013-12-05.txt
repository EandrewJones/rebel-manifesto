This document must be carried out every three years by the Régie des rentes du Québec to assess the financial situation of the regime created in 1966. 
"The Québec Pension Plan is healthy and profitable for all generations of Quebecers and Quebeckers" to explain the minister. 
"This assessment shows that the contribution rate provided for in 2017 is similar to the equilibrium contribution rate, which is an excellent new" to specify Minister Maltese. This rate stabilizes in the long run the relationship between the reserve and the outflows.
