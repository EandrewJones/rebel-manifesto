Quebec- The member for Berthier and spokesman for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, deplores that no law obliging the labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has been adopted, while A first modified genetically modified animal, the AquAdvantage salmon, has just been approved by Health Canada. 
"Last Thursday, the AquAdvantage salmon, produced by the American company Aquabounty Technologies, has become the first genetically modified animal to be approved for human consumption. However, as the labeling of GMOs is not mandatory, Quebeckers will have no way of knowing whether salmon on their base is genetically modified. The minister should have working on mandatory labeling as soon as they took office. Yet two years later, he has still not tabled anything, "said the member for Berthier. 
"The Aquabounty Technologies company predicts that genetically modified aquadvantage salmon will be produced next year. It is essential that the Minister of Agriculture guarantee Quebeckers that a law obliging the labeling of GMOs will be adopted by then. Our concern is more than justified. Let us remember that in 2003, Jean Charest was already promising Quebeckers the mandatory labeling of GMOs. In nine years in power, the Liberal Party did nothing, while today, 64 countries made this labeling mandatory, "added André Villeneuve. 
"Quebeckers do not want to wait a nine years; The Liberal Party must act now about the labeling of GMOs. Citizens want and have the right to know what is on their plate. Yet today the minister refused to make a commitment when I asked him the question. It is deplorable, "concluded the member for Berthier.
