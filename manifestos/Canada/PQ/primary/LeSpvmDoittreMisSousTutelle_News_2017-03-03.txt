Québec- The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on public safety, Pascal Bérubé, asks the Minister of Public Safety to put under guardianship the police department of the City of Montreal (SPVM). 
"It is essential to restore public confidence in this police force. This is why the Parti Québécois asks for the immediate supervision of the SPVM, the time that all light is made on the extremely serious allegations that continue to multiply in the media. The minister should not be afraid to use all possible remedies, instead of improvising by adding here and there to a police investigation on the police. He is still unable to reiterate his confidence in Philippe Pichet. If the minister does not trust, how could it be otherwise for us? He must take the situation in hand while, remember it, it is the SPVM which, from the beginning, mandated the SQ to investigate itself. We therefore propose to name the SPVM head of the people of trust to put back order into the cabin, as had been done after the Report of the Poitras Commission, "said Pascal Bérubé. 
"Since the beginning, the minister has only reacted media crises and he is now asking us to be patient. This is not that way that things will move. We therefore ask him again to entrust the investigation at the Independent Investigations Office, as Laloi allows the police. In order to restore the population, we must avoid at any price that the police investigate the police. Thus, there are only two things to do for the minister: first, he must take control of the situation with a guardianship that will guarantee the end of the irregularities and, secondly, carry out a totally independent investigation of the EIB. He must act quickly, because these allegations bear stringent work shading by many police officers, "concluded the hon. Member.
