Quebec- The hon. Member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and sentence of the official opposition on international relations, Carole Poirier, and the member for Bourget and Spokesperson for Immigration, Maka Kotto, have again asked The Minister of Immigration, Diversity and Inclusion, Kathleen Weil, to quickly issue a Quebec Certificate of Selection for Humanitarian Reasons to Mr. Raif Badawi. 
"Saudi Arabia has confirmed a few days ago the sentence of 10 years in prison, 1000 lashes and $ 300,000 a fine that it imposes on the Badawi Raif blogger. Therefore, and to make things happen, we must use all means at our disposal, even the most exceptional. That's what we asked the minister last Friday, and again this morning, "said Carole Poirier. 
"We invite the Minister of Immigration to issue a Quebec Certificate of Selection for Humanitarian Reason to Mr. Badawi in order, on the one hand, to make Mr. Badawi a real Quebec adoption, and on the other hand , to bring the federal government to invest more to concretely help this father of three children get out of this hell and find his family in Quebec, "added Maka Kotto. 
"It is very important that the Government of Quebec quickly acquiesces to our request. Thus, we will send a strong signal to support the family of Mr. Badawi and encourage Ottawa to undertake more tangible action. This deplorable case deserves that we take all possible initiatives to help this family, "concluded Carole Poirier. 
The Quebec Certificate of Selection is a document issued by the Ministry of Immigration, Diversity and Inclusion confirming the selection of a candidate for immigration wishing to settle permanently in Quebec. The Minister may decide to grant him for humanitarian grounds, accelerating the usual procedure.
