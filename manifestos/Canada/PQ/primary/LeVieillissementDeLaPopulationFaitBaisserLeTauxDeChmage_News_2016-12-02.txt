Quebec, on December 2, 2016 -The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in finance, Nicolas Marceau, and the spokesperson in Economy, Alain Therrien, denounce the attempt at the Liberal Party to appropriate the merit of the Decline in the unemployment rate in Quebec, while it results rather a mere decline in the activity rate. "As the job is stagnating in Quebec and that the number of full-time jobs has been receiving the Minister of Finance for six months, Carlos Leitão, and the Minister of Economy, Dominique Anglade, welcomed the aging of The population reduce the unemployment rate, "they declared. 
"We already knew that the Liberals were ready to say anything to hide their economic gaps, but from there to welcome themselves because fewer people can and want to work in Quebec, it's ridiculous. Since the election of the Liberals, the labor force is less numerous, so fewer workers are looking for a job. In November 2003, the activity rate was 66.5%; It is currently 64.5%. If this rate had simply maintained, nearly 140,000 more people would be available to work in Quebec. The unemployment rate is low because there are fewer workers and more retirees in Quebec. It's a simple question of demography, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
"The only thing the Liberals found to console himself, it is the unemployment rate, while economic growth slowed and that exports are recoil, as well as investment. While the government is attributing the positive effects of demographic changes, the factories close and the Minister Angle look at the train. Again this week, we learned that nearly 500 jobs will soon disappear in the manufacturing sector, due to the announced closure of the MONDELEZ plant in Montreal. The promise of Philippe Couillard to create 250,000 jobs is more distant than ever reality, "concluded Alain Therrien.
