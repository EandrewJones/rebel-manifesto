Quebec, on October 5, 2016 -The MP for Rousseau, a parliamentary leader of the official opposition and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, as well as his colleague deputy of Rosemont and spokesperson public health and prevention, Jean-François Lisé, request that the Auditor General of Quebec looks at the exploitation of video lottery (ALV) by loto-Québec, including their distribution and compliance with the rules applicable to the Crown corporation in this regard. 
"We know that ALVs, in some cases, are real machines to break lives. However, since the Minister of Finance confessed to juggle with the idea of blowing the limit of 5 devices by establishment, the disturbing facts accumulate. In fact, the more we learn about the distribution of ALVs in Quebec, the more we find that it is the FAR West, the most total confusion. Among other things, vulnerable regions, villages and neighborhoods find themselves with more ALV than allowed by Loto-Québec ", has at the outset reported Nicolas Marceau. 
"The Crown corporation has established socio-economic criteria for the distribution of ALVs, but they are not respected. How to explain, indeed, that there is 75 Alv in 8 bars in Pont-Viau? How to explain to Montreal-East, in Ville Marie or Richelieu, we do the limit of 2 aircraft by 100 inhabitants? There is definitely investigated for the Auditor General, "said Jean-François Lisée. 
Members recall that the consequences of ALVs can be dramatic. "The pathological game is a real public health problem. Let Loto-Québec lie to the Minister about the exploitation of ALVs, the minister is blindly. We can not continue to install ALV where the people most at risk live to develop an addiction that some consider as an electronic crack. The Auditor General must make all the light on this issue, "they concluded
