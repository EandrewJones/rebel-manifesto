On March 18th, the symposium will be held at the Regions√† Rimouski. Although organized by the Quebecois Party of Rimouski and Bas-Saint-Laurent, this event was open to all to discuss the challenges of the regions of Quebec. 
With a large participation and rewarding debates, we present the proceedings of the symposium which, we hope, reflect the reflections and testimonies as faithfully as possible at this event.
