Quebec- The member for Saint John and the official opposition spokesperson for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, says that contrary to what the Minister François Blais, yesterday. These are not all young people who will continue to receive the Youth-Emploi Train Services (CJE). 
"The government has imposed CJE conditions. The result is clear for everyone, except for the minister: young people will be excluded from the services offered by the CEPs. It is nice to broadcast communiqués saying that everything is fine, it's not the reality. The reform leaves youth side. Yet, in the current context - where the losses of jobs accumulate in all regions of Quebec and where the number of young people in social assistance increased by 14.4% in one year - more than ever young people need all possible services to integrate the labor market, "said Dave Turcotte. 
For example, the CJE Papineau, in Outaouais, states that with the reform, only 25% of its clientele can continue to be welcomed. The North-Du-Québec, North Shore, Chaudière-Appalaches, Gaspésie, Madeleine Islands and Abitibi-Témiscamingue will see their budget amputated by 10%. 
"With these budget cuts, how are you going to help all young people? On the ground, the harmful effects of liberal austerity are visible. All young people between 16 and 35 years old must have access to quality services. The CJE mission change goes in the wrong direction. Unfortunately, he was imposed on these organizations, despite the strong opposition, throughout Quebec, "concluded Dave Turcotte.
