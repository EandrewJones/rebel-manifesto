Montreal- While a new coalition of parents for the maintenance of school transportation is formed in the Montreal region, the spokesperson for the Quebec's education and deputy of Lac-Saint-Jean, Alexandre Cloutier, is due to offer him his support, as well as that of the Parti Québécois. 
"I met the coalition Monday, Montreal. These parents are exceeded by the loss of school transport services in the metropolitan area. Nearly 700 students from three Montreal special schools could be deprived of school transportation next September. With the accumulation of liberal cuts, school boards must now cut into school transport; it's foolish! "Exposed the member for Lac-Saint-Jean. 
Like many other groups that form to denounce education cuts since the arrival of the liberals in power, these parents have no choice but to mobilize to defend these essential services for their children. 
"The contribution required to maintain school transportation could reach $ 600 per child. Such a tariff - or, worse, the total absence of school transport - would create a two-speed public system. These supposedly public schools would be accessible only to children whose parents can pay the invoice. The government must review its financing to ensure the universal accessibility of public schools to all Quebeckers, "concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
