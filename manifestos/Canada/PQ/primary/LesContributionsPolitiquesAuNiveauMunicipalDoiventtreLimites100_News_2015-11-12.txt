Québec- On October 19th, a dozen municipal elected officials became federal deputies. Several partial elections will therefore be triggered in these municipalities. The member for Jonquière and spokesman for the Parti Québécois on municipal affairs, Sylvain Gaudreault, asks the Government to call Bill 53, in connection with political financing at this level. 
"I tabled Bill 53 when I was Minister of Municipal Affairs, a week after the 2013 municipal elections. We wanted, at the time, that the municipal elected officials are subject to the same rules as the elected representatives of the National Assembly, bringing back the maximum threshold of donations to $ 100. Thus, we wanted to make sure that the influence of money on our decision-makers is reduced to its maximum. But the election of the Liberals and the appointment of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Pierre Moreau, have made the file has been tablette, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
After scandals surrounding political financing, including in Laval, Montreal, Boisbriand and Mascouche, the government of the Parti Québécois had passed Law 26, introducing a transitional regime for municipal political funding for the elections of 2013. regime passed the donations of individuals from $ 1,000 to $ 300. Subsequently, we had proposed a permanent funding plan, through Bill 53. 
"From 2012 to 2014, we did the housework that the Liberals have always refused to do. Since then, we are returning to the good old liberal regime. The report of the Charbonneau Commission is coming, and partial elections will soon be triggered in several municipalities. Minister Moreau should send a strong signal against corruption, but he does all the opposite: he refused this morning to commit to limiting $ 100 donations to the municipal. It's time to act. I offer all my collaboration to the minister to pass Bill 53 before Christmas, "concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
