Quebec- In the company of representatives of Montreal community organizations, the member for Rosemont and spokespersons of the Parti Québécois in social services, youth protection, home care and prevention, Jean-François Lisée, and the Member of Parliament for Vachon, Martine Ouellet, participated today in Montreal at the event "The Vulnerable Parade", initiated by the regional table of the community organizations of the Montérégie as well as that of the Center-du-Québec and the Mauricie. 
"We join our voices to that of the community environment to denounce once again the liberal austerity measures that particularly affect the most vulnerable of our fellow citizens. Since the arrival of this government, doctors have been entitled to the return of the bolduc premium, the billing of ancillary fees, and even increases of compensation of $ 148.5 million, according to the recent report of the Auditor General . But community organizations, they have seen their budget stagnate and, in parallel, the number of people who are victims of austerity that bind to their door continues to increase. The government must recognize their contribution and cease to discharge themselves on them without joining the necessary means, "said Jean-François Lisée. 
"Community organizations are those who support and accompany the vulnerable people in the field. They are faced daily to all the impacts of the liberal cuts, and it is surreal to ask them to meet the growing demand with indexed budgets of barely 1%. As a Montérégie as in Montreal, Mauricie and Center-du-Québec, the needs are shy and the government must cease its austerity measures. We walk alongside the middle actors today, so that the funding of community organizations is enhanced, as Liberal members have themselves claimed in May 2013 by unanimously voting in favor of a motion. The Prime Minister must finally respect his word and protect the most vulnerable, as he had engaged in his opening speech, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
