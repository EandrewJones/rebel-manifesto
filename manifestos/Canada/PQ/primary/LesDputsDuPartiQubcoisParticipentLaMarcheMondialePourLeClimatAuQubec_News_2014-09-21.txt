Quebec- On the occasion of the World Walk for the Climate in Quebec, members of the Parti Québécois will join their voices to that of thousands of citizens in favor of the fight against climate change. 
The member for Jonquière and the official opposition spokeswoman in sustainable development and the environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, wishes to recall that Quebec must continue its efforts in the fight against climate change. He participates in the march held in Tadoussac for the protection and preservation of the St. Lawrence River and the species that depend on it, in the context of the TransCanada pipeline project. 
"We have the power to become a leader in this struggle. Quebec must make one's own decisions about what is happening on its territory. The environment is of the competence of the state of Quebec, "he said. 
Held in the climate summit, which will take place in New York next Tuesday, the World March mobilizes the population in more than 130 countries. The citizens of about twenty Quebec cities join. 
"This march is also an opportunity to remind the Minister of Sustainable Development, the Environment and the fight against climate change than the environmental rules of Quebec must be respected and that it is its responsibility to ensure it. In the TransCanada pipeline file, we have repeatedly asked the minister to stop co-cacouna work and immediately hold a BAPE on the entire project. Will Minister Strength finally listen? "Concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
