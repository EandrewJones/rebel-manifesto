The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesman of the Parti Québécois in the field of school education and perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, asks the Minister of Education to review his school transportation to ensure that schools at Special vocation of the Montreal School Board (CSDM) remain accessible to all students, regardless of their situation. 
"Nearly 700 students attending special public schools will be deprived of school transportation for the next year. This is another consequence of the repeated cuts of the Liberal government in the budgets of our education system. After the direct services to the students, the network is made to cut in school transport. It is deplorable, "said Alexandre Cloutier. 
Parents of students who attend schools face, workshop and Fernand-Seguin in Montreal have just learned this news. Despite their mobilization and their efforts, the Minister of Education remained from ice in the face of their request. 
"The minister can not stay the arms crossed. He must quickly review his school transportation. The Quebec government has chosen to open public schools with particular vocation; It is therefore his duty to ensure that they are accessible to all students by providing adequate transport. The current situation places parents in front of an impossible choice for the next school year: that of uprooting their children or making feet and hands to transport them morning and evening. This shows us, once again, that education is unfortunately far from being a priority for this government, "said the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
