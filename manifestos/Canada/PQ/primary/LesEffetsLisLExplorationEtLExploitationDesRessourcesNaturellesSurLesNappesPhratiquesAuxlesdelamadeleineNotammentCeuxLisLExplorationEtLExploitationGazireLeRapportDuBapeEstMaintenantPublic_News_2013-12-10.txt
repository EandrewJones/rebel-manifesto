Quebec- At the request of the Minister of Sustainable Development, the Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Yves-Fran√ßois Blanchet, the Office of Public Hearings on the Environment (BAPE) makes public today its report investigation and public hearing on the effects of exploring and exploiting natural resources on groundwater in the Madeleine Islands, including those related to gas exploration and exploitation. This mandate of investigation and public hearing began on May 14th. The commission of inquiry was presided over by Michel Germain who was seconded by Commissioner Jacques Locat. 
The BAPE Commission of Inquiry concludes that the territory of the Madeleine Islands is, by definition, an island space with its specificities, including a relatively small living space, a fragile ecological environment and an important remoteness of the major urban centers of Quebec. The Madelinot archipelago therefore appears more vulnerable than all other communities in Quebec, economic, social and environmental points of view. In this respect, the aquifers are irreplaceable, as they constitute the only source of drinking water of good quality, available at reasonable cost. 
As a result, the water resources of the archipelago should be covered by enhanced regulations. In addition, these could be protected by the implementation of management and conservation plans administered by an established body, including the future regional dialogue table for the St. Lawrence Islands Integrated Management of the Madeleine Islands. 
In addition, the Ministry of Sustainable Development, the Environment, Wildlife and Parks should participate in the process of granting licenses for drilling and completion of the gas and oil wells, including if there was well stimulus, Given the fragility of the drinking water supply of the archipelago. 
The use of fossil fuels is omnipresent on the Madelinot territory. A reduction in their use would be beneficial for the protection of groundwater. A specific energy strategy for the Madeleine Islands deserves to be developed because it could help reduce the presence of these fuels. The commission of inquiry encourages Madelinots to continue the development of this strategy. 
Finally, the Commission emphasizes that Madelinots want to have a say in the place that the gas and oil industry could take without compromising the sustainability of natural and human enhancements and without weakening existing economic activities, including tourism and fisheries. 
Remember that during the first part of the public hearing the Commission held five public sessions in the North Pond. In the second part, two public meetings allowed the Commission to attend the presentation of 16 memoirs and 6 verbal opinions. In total, 24 memoirs were deposited by persons, groups, organizations and municipalities interested in this subject. 
The investigation and public hearing report on the effects related to the exploration and exploitation of natural resources on groundwater in the Madeleine Islands, including those related to exploration and gas exploitation is now available.
