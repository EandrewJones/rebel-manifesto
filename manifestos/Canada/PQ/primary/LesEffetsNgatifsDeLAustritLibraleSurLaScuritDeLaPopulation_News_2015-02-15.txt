Quebec- The member for Sanguinet and official opposition spokesperson for the Treasury Board, Alain Therrien, denounces the restrictions of the President of the Treasury Board, Martin Caiteous, imposed on the employees of the State concerning their displacements; We are starting to see the negative impacts on the safety of citizens. 
"Since November 25, employees' movements are strongly limited; In fact, they stay in their offices, and the effects of this austerity measure begin to be felt. Citizen safety can be compromised, for example when inspectors in public safety fires can no longer move into seniors centers to ensure that they meet standards, or when MAPAQ inspectors do not meet can more inspections in restaurants. People responsible for the application and respect for our laws must be able to go on the ground, "said Alain Therrien. 
The member is also referring to other departments, who must apply the same directive: 
"What Martin Cloupeux made the move on and forcing the deputy minister's authorization to refuel the ministry's cars," it's called missing discernment, do not see further than the tip of his nose. It must now correct the situation so that people who work to enforce our laws can properly fulfill their tasks. The minister must reassure Quebeckers, who today find the effects of austerity on their safety and their environment, "concluded Alain Therrien.
