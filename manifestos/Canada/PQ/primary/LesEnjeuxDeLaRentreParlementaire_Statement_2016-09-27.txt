During the last parliamentary session, the Liberal Party once again demonstrated its inability to meet the needs of the population and work with the other parties. Faced with a government also disconnected from reality, we are committed to redoubling efforts to serve the interests of all Quebeckers. 
The Parti Québécois is above all a Party of Transparency, existing for all Quebeckers. That's why we wanted, through this blog ticket, present the big issues of the upcoming session. 
The health of citizens and citizens. Contramement that the Minister Barrette can affirm, it is no longer time to merge the structures. The government must begin taking into consideration the millions of Quebecers still having no family doctor, the times of hours of hours of emergency services or citizens who are not covered by our health system. The Parti Québécois is committed to doing everything so that the services you are entitled to be accessible and quality. 
Accessible education for all. The cuts made by the Liberal Party in the budget allocated to educational institutions show how much this government does not consider education as a priority. The Parti Québécois will ensure that liberal cuts do not make access to knowledge more difficult. 
In this return of parliamentary year, we are aware of the responsibility that is ours. Our commitment remains intact: in the face of the Liberal government's policy, we will not cease to defend Quebecers and their interests. 
Thank you for your support, we are indispensable, 
The Parti Québécois team.
