Quebec, August 16, 2016 -The member for Sanguinet and spokesman for the Energy and Natural Resources Party, Alain Therrien, claims the immediate split of Bill 106, An Act respecting the implementation of the policy Energy 2030 and amending various legislative provisions. 
"It is contradictory to include a project on hydrocarbons in a bill on the transition of Quebec to clean energies, the essence of Bill 106. It is essential to separate the two issues. Indeed, the issue of hydrocarbons is particularly complex and deserves a debate in itself, regardless of all other measures contained in Bill 106, "said the member for Sanguinet. 
"In fact, in a project on hydrocarbons, it would have been essential to find the criteria on which the government is based on whether, yes or no, a project can move forward, but it is not not the case. For companies in the hydrocarbons sector, as for municipalities and citizens concerned, uncertainty is total; On what criteria will the government be based to accept or refuse a project? ", Also asked Alain Therrien. 
"That said, during future consultations, we will try to get clarifications about many issues. We also believe that it is essential that the government expand consultations and agrees to invite all of the groups, companies, municipalities and interested citizens, "said the spokesper.
