Quebec- The member for Rousseau and the official opposition spokesperson for Finance and Economic Development, Nicolas Marceau, reproach Jean Charest and François Legault to want to overcome the families of the middle class by maintaining the health tax. 
"Rather than recognizing that the Health Tax imposed by the Liberal government in 2010 was a very bad idea, Jean Charest and François Legault are coming to Piger in the pocket of the families of the middle class, already quite victims of multiple rates. during the last years. Unlike the Liberals and the Cavoists, the Parti Québécois intends to help the middle class; We will abolish the health tax, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
For two years the official opposition denounces this regressive tax that does not take into account taxpayers' income. "It makes no sense that those who have an annual income of $ 30,000 pay the same amount as those who earn $ 1 million," continued Nicolas Marceau. By abolishing the health tax, middle class families would benefit from $ 400 to complete their budget. 
The member for Rousseau still does not come back to hear Liberal MPs maintaining that $ 400 is an easy money. "Loose a family budget has become more and more difficult. The Liberals of Jean Charest have painted so much in the pocket of Quebeckers that they do not realize the harmful effect that this represents. What is disturbing is that François Legault seems to want to do worse than the Liberals, "the spokesman noted. 
"The Parti Québécois believes that those who have the financial means must take their fair share of the health fund, according to their income. It's simple to understand, but François Legault's CAQ and Jean Charest's Liberals argue that it is up to the middle class to pay. They will have to explain their choice, "concluded Nicolas Marceau.
