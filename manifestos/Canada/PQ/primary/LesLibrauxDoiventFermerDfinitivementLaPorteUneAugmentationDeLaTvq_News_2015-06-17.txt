Quebec- The member for Rousseau and the official opposition for the finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, asks the Government to give up once and to increase the QST, such that the Minister desired the Minister Finance, Carlos Leit√£o, in recent days. 
Yesterday, the Minister of Finance reiterated his intention to raise the consumer tax, as proposed by the Quebec Tax Review Board, set up by the Liberal government and chaired by economist Luc Godbout. "Quebec is already one of the states where the consumer tax is highest in North America. An increase in QST would be aware of the progressivity of our tax system and our economy, "said Nicolas Marceau, recalling at the same time as our retailers already suffer from the competition generated by neighboring jurisdictions and online trade. 
"The Liberals promise tax cuts for 10 years, but rather govern the tax burden of families. Never, at the last election campaign, the Liberal Party has spoken to raise taxes; On the contrary, it was elected by promising a decline in the tax burden. A year later, families saw the rates and several taxes increase, without ever seeing the color of the liberal promises. Remember that in the past, the Liberal government has increased the TVQ of two points, but has never diminished Quebec's tax, "continued the member. 
In addition to being unfair and to stifle the middle class, the increase of the QST is ineffective to increase the income of the state. Indeed, the last increases in the TVQ imposed by the Liberals have not reported the expected revenues. People have turned more on online business, especially, to escape taxation. Note that the GODBOUT report provides no solution to this problem. 
"The government has not yet filed economic policy worthy of the name. The middle class and low-income households have already contributed sufficiently to return to budget balance. It is now the Government's turn to take concrete steps to stimulate the economy and employment, "concluded Nicolas Marceau.
