Quebec- The member for Saint John and official opposition spokesperson for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, denounces the insensitivity of the Liberal government, which refused to Support a motion asking him to commit to maintaining youth forums and their funding. 
"After he refused to reassure the artisans of the youth forums, after he has evaded my questions yesterday we finally see the reality, since the Liberal government rejected our motion. I ask him to stop maintaining the uncertainty in this file, and this, a good time for all. When will he give the time just to the young people of the forums, who are involved in their environment to change things? Asked Dave Turcotte. 
The motion rejected by the Liberals reads as follows: 
"That the National Assembly confirms the importance of youth forums, genuine citizenship learning institutions, working, since their creation, to provide a place of commitment to young people in Quebec; 
That it affirms their essential character for regional development, allowing all young people in Quebec to contribute to the development of their society; 
That the National Assembly asks the Government to commit to maintaining the youth forums as well as their financing. Â» 
"Youth forums are of paramount importance in regional development and the citizen involvement of young people in public life. It is deplorable that the government has decided to abolish them, and insulting that it has slipped into the key stakeholders, "concluded Dave Turcotte.
