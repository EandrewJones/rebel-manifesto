Quebec- The member for Saint-Jean and the official opposition spokesman for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, as well as the member for Verchères and spokesperson Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, deplore that the Liberal government and the CAQ refused to support Quebec workers at the filing this morning of a motion on employment insurance. 
"The Liberal government and the CAQ refused to support our motion that denounced service Canada's practices that officials discourage unemployed workers to claim benefits. These two parties have decided to support Canada and federalism instead of Quebec workers; this is unacceptable! These people are entitled to their benefits, and it is completely illogical that officials do not support them, "said Dave Turcotte. 
"The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, François Blais, must intervene with his federal counterpart so that these practices cease. Once again, Ottawa undermines workers on the employment insurance file. This bad habit is unfortunately not a novelty, but the Quebec government has the duty to intervene to defend our workers, "added Stéphane Bergeron. 
The motion rejected by the PLQ and the CAQ reads as follows: 
"That the National Assembly disapproves of the federal government's practices related to employment insurance reform that encourages Service Canada employees to make every effort to discourage unemployed workers to claim benefits; 
Whether it asks the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity to intervene with his federal counterpart so that he abandons these practices. »
