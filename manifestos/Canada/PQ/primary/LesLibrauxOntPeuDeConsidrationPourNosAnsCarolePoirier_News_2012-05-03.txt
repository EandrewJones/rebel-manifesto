Quebec- The member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesman for the official opposition for seniors, Carole Poirier, is discouraged from the void that emerges from the announcement made by Minister Blais. "It's as if the government said" quickly, it is necessary to seem to be activated for seniors "and that he had improvised a plan from a collection of measures that actually seem good Only for electoral purposes, but who ultimately do not meet the urgent needs of our elders, "said Carole Poirier. 
The Parti Québécois has registered the 200,000 hours of home care for months, the many cases of negligence in private residences and CHSLD as well as gaps in the training of staff and the organization of care. 
This policy does not have the problems raised by the Protector of the Citizen last month. "The erratic management of this government in home support services, the ceiling of hours of care, non-compliance with expert assessments of the needs of vulnerable persons and regional inequities remain realities for which the government does not bring No immediate solutions, "continued the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. 
"It is shameful to spend five years preparing a plan as empty of financial means. Has the Minister Blais so little listened to the President of the Treasury Board? Do not the liberal priorities include the well-being of our elders? Is Jean Charest insensitive to the legitimate demand of seniors to age at home? ", Questioned Carole Poirier. 
"Long before the Blais minister does not present his policy, the Parti Québécois has made clear and strong proposals to take care of our elders, including the creation of a network of care and home services and a fund autonomy, In addition to the adoption of a real policy on aging and seniors, "said Carole Poirier.
