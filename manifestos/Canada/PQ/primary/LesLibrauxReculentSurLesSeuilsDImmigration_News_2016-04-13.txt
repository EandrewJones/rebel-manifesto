Quebec- The Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, and the spokesman for the Parti Québécois in immigration and cultural communities, Maka Kotto, finally see the decline of Liberal Prime Minister Philippe Couillard as to the rise in Immigration thresholds. 
"We are witnessing the festival of contradiction. In the balance sheet Philippe Couillard by his government, he reiterated his intention to raise the immigration thresholds to 60,000. To explain his decision, he said Quebec needed to increase his labor force. But his minister of immigration, Kathleen Weil, affirmed the opposite. The Prime Minister finally visiting obviously, declined. As we have been telling her for weeks that increases the thresholds was not reasonable, because of our integration capacity, he finally heard this morning, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
The members of the Parti Québécois recall that it was not the first time the Prime Minister claimed his desire to increase the thresholds at 60,000. He did it in June 2015, at a congress, and he reiterated when filing the new immigration, participation and inclusion policy. One can even read, in this policy, that "from a level of 60,000 immigrants admitted annually, Quebec would avoid a decline in its working-age population." 
"The question of integration is paramount and sensitive, in terms of work and that of francization, in particular. We have a duty to adequately occupy ourselves adequately from those who are already here and to whom the Liberal government is sentenced to providing tangible responses to the francization, employment and recognition of achievements; Of those who have made the choice of Quebec and who must integrate as best as possible to our society. While his policy says the opposite, the minister must specify his intentions as to the thresholds to be reached, "added Maka Kotto.
