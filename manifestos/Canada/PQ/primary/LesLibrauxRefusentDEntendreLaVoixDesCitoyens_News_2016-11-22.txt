Quebec at the end of this parliamentary session and after more than 30 months of liberal governance, the parliamentary leader of the official opposition, Pascal Bérubé, denounces the repeated refusal of the Liberal government to hear the voices of the citizens who use the citizens who use the citizens who use the citizens who use the citizens who use the citizens who use the citizens who use the citizens who use the citizens who use the citizens who use the citizens who use the citizens who use the citizens who use the citizens who use the citizens who use the citizens who use the citizens who use the petitions to advance ideas. 
"On some 400 petitions filed at the National Assembly since the month of April 2014, the Liberals have consented once only to the members of a parliamentary committee provide a follow-up to a petition and an initiative mandate in connection with this one. At more than 60 times, members gathered in working session and the Liberals used their majority to beat motions requiring hearings to be held. The petition acceptance rate is 1.6%, "Pascal Bérubé exposed. 
"In 2009, all the parties wanted, in a non-partisan manner, to reform our parliamentary rules by pursuing, in particular, the objective of bringing the National Assembly closer to the citizens. To get there, we put in place tools to revalue the right to petition. However, if the government is constantly using its majority to block citizen initiatives, the goal will never be achieved, "also denounced the parliamentary leader. 
"After repeating many times that citizens have their say more than once in the four years, it is high time for the Liberal government that gestures follow the commitments: it must accept and take into account the tools and the tools and Processes that have been made available to elected officials to bring the voice of citizens, "concluded Pascal Bérubé.
