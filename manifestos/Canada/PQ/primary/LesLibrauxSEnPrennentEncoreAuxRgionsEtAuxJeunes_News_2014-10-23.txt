Quebec, October 23, 2014 -The MP for Saint John and Official Opposition Spokesperson for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, denounces liberal attacks on youth crossings -Employment (CJE). 
"Once again, the Liberal government tackles the Quebec model and sacrifices young people in Quebec. It is a real disorganization of the services that is announced. Since their creation in 1995 by the Parti Québécois, CEPs have developed youth-oriented expertise in all regions of Quebec. Now it's job-Québec that will choose customers to refer them. The strength of the CJE lies in their flexibility and accessibility, which allow them to help a large number of young people with literacy, dependence and intimidation problems, or who would be tempted to unhook, "said Dave Turcotte.
