Quebec, August 16, 2016 -The member for René-Lévesque and spokesman for the Parti Quebecois on municipal affairs, Martin Ouellet, and the member for Richelieu and Experience in Work, Sylvain Rochon, denounce the fact That the only consequence of Bill 110, An Act respecting the negotiating system of collective agreements and dispute settlement in the municipal sector, it will be to increase the powers of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Martin Coiteous. 
"The minister has created false expectations to municipalities. The cities of Montreal and Quebec City, as well as the Quebec Federation of Municipalities and the Union of Quebec Municipalities, call for substantial changes to Bill 110. For their part, trade union groups openly say they will challenge the law. . Because all the bill will do is give more power to the minister. It is foolish, "said the hon. Member for René-Lévesque. 
"Imagine: the Labor Code is being rewritten through a municipal affairs bill, and the Ministry of Labor has been kept away from the process," has illustrated the Member of Parliament for Richelieu. 
"Finally, remember that if the government has succeeded in concluding the most recent tax pact with cities, despite cuts of $ 300 million a year that it imposed on them is only because it had committed to file this bill. However, it is now clear that he broke his promise, in addition to generating huge fears on the side of the municipal employees, since nobody knows what the Coiteous Minister will make new powers he gives himself ", concluded Martin Ouellet.
