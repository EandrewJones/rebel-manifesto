It is with astonishment that we learn this morning that international student inscriptions exploded in the Cégep campus of the unilingual English speaking Gaspésie in Montreal, from 50 students to more than 3,000. 
This increasing trend towards the opening of bilingual and unilingual programs testifies to a much deeper evil: the underfunding of educational institutions, particularly in the region, and unfair competition between our Francophone and Anglophone educational institutions . The disturbance of the tuition fees of international students granted by the Liberals led exactly to the expected result: the English-speaking institutions located in Montreal proliferate by attracting English-speaking foreign students to whom they can charge exorbitant tuition fees, to the detriment of the institutions Francophones in the region. Francophone school institutions are therefore encouraged to offer programs in English, in order to remain competitive and get to go to the end of the month. As a result, the programs offered in English in our Francophone institutions will be more and more numerous, with the foreseeable consequences of this Anglicisation for the sustainability of our language. International students are welcome in Quebec. However, it is imperative that these are encouraged to study and integrate into French. 
The disturbance of tuition fees for foreign students is not the solution to a lack of chronic network financing. The Anglication of our institutions and the consequences that will have for the sustainability of French in Quebec are unacceptable. It is time for the Ministry of Education and Higher Education to make its homework and restore the rules of the equitable game between institutions belonging to English and Francophone education systems.
