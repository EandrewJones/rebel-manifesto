Quebec- "Every day, community organizations are working with families from across Quebec. Whether for parental mutual aid, training workshops, homework assistance, community facilitation, cultural or family activities, these organizations help support Quebec's parents. In order to continue their mission, family organizations must obtain from the next budget a better financial support. » 
This is what the member for Iberville and spokesman of the Parti Québécois in family, Marie Bouille, in response to the request of the family organizations who demand an improvement in their financing. The representatives of these family organizations were present this morning at the National Assembly for the deposit of a petition of nearly 10,000 signatories requesting a bonus of their financial support. 
"In anticipation of the elaboration of the next budget, the Minister of Family must assert the requests from family organizations to the Minister of Finance. It is his responsibility and she must do it now, "concluded Marie Bouille.
