Qu√©bec- "How can we compare this point in statistics to become blind to reality," denounced the hon. Member for Saint-Hyacinthe and official opposition spokesperson for persons with disabilities, Emilian Pelletier, in reaction At the answers of the minister come to the questions he asked him in the House this morning regarding access to services for people with disabilities. 
"People with disabilities and their families are confronted with various issues: difficulties of access to specialized services, cuts in home services, waiting times, inaccessibility of public transport and several public places. The minister must stop turning a deaf ear and act without delay, "said Emilien Pelletier. 
Yesterday, the Human Rights and Youth Rights Commission confirmed the persistence of inequities and barriers to overcome for the employment integration of people with disabilities. To achieve the objectives set, the public bodies of Quebec are expected to triple the representation of persons with disabilities within their workforce in the coming years. 
"The situation is worrying. Whether in terms of employment or access to services, everything must be implemented so that equality becomes reality for disabled people in Quebec, "concluded Emilien Pelletier.
