Quebec- "Is the Prime Minister of Alberta, Jim Prentice, is listed as Lobbyist for TransCanada? Prime Minister Philippe Couillard must make him very clear that Quebec will never give up his power to decide on the environment, "said the member for Jonqui√®re and the official opposition spokeswoman in the field of sustainable development and Environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, on the occasion of the visit to Quebec Prime Minister Alberta. 
The member also asks the Prime Minister not to commit to anything with his Alberta counterpart concerning the Energy project is before the BAPE completed its assessment. "The Liberal government must mandate a BAPE without delay throughout the project, in order to evaluate the impacts throughout the pipe. Moreover, Ontario has started this work several months ago. Only Quebec can decide what is happening on its territory, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
In addition, the Committee on the Situation of Species at Risk in Canada (COSEWIC) concluded yesterday that belugas are now an endangered species. At Cacouna, the work is arrested. 
"This undermines the respect of a condition of Minister David Heurtel, that of the highest standards in the environment, and it is not acceptable. If Quebec applies the precautionary principle, the work should not be allowed again. The Prime Ministers of the Canadian Provinces and Prime Minister Stephen Harper have been saying that they want, Quebec must decide alone what is happening on its territory and we will be there to repeat it, "concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
