Québec- The member for Taillon and sentence of the official opposition in terms of health and accessibility to care, Diane Lamarre, and the member for Rosemont and spokesperson for social services, Jean-François Lisée, s The worry of gaps suffered by health services and social services, highlighted by the citizen protector in his report published this morning. 
The Protector Report focuses on several important equity issues in access to health care and social services, particularly with regard to free care and medicine as well as the quality of living environments offered In mental health accommodation resources. 
"It's very worrying and contrary to the principle of equity that all Quebeckers do not have access to the same care according to the regions, and that some pay for a medicine while others receive it for free. In addition, in the field of health, four of the six recommendations of the Protector concern people with mental health problems or cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Like what the Parti Québécois had decided, priority must be given to a mental health policy. These vulnerable people are often unfit to defend themselves alone. They deserve to be protected, "said Diane Lamarre. 
"When talking about accommodation, the lack of accompaniment offered to people with intellectual or physical disabilities is simply aberrant. Young people and adults are forced to turn to the CHSLDs, altogether inadequate living environments for them. As for the intermediate resources, the protector highlights the lack of training and supervision of professionals who work there; Nothing to reassure us. Finally, with respect to home care, we share the great concern of the protector, who finds a lack of resources and breaks of services. It is unacceptable, and I reiterate that the Liberal government must come out of its lethargy and put the bonus of home care on the agenda, "said Jean-François Lisée.
