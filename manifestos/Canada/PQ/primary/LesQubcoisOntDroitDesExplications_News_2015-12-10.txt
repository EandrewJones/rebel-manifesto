Quebec- dissatisfied with the lack of public explanations regarding the conclusions of the Charbonne Report, the leader of the official opposition and spokesperson for the Quebecois party on ethics, Bernard Drainville, asks the Government to acquiesce at its request In order for the members of the Committee on Institutions to hear the Chairperson on the Granting and Management of Public Contracts in the construction industry (CEIC), France Charbonneau, as well as Commissioner Renaud Lachance. 
According to Drainville, the dissent context in which this report has been produced has undermined the process and has serious doubts about its validity. All the light must be made, not only on the dissent between the members of the Commission, but also on the financing of the Liberal Party of Quebec, which is too good. "Quebeckers are indignant. They have the impression of having made himself and wonder if they have paid $ 45 million for a commission that has finally served to whiten the Liberal Party, "said the member for Marie-Victorin. 
The Leader of the Official Opposition therefore requested that the members of the Committee on Institutions be brought together in order to hear, as soon as possible, the President of the CEIC, France Charbonneau, as well as Commissioner Renaud Lachance. "We believe that it is our responsibility to ensure that all the issues raised by the work and the CEIC's report will have an answer, particularly as to the reasons that led Mr. Lachance to express his dissent on a significant portion of the conclusions of the Commission. We must do everything to understand what happened and ensure that this exercise, which cost Quebeckers millions of dollars, has not been futile, "concluded the spokesperson.
