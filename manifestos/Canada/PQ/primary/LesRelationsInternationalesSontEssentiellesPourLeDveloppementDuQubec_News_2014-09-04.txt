Quebec- The hon. Member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and sentence of the official opposition on international relations, Carole Poirier, denounces the intention of the Liberal government to transform the Ministry of International Relations and the Francophonie (Mrif) in secretariat . 
"It's purely ideological. The Liberals use fiscal austerity to justify cuts to reduce the powers of Quebec, with the tacit support of the CAQ. For Philippe Couillard, Quebec must only be a Canadian province like the others. Remove the Mrif, it is to reduce the influence of Quebec abroad, not only culturally, but also economically. Quebec's international relations are not partisan; They are in the interest of all Quebeckers, "said Carole Poirier. 
The hon. Member recalls that the doctrine GÃ©rin-Lajoie, on the international extension of the internal powers of Quebec, has been promoted and supported by all the governments who have succeeded since 1965. The Liberal Party would thus end up decades of Quebec action abroad. 
"The Mrif is a development tool for Quebec. Without him, could Quebec have been able to advance the record of cultural diversity? Could Quebec have influenced free trade agreements with Europe, or hundreds of bilateral agreements with as many countries? , Added the member. 
According to Carole Poirier, the Liberal government once again demonstrates its lack of vision for the future of Quebec. "International action is what has allowed our creators, our businesses and our artists to grow and grow on the world stage. I ask the Prime Minister to clearly affirm that the MRIF will not be transformed into a secretariat, and will retain its status and all its powers, "she concluded.
