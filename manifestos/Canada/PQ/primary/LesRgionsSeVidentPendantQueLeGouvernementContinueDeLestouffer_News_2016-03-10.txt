Québec- The Quebec Party spokesperson for the development of regions and fisheries, Gaétan Lelièvre, accompanied by several of his colleagues, was disastered by the figures of the most recent demographic assessment of the Quebec resource regions. 
Indeed, the data from the Quebec Institute of Statistics (ISQ), as to the situation of our regions, are alarming. The Abitibi-Témiscamingue, the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, the North Shore, the Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine and the Bas-Saint-Laurent show negative demographic reports. Despite this, the government continues to demonstrate, day after day, its indifference for the file and its incomprehension of reality on the ground. 
"All resource regions show a negative demographic record for the last year. While our regions are empty, the Liberals continue to put the ax in their development tools. The ISQ figures are, however, tangible proof that their marketing plans, the North Plan and the maritime strategy, are only powder in the eyes and do not bring anything positive for our regions. It is even the opposite effect that occurs: While the Liberals focus on their advertising strategies, they leave the areas die, "said Gaétan Lelièvre. 
"It is particularly easy to demonstrate that the Liberals do not understand the regions: the Minister of Occupancy of the Territory and the Minister responsible for Regional Economic Development are two elected representatives of the island of Montreal. In short, rising, the Council of Ministers, to defend our regions? Who knows their reality? Asked Gaétan Lelièvre. 
"The government has the duty to listen to regional stakeholders to deliver a real resource regional development strategy. In addition, concrete measures must quickly be launched to promote their socio-economic growth, "concluded the deputy of Gaspé.
