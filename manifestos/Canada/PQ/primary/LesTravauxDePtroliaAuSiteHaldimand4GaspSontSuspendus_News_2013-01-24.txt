Québec - The Quebec government has obtained the insurance of the Petrolia company that it will not go forward with its drilling work at the Haldimand 4 site in Gaspé in the current context. The Government wishes to salute this decision of the Pétrolia company that will better identify all the issues involved. 
"The Haldimand 4 project in Gaspé comes up against several obstacles and we believe that as ahead in this context could have been harmful for all the actors concerned. I repeat, we want the oil to use in Quebec to be harmoniously, "said the Minister of Natural Resources, Mrs. Martine Ouellet. 
The Government reiterated its opening to the development of the oil sector in Quebec - especially at the island of Anticosti whose potential appears very high - but it intends to do it from the highest practices for the protection of the environment and with the goal that Quebeckers find their account. These principles will guide government actions and will need to be applied throughout the territory. 
"My colleague from the Department of Natural Resources (MNR) and I agreed to quickly initiate a process aimed at ensuring better monitoring of the entire oil industry. MNR will take care of the hydrocarbon aspects and the Ministry of Sustainable Development, the Environment, Wildlife and Parks will focus on groundwater protection issues and drinking water sources, "reiterated the Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet. 
According to the two ministers: "The exploitation of natural resources has been at the heart of the Quebec economy for many years. But more than ever, we need to focus on responsible development for our resources. It is the challenge that awaits Quebeckers and to which their government is committed to working. "
