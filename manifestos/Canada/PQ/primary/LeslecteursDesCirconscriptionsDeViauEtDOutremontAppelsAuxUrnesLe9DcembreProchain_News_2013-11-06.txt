Quebec- The Quebec Prime Minister Pauline Marois announces that the Council of Ministers has adopted the decree authorizing two partial elections, in the constituencies of Viau and Outremont on December 9. 
Ms. Marois also confirms that the Parti Québécois will not present a candidate in the constituency of Outremont in order to allow the leader of the Liberal Party, Philippe Couillard, to enter the National Assembly. 
Remember that partial elections are made necessary in these constituencies because of the departure of MPs Raymond Bachand, in Outremont, and Emmanuel Dubourg, in Viau.
