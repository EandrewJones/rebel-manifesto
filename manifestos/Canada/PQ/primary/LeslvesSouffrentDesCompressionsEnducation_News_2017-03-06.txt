Québec- The spokesperson for the Parti Party in terms of education, research, school perseverance and literacy, Alexandre Cloutier, is sorry for the fact that the compressions in education, imposed since the beginning of the Liberal mandate, continue to do the victims. In 2015-16, the Ministry of Education identified 207,016 students with disabilities or in difficulty adaptation or learning (EHDAA) in public and private schools, compared to 191,747 in 2013-2014. 
"Departmental data are alarming. In 2 years, in Quebec, the number of students in difficulty has increased by 15,000; It's up more than 9%. But while the needs are increasing, the government continues to cut. Naturally, they are first students who suffer from it, "said Alexandre Cloutier. 
"Since the Liberals are in power, hundreds of positions of education professionals have been removed in our schools. These psychologists, psychoeductors, speech therapists, orthopedagogues, special education technicians - and I pass - for helping students in difficulty. What does the government intend to do? Certainly, in the last two years, rather than cutting, getting into a structural debate and playing the musical chair with the ministers of education, it would have better focused on the success of our students ", he added. 
Guaranteed threshold of direct services to students 
"More than ever, the Parti Québécois proposal to set up a guaranteed threshold of direct services to students attending Quebec schools becomes relevant. Services for students in difficulty should no longer make the costs of government budget decisions from one year to the next. The Ministry of Education establishes a minimum number of teachers per student; It should be the same for professionals who work with young people in difficulty, "concluded the spokesperson.
