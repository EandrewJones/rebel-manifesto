"Because the Minister of Health has taken a series of unilateral decisions regarding the world of pharmacy, many pharmacists can no longer welcome trainees. Unable to find an internship, some 70% of pharmacy students in Quebec could see their path jeward. We ask the Minister of Health to negotiate in good faith with pharmacists, "said Dave Turcotte. 
"The conflict that opposes the Minister of Health and the pharmacists is taking disproportionate proportions. Students are taken hostage. If the situation continues, more than 350 students will see their chaired curriculum next September. How much will the program leave? The minister responsible for higher education must defend students because they find themselves stuck in this conflict, "added Alexandre Cloutier.
