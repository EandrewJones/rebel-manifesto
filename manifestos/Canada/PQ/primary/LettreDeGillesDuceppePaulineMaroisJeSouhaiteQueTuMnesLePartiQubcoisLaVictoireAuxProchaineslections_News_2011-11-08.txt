"I thank you once again at the invitation that you made me to join the Parti Québécois. This invitation having taken a public turn, I feel obliged to raise any ambiguity. 
"As I told you privately, I do not exclude to join you and the Parti Québécois in the future, but I do not feel ready, right now, to plunge into active political life. 
"It does not mean, as some have affirmed, that I hold myself in" Reserve of the Republic ". I have no velléness to take the place of anyone. I do not endorse or encourage any challenge for your leadership. 
"On the contrary, as I said many times in private and in public, I want you to lead the Quebecois party to victory in the next election. 
"No one is better prepared than you. You have all the legitimacy, experience and determination to get there. In recent months, you have shown exceptional courage, a fundamental quality for those who aspires to lead Quebec and lead it to full political freedom. 
"Through this letter, I reiterate a message addressed to all sovereignists: let's work Pauline Marois and the Parti Québécois. Let's stop dividing. This is only that we will be able to convince Quebeckers to trust us. 
" In all friendship, 
"Gilles Duceppe 
"P.-S. - I would ask you to make this letter public by the usual means. »
