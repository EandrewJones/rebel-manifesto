Prime Minister of Ontario 
The Prime Minister, 
It is with regret that I learned your resignation as Prime Minister after several years at the service of Ontario. 
As Prime Minister of Ontario, you have always put forward the interests of your fellow citizens to which you leave a considerable legacy. I would like to greet the vigor with which you defended the place of French in public affairs. 
During your mandate, Ontario and Quebec have maintained sustainable links, in addition to maintaining a high level of cooperation in several sectors of activity. 
I wish to send you, on behalf of the Government of Quebec and in my name, best wishes for the future. 
I beg you to accept, Mr. Prime Minister, the expression of my best feelings. 
Original signed 
Pauline Marois »
