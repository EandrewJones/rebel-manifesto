Dear friends, 
At the beginning of the year 2020, let me go all my best health, joy and success in your projects. 
As you know, the activists gave me the mandate to chair the national executive council of the Parti Québécois. It is both an honor and a privilege to serve our political formation at this level, while it has just committed resolutely to deliver the independence of Quebec to the center of its political action. 
With our new statutes and our statement of principle, adopted last November, we have all the tools to continue our work in favor of an independent Quebec. But we will not fulfill this mandate alone. 
By becoming president of the Parti Québécois, I formally committed to working at the gathering of all independentists. This is why I enter, within a few days, a tour of all organizations favorable to independence; I want to exchange with them about the future of our nation and, above all, actions to undertake, together, to make Quebec an independent country. 
I am convinced that it is by the rally and the common actions that we can realize this project of society both pragmatic and ambitious. Quebec deserves this ultimate effort that will lead us, collectively, to the gates of our dream: to flourish a French-speaking, free and mistress nation of its destiny in America.
