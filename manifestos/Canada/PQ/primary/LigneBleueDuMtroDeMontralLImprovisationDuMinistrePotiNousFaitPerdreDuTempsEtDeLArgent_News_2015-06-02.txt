"In January, not to warn or consult anyone, Robert Poëti decided that the AM should study the option of a surface train for the extension of the blue line east of Montreal, even if a consensus existed so that The project takes the form of a traditional metro. Fi of expenses thus caused and the deadlines that his decision would entail, he changed the mandate of the project office, "said Martine Ouellet. 
However, the conclusion of the study, made public by the AMT, today, is unsurprisingly. "The surface mode could cause a decrease of 45% to 60% of the traffic generated by a conventional metro, and an increase to triple course time. It was obvious; Why did the minister ask the MT to look at the issue? We lost precious time, "continued the member. 
For his part, Jean-François Lisé think about the approximately 80,000 people who take this trip every day and waiting for the extension of the blue line of the metro for a long time already and impatiently. "The procrastination, the hesitation and improvisation of Robert Poëti did not advance the file, on the contrary. Now he has to go into action mode and commit to continuing the project in the form of a traditional metro; This is what citizens expect from him, "he concluded.
