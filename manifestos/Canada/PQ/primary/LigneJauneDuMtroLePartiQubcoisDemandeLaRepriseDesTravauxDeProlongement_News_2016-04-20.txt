Quebec- MEPs of the Quebec Party of Longueuil, Martine Ouellet (Vachon), Bernard Drainville (Marie-Victorin) and Diane Lamarre (Taillon), ask that the project of extension of the yellow line of the Montreal metro be taken over, in parallel Extension of the blue line. 
"It is deplorable that the project of extension of the yellow line of the Montreal metro is arrested and that no schedule is planned, despite all the analyzes and studies started in the past. This is a very important issue for the people of Longueuil and the South Shore, given all the congestion on the bridges, "said Martine Ouellet. 
"The citizens of Longueuil and the South Shore live immense stress; They are always afraid to arrive late at work, besides the hours they lose on bridges are hours they could go to their families. Increased GHG emissions and smooth GHG emissions should also be considered unnecessarily blocked cars. Unfortunately, until now, the Minister of Transport, Jacques Daoust, has only been able to demonstrate that he does not take the situation seriously, "added Bernard Drainville. 
"When the Quebecois Party formed the government, there were projects related to several metro lines. Can the minister send a clear signal that the yellow line will not be abandoned to the detriment of the blue line? Projects can very well be conducted parallel. The residents of the South Shore have been very patient. The extension of the metro yellow line is also synonymous with decreased GHGs, an important issue for all, "concluded Diane Lamarre.
