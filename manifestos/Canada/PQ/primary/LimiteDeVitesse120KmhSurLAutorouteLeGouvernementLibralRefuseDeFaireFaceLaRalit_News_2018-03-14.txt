Quebec, on March 14, 2018 - "Today, as part of the study of Bill 165, An Act to amend the Road Safety Code and other provisions, the Parti Québécois proposed to the Minister of Transport, André Fortin, to conduct a pilot project to set the speed limit at 120 km / h on the Québec highways. Unfortunately, the minister rejected the idea of the reverse of the hand, preferring to pursue with hypocrisy, "said Martin Ouellet, spokesperson for the official opposition in respect of transport, and André Villeneuve, deputy of Berthier. 
IN SHORT 
"It is public notoriety that it is possible to ride at 115 or even 120 km / h on the highway without being worried by the police, even if the official limit is fixed at 100. The Parti Québécois considers that it Is high time to end this hypocrisy, seriously study the possibility of setting the speed limit at 120 km / h on the highways of Quebec, and to enforce it, "said Martin Ouellet. 
"The goal is first of all of public security: the rules must be clear for everyone and applied uniformly. In other words, finished the sudden slowdowns for fear of crossing a police officer may be less tolerant! The pilot project should also include the possibility of decreasing the maximum speed when the weather conditions are difficult, as already expected by the Code of Road Safety, "explained André Villeneuve, who participates in the Parliamentary Committee on Bill 165. 
"Yesterday, the Minister of Transport and his team confessed that photo radars are not calibrated to give contraventions based on the current limit of 100 km / h. So, what is the speed truly tolerated by the police? It's a mystery. We have not managed to get an answer. It is completely absurd, and it demonstrates that the law must absolutely be adjusted to reality on the ground. We do not understand why the liberal government thus hides the head in the sand. A government of the Parti Québécois would end this hypocrisy, "concluded Martin Ouellet.
