Quebec- "I am very proud today to announce that our government strongly takes the turn of home care to allow all adults, both the seniors whose autonomy is diminished that people seeking autonomy, to have the freedom to choose where they want to receive the health care required by their condition. Autonomy insurance is to offer this choice to Quebecers. This is what the Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois said today, who made the Blanche Paragléautonomy for all, with the Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Seniors, Réjean Hébert. 
Quebec is the second state whose population is growing faster in the world after Japan. "Given the situation, more and more people see their autonomy decrease. In order to cope with the challenge that this reality imposes, it seems essential to rethink our care and service delivery model, and to turn to home care, which is exactly the autonomy insurance ", has for its share affirmed Minister Hébert. 
A parliamentary committee will look at the issue at the beginning of autumn. It will be an opportunity to discuss the solution tracks proposed in the White Paper to cope with the challenge of the aging of the population and to respond to the desire of seniors to be old at home. The government then intends to present a draft law on autonomy insurance, which it wishes to adopt before the end of the year.
