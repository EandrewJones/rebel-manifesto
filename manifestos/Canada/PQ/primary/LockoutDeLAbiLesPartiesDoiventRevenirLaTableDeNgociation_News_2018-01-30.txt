Quebec, January 30, 2018 - The Leader of the Official Opposition, Jean-François Lisée, and the Spokesman in Work, Guy Leclair, ask the union and employers' parties of the Bécancour (ABI) to come back at the bargaining table. In order to arrive at an agreement, the Liberal government must put everything on the table and also require the resumption of discussions. 
IN SHORT 
"Since the beginning of the lockout, two weeks ago, 1030 unionized employees find themselves unemployed and 80 workers from a subcontracting company have been dismissed. The ABI is the largest employer in the region. It is more than time than the minister comes out of his silence and gives the time just to the workers. What is the Liberal government to do to encourage both parties to return to the bargaining table? The minister must act! , "Said Guy Leclair. 
"The nature of the conflict forces the Liberal government to move but, once again, it is found at the trailer of the news. I intervene the minister to act quickly; The region should not be held hostage by this conflict. These are thousands of families who are affected. In addition, the company benefits from commercial agreements and preferential rates of Hydro-Québec. The public money of the taxpayers is at stake, which makes the resumption of negotiations all the more urgent, "added Jean-François Lisée. 
"Despite the media outings of Nicolet-Bécancour's MP, Donald Martel, we can see that the Future Québec Coalition is unable to make the voice of workers heard in this conflict. There is nothing surprising that this one persists; Mr. Martel has not yet deigned to meet the workers or the management of the company! ", Concluded the spokesperson for work.
