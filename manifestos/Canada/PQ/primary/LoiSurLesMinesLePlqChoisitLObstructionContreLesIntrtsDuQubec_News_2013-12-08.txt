They deliberately use subterfuges to mask reality: the PLQ is against the modernization of the rules that legislate the industry and does not want to know anything about transformation in Quebec. Nothing has changed from the Charest era. 
The Quebec government asked last Saturday that the Quebec National Assembly exceptionally sits on Monday, December 9, 2013 to make Bill 70 (An Act to amend the Mining Act) through a legislative procedure of exception.

The partial election of Philippe Couillard, tomorrow, is not a reason to disappoint Quebecers twice! He decided Mr. Bédard.

"Obviously, the only and last obstacle to a reform of the mining regime in Quebec is the PLQ," concluded the member for Chicoutimi
