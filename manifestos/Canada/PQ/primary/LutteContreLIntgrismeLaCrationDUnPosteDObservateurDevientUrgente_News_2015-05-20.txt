Quebec- As a result of the arrest, in Montreal, young people suspected of joining the ranks of the terrorist Islamic State organization, the member for Taschereau and spokesman for the official opposition on secularism, Agnès Maltese, Press the Minister of Justice to table, by the end of this parliamentary session, a bill to combat the phenomena of religious fundamentalism and radicalization. 
"The demonstration is made: whatever we think, even in Quebec, the phenomenon of religious fundamentalism is real, and we must tackle ourselves. The Minister of Justice had committed, more than a year ago, to quickly deposit a bill, but the deadline is constantly repulsed. Today, it has also remained strangely silent, refusing to answer the questions, which suggests that the filing of a legislation on secularism, religious neutrality and reasonable accommodations will be again postponed. In addition, if we take into account that it is the Minister of Public Safety that has risen to answer my questions, can we see the sign that the government intends to treat the issue from the perspective of the Coercion, instead of focusing on prevention? Asked Agnès Maltese. 
The hon. Member recalls that last February, the Québécois party filed Bill 395, the observer law of religious fundamentalism, proposing the creation of an observer position, intended to understand religious fundamentalism. , to document it and to prevent it. "Currently, worried parents have no choice but to contact the RCMP. It's foolish. They should be able to count on upstream resources. An observer of fundamentalism could, precisely, propose avenues of action and solution to equip families, "she concluded.
