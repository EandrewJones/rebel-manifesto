Quebec- The Deputy Officer of Terrebonne and official opposition to the fight against bullying, Mathieu Traversy, the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and spokesperson for primary and secondary education and perseverance School, Nicole Léger, as well as the member for Lac-Saint-Jean and Spokesperson for Justice, Alexandre Cloutier, denounce the inconsistency of the Liberal government, which holds a Grand Mass to tackle intimidation and Violence in schools, while at the same time, it suggests institutions to cut into the envelope provided for this purpose. 
Remember that, in the summer, the Office of the Minister of Education, Yves Bolduc, awarded school boards a list comprising 32 suggestions for possible cuts in direct services to students. Unfortunately, we see this morning that some school boards will follow the advice of the Minister's Office and cut in budgets devoted to the prevention and combat intimidation and violence in schools. 
"How did the Liberal government suggest cutting in budgets dedicated to the fight against intimidation in schools, whereas it is supposed to be a priority for the Prime Minister and the Minister of Family? At this very moment, they both participate in a forum on this theme; Where is the consistency? Asked MPHieu Traversy. 
Nicole Léger has emphasized the responsibility of Minister Yves Bolduc. "How much has we cut into the fight against intimidation in Quebec schools? The Minister of Education is responsible for this sad situation, and it is his duty to quantify the extent of the damage. Quebeckers have the right to know, "said the member. 
"Do these compressions will affect the application of the 2011-2016 Government Homophobia Agriculture Plan in Quebec Schools? The situation is worrying. The Minister of Justice can not stay the arms crossed; It must intervene with its colleague Minister of Education, "said Alexander Cloutier.
