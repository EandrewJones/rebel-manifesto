Quebec- The evidence is now done and unequivocally: the government is likely to designate the person who will investigate the Liberal Party. This is the only conclusion that can happen, considers the spokesman of the Parti Québécois in terms of public safety, Pascal Bérubé. Indeed, the government rejected the motion that it has presented today in the House on this subject. 
"We know that the Liberal Party is currently under UPAC's investigation. However, the mandate of the UPAC Head Commissioner, whose mission is to coordinate the actions of prevention and control of contractual corruption in the public sector, has expired, and the Commissioner asks the political party on which he investigates to renew him in his duties. It's foolish, it does not inspire at all confidence, and it is absolutely necessary that it changes! He insisted the spokesperson. 
The Parti Québécois believes that the post of the fight against corruption must be occupied by a person who has obtained the two-thirds of elected officials sitting in the National Assembly. "This is how in Quebec, the Auditor General is appointed and the Chief Electoral Officer. I do not see how neither why we could take less precautions to appoint a person as important as the Commissioner for the fight against corruption, "pursued Pascal Bérubé. 
The motion rejected by Liberal MPs reads as follows: 
"That the National Assembly requests the Government that the appointment of the Commissioner to Fight Corruption is approved by two-thirds of its members. »
