Quebec - "The adoption of a law in 2002 by the Quebecois party to combat poverty and social exclusion has since forced the government to adjust its programs. Nevertheless, the work is far from completed: still too many people live in misery and some decisions taken in recent years have been catastrophic, including increases in major tariffs. It's time to take stock. 
This is what the member for Saint-Jean and spokesman of the official opposition in employment, social solidarity and poverty struggle, Dave Turcotte, reiterated the request made by the Quebecois party on June 14, for the holding of a parliamentary committee. 
This request is supported by many organizations as well as by the collective for a Quebec without poverty. The objective is to do the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Poverty Reduction and Social Exclusion on Income Targets transmitted to the Government in 2009. 
"It is necessary today that parliamentarians hear the independent experts who have participated in the drafting of this opinion and the organizations that act directly with the poorest to verify whether the government response coming in June 2011 is up. It is our duty, as elected, to ensure that not only the law, but also the spirit of the law adopted in 2002 are respected. We therefore hope that the Liberal government finally responds to this request for a parliamentary commission formulated last June and which is the subject of a very broad consensus in Quebec, "concluded Dave Turcotte.
