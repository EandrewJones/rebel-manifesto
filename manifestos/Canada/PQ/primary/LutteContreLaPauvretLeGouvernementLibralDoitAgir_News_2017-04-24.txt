Quebec, April 24, 2017- Harold Lebel, spokesman for the Employment, Social Solidarity and Poverty Fighting Party, asks the Liberal government to stop dragging their feet. "The fight against poverty requires immediate investments," he insisted. 
IN SHORT 
"Liberal austerity hurts a large number of sectors in Quebec, and the fight against poverty is among the hardest hit. It has been shown several times that the cuts had had a real impact on the services to the population, contrary to the promises and affirmations of the Prime Minister. It is an issue that does not seem to be concerned about his government; As evidence, the sums provided for this purpose in its latest budget, significantly insufficient. Or, Quebec must defend the poorest, it can not give up, "continued Harold Lebel. 
He mentions two major records related to the fight against poverty in which the Minister of Social Solidarity, François Blais, drags particularly his feet. "First, we still do not know the details of the welfare reform. After adopting it forced this fall, in a widespread opposition, the Liberals leave the publication of the regulations dragged. It's a height! The government must immediately reveal the details of the modifications. In addition, we have been waiting for too long the filing of the Plan to Fight Poverty and Social Exclusion. François Blais must act and quickly introduce his strategy, "he concluded.
