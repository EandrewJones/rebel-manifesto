The member for Taschereau and spokesman for the Partié Québécois in secularism, Agnès Maltais, as well as the member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesperson in education, Alexandre Cloutier, denounce the fact that the Federation of CEGEPs Has been excluded from the international conference on future radicalization, while the government claims to actively fight against this scourge. 
"The Center for the Prevention of Radicalization leading to violence has just published an expanded report showing that the school environment in general, and the college of Maisonneuve in particular, is a fertile ground for radicalization. As proof, no less than thirty young Quebeckers, including several students from Maisonneuve College, have been indoctrinated in order to attach Jihad to Syria. And the government does not even invite CEGEPs at a conference that aims to counter radicalization? It's insane, "said Agnès Maltais. 
"It's an alarm cry that the CEGEP Federation has launched the government this morning. People, on the ground, feel the need to manifest publicly to highlight the Liberal government's lax when it comes to preventing radicalization in the education community. The government must correct the shot. Quebec must, like all Western countries, make everything implemented to curb the radicalization of its young, "added Alexandre Cloutier. 
"The school environment is the place par excellence to teach secularism, an aspect of social life that characterizes Quebec since the Quiet Revolution. Secularism is a valuable value, which is learned, and the actors of the education network are certainly among the best placed to raise awareness and interest our youth about the issue. They certainly part of the solution in the fight against radicalization and religious fundamentalism, and must absolutely be invited to the collective reflection to be held on the subject, "concluded the hon. Member for Taschereau.
