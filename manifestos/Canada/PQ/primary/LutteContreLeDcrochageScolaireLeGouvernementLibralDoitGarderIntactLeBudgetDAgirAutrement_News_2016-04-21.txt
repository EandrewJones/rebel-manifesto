The member of Pointe-aux-Trembles, Nicole Léger, arrested him this morning on this subject during the question period.

How can the government, on one side, say that it wants to fight against stall, while on the other hand it cut into the main program of academic perseverance? He must restore the amounts of acting otherwise, "Nicole Léger said. 
This program, created by the Government of the Parti Québécois, is specifically addressed to young people most likely to win, in the most disadvantaged circles.
