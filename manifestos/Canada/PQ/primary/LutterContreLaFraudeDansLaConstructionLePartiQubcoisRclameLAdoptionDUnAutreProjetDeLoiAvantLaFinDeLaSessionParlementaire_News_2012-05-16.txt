Quebec- The member for Gouin and official opposition on transport, Nicolas Girard, is surprised that, despite the adoption of two laws (law 73 in 2009 and law 35 in 2011), Companies related to the construction community, whose leaders argue guilty according to criminal laws, still obtain lucrative contracts of the Quebec state. 
Last week, pressed questions by the Quebecois Party in the National Assembly, two ministers of the Charest government, the Ministers of Labor and Transport, Lise Thériault and Pierre Moreau, were in turn indicated that the law could actually have to be reviewed given the existence of a breach. This week, the government adopts a new speech and argues that everything is perfect. 
"Despite the demonstration made and despite the confession of two ministers last week, we are told today that we will leave that even. It's a nonsense! The Liberal government no longer wants to block the road to fraudsters. Why? What happened at the end of the week for the government to change its mind? The Charest government received the phone from whom to make such a spectacular turn? ", Questions the member Nicolas Girard. 
For the Parti Québécois, the law must absolutely be amended before the adjournment of parliamentary work next June. It offers its collaboration. "Through corporate sails, we bypass the law. The government knows it and does not want to do anything. We have four weeks left to clog the law. Minister Thériault must introduce another bill to prevent fraudsters from getting millions of dollars from department of transport contracts. If it does not do it, we will have to conclude that the government seeks to protect from the world, "concluded Nicolas Girard
