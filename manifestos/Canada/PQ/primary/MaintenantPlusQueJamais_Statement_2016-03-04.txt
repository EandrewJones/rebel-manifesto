Our invited blogger, Annick Vigeant, gives us his impressions as part of our National Council of February 27th and 28th, 2016 in Trois-Rivières. 
A national council is always a good opportunity to measure the mood of the troops and evaluate the state of a political party. Where are we ? Where are we going ? 
Our late week Council last week in Trois-Rivières has resolutely demonstrated that hope and optimism were at the rendezvous. It shone in the eyes of activists! 
The media have of course noted the collective good mood, but it went beyond that: it is an atmosphere of great collaboration and mutual trust between the high instances and the activists who reigned, cohesion in the action, of Shared belief that the Parti Québécois was on the right track. 
Many have noted a great diversity within delegates and observers. A large number of young sovereignists was present: 
"There is a cohesion, coherence in action. We really feel a momentum. It emanates, that, and it gives the taste to participate. That's why I'm here at the end of the week. We feel that something happens " 
-Julien Levac Joubert 
The work of the new party director, Alain Lupien, acclaimed several times during the event, no stranger. And the clarity of the message of our chef, Pierre Karl Péladeau, nor are we going to the country and we will work with everyone who has the same goal as us to get there. 
Proportional vote, convergence of the independence movement, everything is done to open and democratize the movement, to ensure that every citizen who believes in the possibility of making Quebec a country can find his place and give his hand so that 'We arrive there, together. 
We are on the way to the 2017 Congress and the 2018 elections. We have the tools, we have the plan, we have the activists and we have each of you who have thought one day or the other it was possible. 
This is. Now more than ever.
