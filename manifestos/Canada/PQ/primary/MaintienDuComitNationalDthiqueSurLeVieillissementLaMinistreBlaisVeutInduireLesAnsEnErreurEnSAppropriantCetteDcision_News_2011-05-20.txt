Quebec - Member for Crémazie and spokesperson for the official opposition in terms of seniors, Lapointe Lisette, strongly regrets the attitude of the Minister of Elders, Marguerite Blais, who suggests that it is thanks to her if the National Committee on Ethics on aging will be maintained. 
In front of the government's obstinate refusal to maintain the Elders Council, the member for Crémazie proposed to the President of the Treasury Board, Michelle Courchesne, the maintenance of the National Committee on Ethics on aging. This committee is formed of exceptional personalities, all volunteers. Minister Courchesne welcomed this proposal and amendment to maintaining the National Committee on Ethics on aging was adopted yesterday morning in parliamentary committee. 
"It's been weeks that we emphasize, supported by the great seniors' associations in Quebec, in favor of the survival of the Elders Council. Throughout this time, the Minister Blais did not intervene and wanted to hear this vibrant plea. The Minister Blais should have a bit of honor and recognize that the decision to maintain, at a minimum, the National Committee on Ethics on Aging is not the result of his work, "said Lapointe Lisette. 
In addition, the member for Crémazie wanted to thank all the people, employees and volunteers, who, in recent years, have devoted themselves and put their expertise and talent for the service of Quebec Société for the well-being of seniors. .
