Quebec- The member of Pointe-Aux-Trembles and sentence of the official opposition in terms of primary and secondary education and school perseverance, Nicole Léger, is disappointed by the Prime Minister, who said today. He did not intend to replace Yves Bolduc at the head of the Ministry of Education, Leisure and Sport. 
"The Prime Minister speaks of a 2020-2025 vision of the school; This year, he obviously decided to put the ax in the services to the students. When we intend to boast the work of his minister of education, he has the impression that he is in a parallel universe. If there is one thing that is unanimously unanimous in the world of education is that the minister is not up to height. In fact, there is only one person in Quebec who has not yet understood that Bolduc exists is not in his place: Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, "said Nicole Léger. 
The Minister Yves Bolduc added yesterday, mentioning that the rise in the master-student ratio would not have an impact, a statement against what the whole of the education community supports; Numerous studies that have looked at this ratio have demonstrated that the number of students per class is a determining factor in the academic success of all children, including students in difficulty. 
"This exit from Yves Bolduc, to justify the rise in the ratio, is the last act of a tragicomedy that has only one character: the Minister of Education himself. This bad play has lasted enough. For the good of the children of Quebec and the entire education community, Yves Bolduc must leave, "concluded Nicole Léger.
