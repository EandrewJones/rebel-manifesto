Québec -It Morning at the National Assembly, the member for Taschereau and spokesman for the official health opposition, Agnès Maltese, has filed a petition signed by 7331 Quebecers asking for better access to different birthplaces, including Birth homes. 
"While several future mothers do not have access to adequate pregnancy monitoring, the Minister of Health and Social Services, Yves Bolduc, is slow to accelerate the development of birth homes and midwives in Quebec. Yet, needs are urgent and midwives are available. The minister has a duty to act now, "said the member for Taschereau. 
"Since the deposit of the perinatal policy, the development of birth homes is slow. Three years ago, the Charest government undertook that 10% of deliveries in Quebec are made by midwives, over a period of ten years. But now, it's just 2%. Since the deposit of the perinatal policy, only two new birth homes have emerged, which is totally insufficient, "said Agnès Maltese. 
The Ministry of Health and Social Services refused to finance the projects of new birth homes at 100%, which had the effect of slowing development. Moreover, on April 13, the member for Taschereau asked the Minister a modification of the method of financing. This morning, in response to a question from the Leader of the Official Opposition, the Minister of Health visited the opposition's arguments by announcing 100% funding for new birth homes. 
"We welcome the commitment of the Minister of Health to finance 100% the new birth homes projects. I only want the minister will really realize his promise. We have freshly remembered an announcement of the minister regarding free, in hospitals, lucentis injections, a drug to combat wet macular degeneration. However, the free free by the minister in this file is always waiting. Let us hope that the financing of birth homes will not suffer the same fate, "Agnès Maltais concluded.
