Boucherville - Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, Announces $ 99,300 Financial Assistance for the Restoration of the Quintal House in Boucherville, Ranked Heritage Building Under the Cultural Heritage Act . 
"The heritage property deserve special attention, and the Government of Quebec recognizes the importance of seeing their safeguard. I am grateful to the current owners of the Quintal House, a home of exceptional heritage value, for their commitment to the conservation of this place. Its sustainability can thus be ensured for the benefit of the people of the region, but also of all those interested in the architecture and history of Quebec, "says Minister Kotto. 
The Quintal House has been protected since 1976. It benefits from a protective area and is part of the Cité du Vieux-Boucherville heritage site. This old farmhouse of the French regime was built between 1727 and 1750, and modified in 1887 in the Victorian eclectic spirit. In many ways, it is similar to the colonial homes of southern cotton plantations. 
The restoration project, estimated at about $ 250,000, is essentially aimed at the foundations of the house. The contribution of nearly $ 100,000 from the Ministry of Culture and Communications is part of the Québec Cultural Heritage Fund. The owners of the house complete funding.
