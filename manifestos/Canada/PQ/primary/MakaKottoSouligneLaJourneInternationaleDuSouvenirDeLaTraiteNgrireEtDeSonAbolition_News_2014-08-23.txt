Montreal- The member for Bourget and the official opposition for the immigration and head of the French Language Charter, Maka Kotto, points out the International Day of Remembrance of the Negotary Trafficking and His Abolition and invites the Quebecers and Quebeckers to remember this dark chapter in our history. 
It is also good to remember that for nearly 50 years, the League des Blacks du Qu√©bec works, through its actions to raise awareness, to the commemoration of this international day, which takes an essential place in this duty of memory. The slave trade, which lasted from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth century and which caused the deportation and sale of more than 25 million women, men and children, is one of the largest tragedies of humanity in that which relates to scale and duration. 
"Generations later, the level of resonance is still high, and the memory of this episode of recent humanity has remained vivid throughout the African continent and around the world. These centuries of uprooting still have, in several African countries, consequences for their development and their future, "said Maka Kotto. 
"Obfund often opens the doors of a perpetual recommence. Injustice, atrocities, crimes against humanity and racism, among others, are evils that still afflict our planet. As the regretted Nelson Mandela said, education is the most powerful weapon that can be used to change the world. Let's enjoy this day of August 23 to measure all the possibilities, "concluded the member. 
Remember that Thursday, August 21, Mr. Kotto took the floor on the occasion of a reception at the Montreal City Hall to highlight the International Day of the Remembrance of the Negotary Trafficking and its Abolition. The event was organized by the Black League, which works to promote values of respect for human rights, thanks in particular to the courage and determination of its founder, Mr. Dan Philip.
