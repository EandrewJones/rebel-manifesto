Quebec- The member for Berthier and official opposition spokesman in agriculture, André Villeneuve, is sorry that Minister Pierre Paradis does not go to the meeting of the agricultural succession of Quebec. The Minister has in fact entrusted this mandate to the former President of the Commission on the Future of Quebec Agriculture and Agribusiness, Jean Pronovost. However, by refusing to take care of this personally stake, he relies on his responsibilities. 
"The minister refuses to do the job. Having met many agricultural representatives in the last year, I found that Pierre Paradis carefully avoids doing the same. The mandate entrusted to Jean Pronovost is not an expanded consultation or a commission of inquiry; He is only asked to listen to what the succession has to say. What prevents the minister from meeting these people himself? André Villeneuve wondered. 
Remember that the numbers' control bill, adopted last December, had to stop service contracts. Unfortunately, the cases are increasing: let us think only of the contracts granted to André Dicaire at the Ministry of the Executive Board, or François Garneau, who must find where to make cuts at the Ministry of Culture and Communications. In addition, today's announcement: Pierre Paradis will appeal to Jean Pronovost to do his job as a minister in his place. "While the minister will stay in his office, how much will be the mandate to Jean Pronovost? ", Concluded André Villeneuve.
