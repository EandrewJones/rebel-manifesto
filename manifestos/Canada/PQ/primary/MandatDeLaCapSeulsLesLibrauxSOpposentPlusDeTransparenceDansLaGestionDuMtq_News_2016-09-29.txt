Quebec- Martine Ouellet, Member of Parliament for Vachon and spokesperson for the Quebec of Transport, deplores the Government's refusal to respond to the mandate of the Public Administration Commission (CAP) to follow up on the actions taken by the minister to clean up governance at the Ministry of Transport (MTQ).

"If the government refuses to track the gestures it has made to clean up the management of the MTQ, it is simply because nothing has been done since 2014. However, the stake is important! The MTQ is the largest client in Quebec; Bad management is therefore losing hundreds of millions of dollars to Quebecers. I would also add that if Minister Lessard believes that there are no ethical issues around him, he really lives on another planet, "prosecuted the spokesman. 
Remember that Recommendation 8.2 of the Capital Report - adopted unanimously by the members of the Commission, therefore by some Liberal MPs - suggested that a commission be mandated to monitor the actions put in place to improve the governance of the MTQ. "The Government refused the deposit of our motion asking the National Assembly to mandate the Committee on Transport and the Environment in this respect; It means everything, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
