Quebec- The Quebec Party spokesperson in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, was present this morning to support the dairy farmers who left, in tractor, to Ottawa to manifest against imports of milk diafiltrtered. Accompanied by his colleagues François GENDRON, Agnès Maltais and Harold Lebel, he launched a strong message for producers. 
"The federal minister is aware of the problem and knows the solutions, but he refuses to implement them. The National Assembly spoke unanimously in support of producers, and I will be present in Ottawa on Thursday to express this support. I invite the Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, to join me in order to send a strong message to the federal government. I also invite the CAQ and Quebec Solidarity to be present, on the ground, with producers, "said André Villeneuve. 
Imports of diafiltered milk, contrary to the spirit of federal regulation, are harmful to our farmers, who suffer a disloyal competition. "Diafiltrated milk from the United States causes losses for Quebec farms of a hundred million dollars annually. For a dairy farm, it can be a shortfall of more than $ 20,000 a year. These are human dramas that emerge on the horizon, if we do nothing. The federal government only has to apply its regulations consistently, and the problem will be resolved, "concluded André Villeneuve.
