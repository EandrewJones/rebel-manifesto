The Leader of the Official Opposition, Jean-François Lisée, Vice-Cheffe and Spokesperson for Family and Justice, Véronique Hivon, and the sentence on finance, Nicolas Marceau, presented today The Québécois party proposal to foster competition in the Quebec economy, so that consumers benefit from lower prices and increased purchasing power: the creation of the Quebec Consumer Protection Office. 
IN SHORT 
"For twenty years, in Canada, it can be observed evidence that markets are less competitive, more concentrated. Result: Goods and services are more expensive and businesses are gaining abnormally high profits. In short, Quebec consumers are having: while many hardly curl their ends of months, they pay too much what they consume, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
This is why the Parti Québécois is committed to creating the Consumer Protection Office of Quebec. "In Canada, the Competition Bureau is responsible for maintaining healthy competition and combating corporate corporal practices, but it hurts it; It is soft, lack of rigor, it is ineffective. In Quebec, we have the Office for Consumer Protection, but its mandate does not cover anti-competitive practices or abuse of dominant position, "continued Jean-François Lisée. 
"With the Consumer Protection Office of Quebec, there will be real investigations and real consequences for companies that abuse Quebecers and Quebeckers. Thus, there will be more competition in our economy, prices will be lower, the purchasing power of consumers will be increased. In short, our entire economy will benefit, "concluded Nicolas Marceau.
