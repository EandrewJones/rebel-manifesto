Quebec- The hon. Member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and sentence of the official opposition in terms of women, Carole Poirier, as well as the member for Taschereau and spokesperson in secularism, Agnès Maltese, denounce the attitude of the attitude of Liberal deputy of Lafontaine, Marc Tanguay, who invited the population "to be open" after being informed that a community center he had agreed to financially sponsor, through an advertising , hosts writings on his website advocating the submission of women and violence against them. Although he has withdrawn his advertising, after having been summoned by his Prime Minister, Marc Tanguay still has to apologize for thus trivializing violence against women. 
"When it comes to violence, there is no" openness ", no possible compromises; Any appeal to violence must be condemned. Marc Tanguay must apologize for quotation advocating the domination of man as well as physical and psychological violence against women. How can this Liberal member ask for "shades" when it comes to the physical and mental integrity of women? ", Asked Carole Poirier. 
"Since the ruling of the Liberal Party, we are witnessing an incredible series of flip-flop in secularism and fundamentalism files. Let's think of Minister Weil who was willing to hire a fundamentalist within his cabinet, or to the Prime Minister who continues to play on words while constantly pushing the filing of a bill. Marc Tanguay is not at his first false not unacceptable, he who had said last year that he would have no problem than a candidate of the PLQ bears Chador. The Government must retain our suggestion and create an observer position of religious fundamentalism in order to document the phenomenon and, thus, to prevent violent remarks on the web, bonded by elected officials, "concluded Agnès Maltese .
