Québec- The member for Vachon and sentence of the official opposition on transport, electrification of transport and maritime strategy, Martine Ouellet, filed a brief to the public hearings of the Quebec Transport Commission (CTQ) on the requests of Orléans Express, who wishes to modify his interurban transport services by bus. 
In the memorandum deposited by Martine Ouellet, the members of the Parti Québécois call on the CTQ to form a working committee to bring together the various private and public intercity stakeholders in Quebec. 
"We could thus think about new solutions that can guarantee the maintenance of the bus service, already precarious in several regions, and the profitability of transport companies. By the Committee filed its report, Orleans Express must maintain its services to avoid a decrease in the public transport supply, particularly in the regions for which the bus remains the latest affordable means of transport ", has declared the member. 
The decrease and disappearance of the applicant's proposed services would generate several direct consequences, such as a reduction in the mobility of seniors and accessibility to the Rimouski Hospital, a limitation of the parcel delivery service, the loss of Forty jobs, a decrease in mobility to the cities of the Tuque, Thetford Mines and Louiseville, and could even threaten tourism development in Gaspésie. In addition, this reduction in service would still affect students and seniors, particularly low-income those. 
"Considering the importance of the modifications requested by Orleans Express, the CTQ must mandate a working committee that will reflect on solutions better adapted to the new realities of collective transport in the region. The mere reduction of the service is not possible, "said Martine Ouellet.
