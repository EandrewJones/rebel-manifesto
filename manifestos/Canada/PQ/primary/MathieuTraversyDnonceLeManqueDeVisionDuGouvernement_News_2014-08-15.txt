Quebec, August 15, 2014 -The MP for Terrebonne and official opposition on the family, Mathieu Traversy, deplores the postponement of the creation of thousands of care services, yet greatly expected by families. It, in his view, demonstrates the lack of vision of the Liberal Party with respect to the economy and support for Quebec families. 
"The Minister of the Family, Francine Charbonneau, does not seem to realize that child care is an investment and not an expense, and that postpone the award of places hurts families from all regions. This decision will have significant impacts on work-family reconciliation for thousands of Quebecers. The lack of vision of the Liberal Party a lot about the Quebec economy, and it's again the families who are the costs, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
A meaning of the deputy priorities also denounces the words of the minister, reported in the media this morning, to the effect that the previous government had not budgeted the places it had announced. Mathieu Traversy recalls that on the contrary, in both budgets filed by the former Minister of Finance, Nicolas Marceau, the Government of Pauline Marois had planned and registered the creation of 28,000 places. 
"The government of the Parti Québécois had made the creation of these places a priority. Minister Charbonneau has only to blame if it can not make the premier's right to make it a priority for his government. Once again, the liberal decisions prove to us that the only party that has a vision for the economy and who defends our families, it is the Parti Québécois, "concluded the speech.
