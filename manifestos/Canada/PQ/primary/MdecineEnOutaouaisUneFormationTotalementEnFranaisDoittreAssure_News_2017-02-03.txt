"In Quebec, it's non-negotiable: the common and official language is French. We ask the government to be firm, to ensure that the law of students and students from the Outaouais to receive entire training in French or respected, "said the official opposition. 
"The arrival of a Faculty of Medicine in Outaouais must be an opportunity for the region and its population to see health disparities decrease. We need to fight against the exodus of professionals and patients to Ontario, and not contribute directly or indirectly! Since the beginning of the courses is expected only in 2020, McGill University has enough time to adapt; She also has all the resources needed to provide a 100% French teaching, and this, in the first year, "Rengine Stéphane Bergeron. 
In order to support McGill, the Parti Québécois proposes to associate the University of Quebec in Outaouais (UQO) at the approach. "This would make it possible to develop in the region expertise and, possibly, related training, in addition to providing students with a favorable environment for their apprenticeship," continued the member for Verchères. 
"It would be cruelly ironic, or even perfectly unacceptable, that Students of the Outaouais can follow medical training in French in Ottawa, but not in Gatineau. The government must make a firm commitment in this regard, and confirm that it will promote the collaboration of the UQO, "concluded Jean François Lisée.
