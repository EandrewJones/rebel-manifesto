Quebec- The member for Berthier and spokesman of the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, urges the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Paradis, to immediately restore the mention "Quebec product". 
"Fortunately, thanks to the citizens, the producers and the Parti Québécois - who have denounced without waiting for the decision - Minister Paradis has recognized his mistake and will restore the mandatory labeling of Quebec's products. That said, it is essential that the mention returns to the faster, so that consumers can get reliable information about the origin of their fruits and vegetables, "said André Villeneuve. 
Minister Pierre Paradis presents the disappearance of the mention "Quebec's product" as an unfortunate "consequence" of the repeal of a regulation. However, the earth magazinela from us revealed that the impact assessment produced by the department mentioned the withdrawal of this obligation. 
"The Minister Paradis was aware that he was withdrawing the mention" Quebec's product "by repealing the regulation, or he did not read the impact assessment. If so, should it be concluded that it does not become aware of its records before signing the decrees? It remains that one way or another is very disturbing, "added the member for Berthier. 
"Pierre Paradis has agreed to reduce mandatory labeling only after the popular outcry. By removing the mention "Quebec's product", it has shown unacceptable lack of consideration for Quebec producers. Can we still trust him, while he is about to launch a summit on food? ", Concluded the member.
