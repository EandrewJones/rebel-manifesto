Québec- reacting to the withdrawal of the obligation to display the mention "Quebec product" on the fruits and vegetables from Quebec, the member for Berthier and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, wonders for who works the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Paradis. 
"Not only Pierre Paradis does not support Quebec producers but, in addition, he works against them. The "Quebec product" indication is an indispensable tool for putting our foods forward. Remove it, it's downright going to be missed the promotion of local purchase! More and more, consumers want to buy fresh Quebec products; Why give them less information? There is no valid reason justifying the withdrawal of this obligation. Minister Paradis, instead of promoting Quebec's fruits and vegetables, should introduce measures to highlight them, "said André Villeneuve. 
It should be remembered that the Liberal Party has put an end to the food sovereignty policy that the Quebecois Government has launched in 2013. "We see here a new illustration than for the government, the local purchase and Support for Quebec farmers are not priorities. The Liberal Party goes in the wrong direction. It is essential to restore the policy of food sovereignty and the obligation to display "Quebec product" on the fruits and vegetables of here ", has concluded the member.
