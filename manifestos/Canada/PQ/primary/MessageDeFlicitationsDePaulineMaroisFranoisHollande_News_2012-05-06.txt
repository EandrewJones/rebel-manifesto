Quebec - Here is the message of the official opposition leader and MP from Charlevoix, Pauline Marois, François Hollande, elected President of the French Republic: 
"Mr. President elected, 
Tonight, the French people have chosen you to preside over his future for the next five years. 
I want to express my warmest congratulations and through me, those of the Parti Québécois. 
Your beautiful victory is the fruit of a brilliant campaign that you have conducted in recent months and have followed with special attention. You have gathered a majority of French around an ambitious and inspiring project. 
The message expressed tonight by the French people will be heard, I am sure, far beyond your borders. The strength of your proposals and the vision that you expressed during the election campaign give hope and new perspectives to meet the immense challenges facing France and Europe. 
Quebec and France have long have a privileged relationship with the particular links in our history and also because we share common values. I am confident that this relationship, always placed under the sign of friendship, will be further strengthened in the coming years. Rest assured that you can count on my political training and my support. 
Please accept, Mr. President elected, the expression of my very high consideration. »
