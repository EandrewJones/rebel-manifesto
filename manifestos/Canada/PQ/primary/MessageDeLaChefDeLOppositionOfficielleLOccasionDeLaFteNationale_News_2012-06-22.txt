Québec - Here is the message that the leader of the official opposition and hon. Member for Charlevoix, Pauline Marois, addresses all Quebeckers and to all Quebeckers on the occasion of the National Day: 
"In recent months, Quebec has experienced exceptional events that have jostled us, which have sometimes been difficult. I think the time has come to gather around what we have more valuable. This boils down in a four-letter word: we. We wear it as an extent. He takes his roots on the borders of our history. From the solidarity of the great crossings that have led our ancestors on our shores, to the organized chores to rebuild the barn fire of the neighbor. It is a tense hand because our crossing is not over and that remains room on this vessel. Cenoust bearer of solidarity. Cenousst bearer of hope. Cenusit that we are stronger together. Cenous is the basis of what we are and especially what we will be in the future.The Quebec in us is the theme of the National Day this year. We must take advantage of it to gather peacefully, happily, in the Quebec way. That's what I invite us to do throughout the summer. A Quebec summer that will allow us to gather around our pride. For our national holiday, I invite you to go out, walk, to display our colors and flag. This year, more than ever, let's gather. Let's show our pride! Happy National day! »
