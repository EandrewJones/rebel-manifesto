Quebec- The Minister of the Family, Ms. Nicole Léger, today launches a new call for projects under the Municipal Family Policy Support Program. This program is for municipalities and regional county municipalities (MRCs) who want to adapt their services to the reality of families in their territory and thus better meet their needs. 
"A municipal family policy is a project that ensures that the needs of families are taken into account in all orientations that may affect them. Municipalities become more attractive to families, and the entire winning community through services that are better adapted to the needs of the population, "said Minister Nicole Léger. 
The implementation of a family policy promotes the consideration of the needs of families in all areas of intervention, whether it is security, transport, housing or culture and culture and Hobbies. In 2014-2015, an envelope of $ 885,000 is available for municipalities and MRCs wishing to take advantage of this program. 
In Quebec, to date, 703 municipalities and 27 MRCs have such a policy or are in the process of doing so, so that 86% of the Quebec population lives in a municipality in this program. 
Information documents and application forms under the Municipal Family Policies Financial Support Program are available on the Ministry of Family website, atwww.mfa.gouv.qc.ca. The project call ends on April 17, 2014.
