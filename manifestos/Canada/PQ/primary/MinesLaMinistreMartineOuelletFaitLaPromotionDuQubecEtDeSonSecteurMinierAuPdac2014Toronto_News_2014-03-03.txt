Toronto-the Minister of Natural Resources of Quebec, Mrs. Martine Ouellet, was in Toronto on 2 and 3 March as part of the Annual Conference of the Prospectors Association and Entrepreneurs of Canada (PDAC). She took this opportunity to highlight the importance of mining activity for the Government of Quebec. 
"Representing nearly 45,000 jobs, the mining sector is a pillar of Quebec's economic development. Our government has made concrete and structuring gestures to support the completion of carrier mining projects. In addition to creating a stable, clear and profitable investment context, we want to be an example of responsible mining development. The adoption of the Mining Act, in December 2013, is a good example, "said Martine Ouellet. 
The Minister of Natural Resources has been involved with more than 300 people of the importance of mining for the Government of Quebec as part of a meeting for the actors of the mining industry interested in Quebec on the sidelines of the PDAC in Toronto. It will also make a speech as part of a PDAC information session on the modernization of the legislative framework for mining development, business opportunities and topical projects in Quebec.

It brings together about 1,300 exhibitors, including 60 government exhibitors. Quebec is good at its flag. Each year, more than 10,000 visitors visit the Ministry of Natural Resources specialists who promote the mineral potential of Quebec as well as the conditions for completion of mining activities. 
"Quebec is internationally recognized for its expertise, the quality of its workforce and knowledge of the territory with an extraordinary database accessible to all. The PDAC Congress is a great opportunity to publicize Quebec, its mineral potential and its business potential, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
