Quebec- The member for Rousseau and the official opposition for the finance, Nicolas Marceau, regrets that the management of the Liberal government isolated Quebec by slowing down the economy and creating a climate of harmful uncertainty for the Employment and regional development, while the federal government continues to grow surplus. 
"We are in two completely different worlds. On the one hand, there is the situation in which the Liberal government has placed: decline in growth in Quebec, lower jobs, important cuts, new round taxes and taxes. Meanwhile, in Ottawa, there is an increase in growth, the number of jobs, as well as budget surpluses despite tax cuts, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
Between March and today, 17 billion surplus were added to the federal forecasts, while the Stephen Harper government is preparing to cut $ 10 billion in federal transfers to Quebec for health. "The Minister of Finance should not believe his eyes, who was nearing the existence of the fiscal imbalance. Rather than thinking about further increasing taxes and tariffs, it should require the cancellation of Ottawa's health cuts, the federal level swimming in the surpluses, "continued the member for Rousseau. 
Nicolas Marceau also points out that while he has lost 82,000 full-time jobs in Quebec, he added 131,000 in the rest of Canada. "The Liberal government of Philippe Couillard beat a 23-year-old mediocrity record for job losses, recorded by his party. The liberal effect ultimately means that the dismantling of regional development tools and record losses. When he claims that there will be no employment recovery plan, the Minister of Finance is scrapped by his Prime Minister. But what the economic update shows us today is that the Liberal government has to recover and rapidly deposits an economic development plan, "he concluded.
