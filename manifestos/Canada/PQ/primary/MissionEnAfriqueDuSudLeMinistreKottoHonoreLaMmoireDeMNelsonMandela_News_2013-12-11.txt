"Now, Nelson Mandela's name is written on the short list of people's liberators. His fight goes beyond borders and brings us back to the point: the equality of humans and the meaning of life. To be free, live in peace, have access to happiness, "said Maka Kotto. 
"Africa and the whole world have become bigger, more beautiful, more noble after its passage, and we owe him eternal recognition. I think it's by continuing, all over the planet, the struggle for freedom and equality between all we can make him the most beautiful tribute. Â» 
Nelson Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo. Wishing to fight the injustices and to fight in favor of the recognition of equal rights, he obtained a law degree and then joined the African National Congress in 1942. Deficing more and more the apartheid regime, he is arrested and sentenced to five years penitentiary. New accusations are then laid against him, which is worth his life imprisonment. In 1990, Nelson Mandela becomes a free man after being imprisoned for twenty-seven years. May 10, 1994, Mandela is sworn as the first black president of South Africa. 
A hundred heads of state or government, current or antique, crowned heads, spiritual leaders or artists have confirmed their presence in South Africa, with the official tribute ceremonies in Nelson Mandela.
