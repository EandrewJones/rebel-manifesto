Quebec- "During his trip to Ryad in the coming days, Minister Sam Hamad must directly challenge the Government of Saudi Arabia to allow the immediate return of Nathalie Morin and his three children in Quebec.". 
This is what the member for Lac-Saint-Jean asks for official opposition to the international relations of international relations and Francophonie, Alexander Cloutier, after learning that a Minister of the Charest government will be in Saudi Arabia. 
The case of Nathalie Morin, this young Quebec selected against his will in Saudi Arabia since March 2005 by his spouse, Saeed Al-Shahrani, has largely mobilized Quebec public opinion. It is physically and psychologically abused, lack of food and saw locked in an apartment of which only Saeed al-Shahrani has the key. His three young children, Samir, Abdullah and Sarah, undergo the same abuse. Even today, Saudi Arabia does not allow Ms. Morin and his children to leave the country. 
"Minister Hamad can not be limited to doing business in Saudi Arabia. He has the responsibility, on behalf of the Government of Quebec, to obtain that the Saudi authorities quickly issue the necessary documents to allow Mrs Morin to leave the country. Already Canada has completed all the necessary conditions to welcome Ms Morin and his family, "said Alexandre Cloutier. 
The member reminds that the National Assembly adopted two motions supporting the steps to allow Nathalie Morin and his children to return to Quebec. "In June, the Prime Minister of Quebec, Jean Charest, said to be preoccupied and undertook to do everything for the return of Mrs Morin. Minister Hamad therefore has the duty to represent Quebec and to make the mandate entrusted by his Prime Minister and the National Assembly to cease the violation of Madame Morin's fundamental rights and three children. It is more than the time they come back to Quebec, "concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
