The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Agnès Maltais, proposes to modify three social assistance measures. It will meet tomorrow the common front of the social assistance, the collective of the fight against poverty and the collective March 8 to discuss it. All these measures aim to update rules that no longer correspond to the reality of today, and break the circle of poverty through employment. 
Unlike Ottawa Employment Insurance reform, Minister Maltais proposes measures to support providers to employment, support them in their efforts and release them misery. In contrast to the federal government, Quebec has chosen to accompany people instead of abandoning them. 
These efforts are part of the strategy all for employment, made public on February 8 and endowed with a budget of $ 463 million a year, and aimed at integrating underrepresented customers on the market. work. 
All those who will participate in the measures to integrate the labor market will therefore have access to an individual path to a $ 195 allowance instead of $ 129. The people affected by these amendments will receive a letter inviting them to report to their local employment center (CLE) and have priority access to meet an employment aid. The latter will accompany them so that they take advantage of the services offered by Emploi-Québec. 
All those concerned by these changes will be encountered individually. All those who are currently judged by employment and who, in reality, are unfit for work will be granted this status. 
The government does not want to impoverish anyone. On the contrary, social assistance providers will be able to improve their income by participating in a measure of employment that will report to them $ 195 per month, or by finding a job. 
It is essential to act to break the circle of poverty. And employment is the best way.
