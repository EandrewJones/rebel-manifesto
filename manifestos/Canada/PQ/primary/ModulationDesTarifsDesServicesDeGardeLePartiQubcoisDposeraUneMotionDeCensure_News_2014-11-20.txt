Quebec- The member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, and the member for Terrebonne and Family Spokesperson, Mathieu Traversy, announce that the official opposition will put a motion of censorship to the National Assembly asking parliamentarians to withdraw their confidence in the Liberal government. 
"The Prime Minister promised in the election campaign, but also during his opening speech, not to raise the rates of child care beyond inflation. The model modulation announcement made today means that he lied to the families of Quebec. However, since several parliamentarians, even the Liberals, have apparently issued reservations to this measure, we wish they have the voice of citizens and families of their riding and that they vote in favor of our motion, ". supported Stéphane Bédard. 
"The families of the middle class are attacked directly by the modulation of the rates. They were betrayed by the government. They are disappointed and worried about the future. What budget post will they have to sacrifice? With the implementation of this family tax, the government puts the ax in Quebec's family policy, "concluded Mathieu Traversy.
