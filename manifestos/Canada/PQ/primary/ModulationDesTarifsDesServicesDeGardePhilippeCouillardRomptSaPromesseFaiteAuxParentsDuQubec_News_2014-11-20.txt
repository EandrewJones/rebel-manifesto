Quebec- The hon. Member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, and the member for Terrebonne and Family Spokesperson, Mathieu Traversy, denounce the decision of the Liberal government to modulate the rates of childcare services. parents' income. It is a real betrayal on the part of the Prime Minister, who promised, in the election campaign, not to increase tariffs beyond inflation. 
"The Prime Minister today breaks his promise to Quebec's parents, who are disappointed and worried. It is a great decline for the political environment. What will be the impacts on the families of the middle class? Once again, they are the victims of liberal austerity. How can the minister claim worry about these families, while modulation attacks them directly? In which budget post should they cut? What difficult decisions will have to take in order to pay this new tax? ", Questioned Stéphane Bédard. 
The hon. Member also deplores the Government to have remained deaf to the many demonstrations of the families and stakeholders of the childcare network, who demanded the safeguarding of our family policy. 
"While we are celebrating the International Day of the Rights of the Child today and that our family policy makes the pride of all Quebeckers, the government decides to slash its measures, thanks to which young parents were able to reconcile life family, work and studies. Women were able to invest in mass the labor market. Children enjoy accessible and quality child care, devoted to their development and well-being. The government puts the ax in this family policy, and families will pay the price, "concluded Mathieu Traversy.
