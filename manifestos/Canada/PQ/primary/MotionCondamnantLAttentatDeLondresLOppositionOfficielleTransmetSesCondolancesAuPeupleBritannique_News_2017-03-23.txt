Quebec- In the wake of the bombing near the British Parliament, London, the Parti Québécois has supported a motion presented to the National Assembly expressing the solidarity of the Quebec nation with regard to the British. 
"The horror has false innocent lives again yesterday in London. Today we learn that the people of Antwerp, Belgium, has been the subject of a similar attempt. These unspeakable attacks call us because they target our most expensive values. But our democratic, pluralistic and humanistic societies can not be shaken and will show the necessary resilience in the circumstances. All our thoughts go to the eclored people and the victims of this terrorist act, "said the leader of the official opposition, Jean-François Lisée. 
For his part, Stéphane Bergeron, spokesman for the Quebecois party in international relations, intervened very felt. "Parliament is the house of the people. Attacking this institution is attacking the very essence of democracy, freedom. I also have a thought for those who, on a daily basis, involve their own safety to ensure ours. Every morning we are lucky and the privilege of waking up in a peaceful and safe society. But, if we can benefit from such a tranquility, it is because thousands of people watch over us, day and night, 365 days a year. Unfortunate events like those in London yesterday, and in Antwerp today remind us that we must never lower the guard. »
