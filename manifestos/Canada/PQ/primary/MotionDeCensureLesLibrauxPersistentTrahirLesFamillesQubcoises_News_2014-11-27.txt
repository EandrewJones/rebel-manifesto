Quebec- The hon. Member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, and the member for Terrebonne and Family Spokesperson, Mathieu Traversy, require the Prime Minister that he recedes about the modulation of the rates of Custody services, a measure that breaks another of its election promises and that denounce the families of Quebec. 
"The Prime Minister was elected by promising to cancel the $ 2 increase in the child care rate, which had been announced before the elections: first broken promise. Then he knew the real situation of the public finances at the moment he entrusted the Minister with the need to develop the network and prevent a tariff shock; He denied his word a second time. Quebeckers did not vote for that; The government deliberately broke the bond of trust with the population, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
Added to this, the cessation of the development of the places in custody, as confirmed, in soft, the Liberal government in a statement, on November 20th. 
"This other betrayal is greatly disappointing families and worries parents looking for a place in care for their toddler. Instead of fulfilling his commitment and developing CPE places, the government brakes almost a majority of projects and opens up the door to non-subsidized private childcare, "added Mathieu Traversy. 
"Liberal members had the opportunity today to bring the family's voice of their riding. However, they voted to support the government, despite the fact that he betrayed the families by denying the election promise he had made. It will be up to them to explain to the parents their decision to endorse the break of the promise of their Prime Minister, "concluded the official opposition.
