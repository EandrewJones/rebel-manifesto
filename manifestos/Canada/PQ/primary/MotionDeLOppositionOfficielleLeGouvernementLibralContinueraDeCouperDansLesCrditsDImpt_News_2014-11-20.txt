Québec- The member for Rousseau and the official opposition for the finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, denounces the liberal intentions of continuing to cut into business tax credits. The government has voted against a motion calling for the maintenance of these tax credits, presented today to the National Assembly by the member. 
"This week, Minister Jacques Daoust has launched a pavement in the pond by disagreeing with the cuts in the tax credits. These cuts hurt economic development and job creation. In several areas of excellence in Quebec, these tax credits have allowed many companies to grow and make their mark. In addition, despite the current economic situation, where 82,000 full-time jobs have been lost since the arrival of the Liberals, they still have no economic plan. All they offer to businesses is uncertainty and worry, "said Nicolas Marceau.

"That the National Assembly approves the position of the Minister of Economy, Innovation and Exports that we must maintain tax credits for video play companies, aeronautics, the technologies of the Information and cultural enterprises. » 
"The CAQ, for its part, has shown its usual amateurism by demanding the government that it reduces tax aid to businesses, which is virtually all of the sums currently allocated. François Legault had the opportunity to learn, during the debate surrounding the motion, that the credits that can be modified or abolished do not total $ 4 billion, as he has claimed several times, but half of that amount . Should we understand that the head of the CAQ wants to cut all the tax assistance given to companies? ", Concluded Nicolas Marceau.
