Quebec- The hon. Member for Matane-Matapédia and official opposition on public safety, Pascal Bérubé, regrets that the Liberal government voted against a motion that would have made that exceptionally, the next Director General of The security of Quebec (SQ) be appointed by the parliamentarians of the National Assembly. 
"The Liberal Party was searched by the police and is currently under investigation. He can not name the next Leader of Quebec Security, it would be simply unacceptable! Why refuse parliamentarians hear the presidential candidates? Why refuse that the next Director General of SQ be appointed by parliamentarians? Why these maneuvers of the Minister of Public Safety to avoid being transparent? "Asked Pascal Bérubé. 
"During his appointment, the Minister of Public Safety, Lise Thériault, said she intended to make the appointment process of the director of the SQ more transparent. Unfortunately, we understand today that it was only beautiful words and that it personally hears to choose who will be the next number one of the SQ, "added the member. 
The motion rejected by the Liberals requested that the Committee on Institutions carries out the hearing of the three candidates recommended by the selection committee set up by the Minister of Public Safety.
