Member for Sanguinet and official opposition for the work and pension plans, Alain Therrien, regrets that the Liberal government refused to commit to that municipalities file up-to-date actuarial assessments At the Régie des Pentes du Québec, so that work on Bill 3 be made with all cause. 
"It's a crucial bill for the future of Quebec. We all agree that to ensure the sustainability of municipal pension plans is important. We do not want to look at it athow; We want to have very specific information about the magnitude of the problem. It is flaunting that Minister Pierre Moreau refused to support us so that the detailed study of the bill "said Alain Therien said correctly. 
The motion rejected by the Liberals reads as follows: 
"That the National Assembly requires municipalities and cities that they provide, by September 30, 2014, their actuarial assessments up to 31 December 2013 at the Régie des Anntes du Québec; 
That the Régie des rentes du Québec transmits these actuarial assessments, before 9 October 2014, to the Secretariat of the Commissions of the National Assembly; 
And that this motion be an order of the assembly. »
