Québec- The member for Joliette and spokespersons of the Parti Québécois in the field of culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, deplores the imminent closure of the archives of the museums of the Civilization of Quebec. 
"Access to the archives of the museums of civilization will be closed for an indefinite period. This bad news is another example of the harmful impacts of liberal austerity. Suddenly, a whole pan of our national heritage - so important for our researchers that it is recognized by UNESCO - disappears. For two years, this government has been running cultural and heritage institutions in a deplorable way. It shows total improvisation, "denounced the member for Joliette. 
"The government is entirely responsible for what is happening. What we are witnessing today is exactly the kind of situation that occurs when decisions are subject to the accounting vision and short term of the Treasury Board, rather than being taken in the light of a real Cultural vision. And, again, as it became the rule, Minister Fortin looks at the arms crossed. That can not continue! Added Véronique Hivon.
