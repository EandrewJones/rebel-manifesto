Quebec, August 15, 2017- The official opposition to secularism, Agnès Maltese, today presented the bulk of the amendments it will table in the detailed study of the bill on the religious neutrality of the state. 
IN SHORT 
"The amendments we wanted to find in the bill have been transmitted to the Liberal government almost a year ago. The Minister of Justice was very late, under the pretext of submitting his proposals for amendment to the Liberal caucus before resuming the study of the bill. We hope she did her homework. This bill must be a step forward for Quebec and not a decline, as is the case of the original version, "first insisted Agnès Maltese. 
The spokesperson recalls some significant amendments proposed last fall: "We must register the principle of the institution of the state and that of equality between women and men in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms . It is also necessary to prohibit the signs of religious conviction for persons in position of authority, and add the reserve duty of civil servants, "she listed. 
"It is also essential to delete from the bill the exception concerning the prohibition of the face covered in the provision and receipt of public services, and to add the express prohibition of the port of Chador in the Quebec public service. Finally, it is necessary to resume control over demands for religious accommodation and draw tags so that practices in this area are clear and uniforms everywhere in the two major public service networks, "concluded Agnès Maltese
