Québec - Minister Delegate to Aboriginal Affairs, Mrs. Elizabeth Larouche, says confidently to arrive at a final agreement by October 21, 2013 in the nation-to-nation agreement on the management of natural resources. 
"I am pleased that our government and the Atikamekw have agreed on a three-month postponement in this negotiation. Several issues are about to be settled. I have no doubt that this short time will allow us to find common ground. » 
Recall that last summer, the Government of Quebec and the Atikamekw Nation had agreed to give rise until July 21, 2013 to conclude a final agreement aimed at: guaranteeing better access to natural resources for the Atikamekw, to promote the sharing of the Economic benefits and establish a co-management formula. 
Given the complexity and importance of the file, Minister Larouche made a priority. "The negotiations have never ceased since my entry into office. Bimensual meetings were held almost systematically. Two high-level political tables bringing together the Three Chefs Atikamekw, the Minister of Natural Resources, Martine Ouellet, and myself were also held to untie the stalemate surrounding certain issue issues, "said Minister Larouche. 
The Quebec government also laid concrete actions to demonstrate its good faith. Last May, Ministers Larouche and Ouellet have agreed to implement urgent measures, providing a volume of wood and additional silvicultural work to preserve jobs in Atikamekw communities. Finally, last week, Minister Larouche presented to the Chiefs an offer to try to conclude a final agreement. 
"Despite all our efforts, no mutually satisfactory solution has so far emerged from the negotiations. This is a complex file and you have to take the time needed to find an innovative and acceptable result for both parties. For the Quebec government, the solution goes through trading. "Ms. Larouche concluded.
