Québec- The member for Taillon and spokesperson for the official health and accessibility of care, Diane Lamarre, and the hon. Member for Richelieu and Spokesperson for Treasury Board, Élian Zakaïb, ask again At the Prime Minister to withdraw the file of negotiations with physicians from the Minister of Health and Social Services, Gaétan Barrette. 
"It lasts for months; The Minister Barrette can not obviously override his conflict of interest. It is a doctor who has negotiated for doctors and who, now, negotiates on the other side of the table, on behalf of taxpayers. Let's add to that the premium of 1.2 million that he pocketed for his work. The solution, from the start, was to entrust the file to another negotiator. We ask Philippe Couillard to use its common sense, to end this conflict of interest and let the President of the Treasury Board, Martin Caitous, negotiate with the doctors, "said Élain Zakaïb. 
The hon. Member for Richelieu recalls that on the schedule he gives himself to reach an agreement, the Minister Barrette has already changed speeches several times. Today, it is the return to Parliament that is invoked to justify its laxity. However, as this agreement will greatly influence the finances of Quebec, it is imperative to quickly conclude the negotiations, according to it. 
"Instead of standing physicians with these negotiations, the Minister Barrette should rather think of a plan for mobilizing all medical staff, including physicians, to improve access to care, while providing for indicators. accounts, "said Diane Lamarre for his part. 
"The lack of credibility of the Minister Barrette is harming the entire government. It's not too late to restore the situation. Before passing a special law on an agreement that Dr. Barrette himself concluded in favor of physicians, Philippe Couillard must withdraw the mandate to negotiate with them, "said Élain Zakaïb.
