Quebec? The Prime Minister of Quebec, Pauline Marois, accompanied by the Minister of Labor, Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Agnès Maltese, today announced the appointment of a special mediator, Normand Gauthier, with the aim of finding a solution to the working conflict that continues in the construction industry. The mandate of the latter will be to deploy, at the institutional and industrial table, all the necessary efforts to intensify the dynamics of the negotiation and bring the employer and the union part towards the conclusion of an agreement before the end of the week. 
"Experienced mediator, Mr. Gauthier will take advantage of his know-how to try to bring together the parties in this crucial stage of the negotiations," said the Prime Minister. 
Normand Gauthier intervened in many cases, including that of the working conflict at the Quebec Construction Commission in 2012. He also worked at the Ministry of Labor for 22 years, including as a conciliator mediator. He finished his career as a subcommittee, in 2001, before becoming President of the Essential Services Board until 2007. 
"I thank Normand Gauthier for agreeing to meet this challenge that affects a neuralgic sector in our economy, in each of Quebec regions. I am formally asking parties to put aside their differences in order to quickly reach a compromise, for the benefit of the entire population, "concluded the Minister of Labor, Agnès Maltese. 
The Premier also advisted the agreement in the civil engineering sector and roads, which puts the strike for more than 41,000 construction workers, who will return to work from Tuesday. This agreement in principle demonstrates that a negotiated settlement is possible.
