Quebec- The member for Sanguinet and official opposition spokesperson for work, Alain Therrien, believes that the Minister of Labor, Sam Hamad, acts irresponsibly by brandishing the threat of a special law to impose the conditions in the construction industry, while the negotiations are continuing. 
"A negotiated agreement is always better than an agreement imposed. By its inappropriate remarks at this time of negotiation, the minister may push us to an imposed agreement. He breaks the balance of forces between the bosses and the unions, while his role is, precisely, to maintain this balance in the world of work, "said Alain Therien. 
Let's remember the tabling of the Special Law last year, the Parti Québécois proposed that it is stealing for a period of four, then two years, to allow the dust to fall. 
"Unfortunately, the Liberals and the Caquists have ignored expert opinions and have chosen the deadline of June 30, 2014. Today, the Minister must repair his mistake and put in place for a successful negotiation by the 22 July ", concluded the spokesperson.
