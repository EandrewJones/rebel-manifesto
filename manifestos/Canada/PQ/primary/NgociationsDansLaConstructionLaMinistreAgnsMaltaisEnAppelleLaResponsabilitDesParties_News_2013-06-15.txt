Association of the construction of Quebec (ACQ) Ms. Lyne Marcoux 
Association of Road Builders and Great Works of Quebec (ACRGTQ) m. Guy Duchesne 
Provincial Association of Quebec Housing Builders (APCHQ) m. Dominique Robertobjet: Negotiations of collective agreements in the construction industry 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
Negotiations for the renewal of the different collective agreements are at a turning point. The parties to one of the tables would have even ceased their work. 
There is no need to remind you of the importance of issues and the fact that neither entrepreneurs nor workers and even less people want a working conflict in this nervical sector. The context has changed and open conflict is no longer a mode of dispute resolution. 
You have been chosen by your peers to carry out these negotiations. I remind you of your personal responsibility to make every effort to arrive at a settlement that necessarily passes through the negotiation and therefore by compromise. 
I ask that the exchanges to the tables resume or continue, as the case may be, and that you stop using the "public place" for interventions which anyway are unproductive in the eyes of citizens. 
Counting on your prompt collaboration, I beg you to accept, Madam, Gentlemen, the expression of my distinguished feelings. 
The Minister of Labor, 
Original signed by 
Agnès Maltese
