Here it is, the slogan of the Parti Québécois for the countryside that begins! The elections of September 4 are very important for our future. And it's a choice that belongs to us, Quebeckers. It's up to us to choose. 
We have the choice to have an honest government and integrates to restore to Quebec's confidence in their institutions. A government in the service of its citizens, and attentive! 
We have the choice to affirm our values, our language, our history, our identity. The choice to stand in front of Ottawa! The choice to become a country! 
We have the choice to enrich Quebec. The choice to resume control of our natural resources and our destiny for the benefit of all Quebeckers. To enrich our families, our young people, our elders, our cities and our regions! 
We have the choice to help us. The choice to build our future with education and put in place a real home care policy. The choice to take care of our elders, to take care of families, take care of young people. Because we need each other! 
This slogan also embodies our intention to make a positive campaign by offering our choices to Quebecers. We will leave our opponents with denigration campaigns. Of course, we will respond to false attacks, but we will maintain our intention to propose ideas to advance Quebec and Quebeckers. 
Because we have a vision for the future, because we have ideas to offer, because another Quebec is possible! And it's up to us to choose!
