Longueuil- After a meeting with the members of the Union of Agricultural Farmers (UPA), the Prime Minister of Quebec and Head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, is committed to continuing the implementation of the Food Sovereignty. 
"This policy, which affects the entire Quebec agricultural and bioalimentary sector, has been expected for many years. The Liberal government has never wanted to propose such a policy. On our side, we are aiming for the production of quality Quebec foods and want them to take more space on the plate of Quebecers. We also want to develop a prosperous bioalimentary sector, remunerative, employment generator and environmentally friendly, "the premier said. 
Already, the government of the Parti Québécois acted by implanting several concrete measures: 
"My government has made concrete, strong and creative gestures to support and grow the bioalimentary sector in Quebec. From the agricultural producer to the government institutions, we want to create quality jobs in each region. We are determined to build a stronger and more independent Quebec in the agricultural and bioalimentary field, "concluded Pauline Marois. 
We have a plan and the team to succeed. Today, it's time to give us the means to go further.
