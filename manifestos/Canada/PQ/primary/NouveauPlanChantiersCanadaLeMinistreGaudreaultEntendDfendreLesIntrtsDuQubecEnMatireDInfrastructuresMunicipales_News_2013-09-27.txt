Gatineau - the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the Territory and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, wishes to take advantage of the presence of the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs, Mr. Denis Lebel, at The meeting of provincial and territorial ministers responsible for local governments to present its claims within the framework of the next Plan Building Canada. 
"It is essential to defend the interests of Quebec. That's why I intend to make the federal government understand that municipal affairs fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces and territories. This is a fundamental principle that must be respected, "said Gaudreault. 
In this sense, the minister wishes to recall that he opposes any direct intervention by the federal government to municipalities. However, Quebec municipalities have great infrastructure needs and, to fill them, massive investments will have to be made in the coming years. The Government of Quebec expects to receive its fair share of federal infrastructure funds. 
"In the interest of efficiency, I reiterate the importance that this funding share will be transferred to us. This way of proceeding will accelerate project implementation and promote our economic growth, "added the minister. 
Among the other demands of the minister, stress that it claims that the federal government's negotiating timeline is adjusted since it is not suitable for Quebec reality and that it jeopardizes the next construction season in municipalities. 
"I wish the claims that I will exhibit in the context of this meeting be heard and that they lead to concrete gestures from the federal government," the minister concluded.
