Quebec- The member for Bourget and sentence of the official immigration opposition, Maka Kotto, asks Minister Kathleen Weil the extension of the auditions of the public consultation towards a new Quebec immigration policy, of diversity and inclusion. 
"We have to have more time to hear groups and citizens. Many people want to participate in this consultation. Parliamentarians should be submitted to the set of opinions relevant to the work relating to the new immigration policy. The minister has concocted his closed consultation document with groups that she has personally selected last summer. She even made them sign a confidentiality agreement. So there are groups that have had the privilege of being heard twice. Why some and not others? Why a confidentiality agreement? Obviously, the minister has his idea in mind for the new policy. On our side, we believe that everyone needs to be heard, for the sake of transparency and equity, "said Maka Kotto. 
The member emphasized the importance of this work on the new immigration policy. "So many issues need to be taken into account by the minister, among other things, the place to occupy French in the new policy, the problems of underemployment and discrimination affecting immigrants and adoption citizens, regionalization. , the diversity of basins, the recognition of skills, the definition of the concept of interculturalism. To accomplish the work properly, the public consultation must be extended, "concluded Maka Kotto.
