Quebec- The member for Bourget and sentence of the official immigration opposition and head of the Charter of the French language, Maka Kotto, regrets that the liberal government majority be completely closed to the recommendations he made , while the Committee on Relations with the Citizens was reunited in the work session at the end of the public consultations on the documents entitled from a new Quebec immigration policy, diversity and inclusion. 
"In addition to refusing to hear several groups and citizens who wanted to participate in the consultations, the Liberal deputation rejected all our recommendations. Minister Weil had an idea in mind, to listen to the groups she had previously chosen for closed consultations. It is therefore not surprising that Liberal members, in turn, also dismissed any proposal to enhance the new immigration policy, "said Maka Kotto. 
Since the minister has categorically refused to pursue public consultations, the member for Bourget believed to share a series of nine recommendations. However, they have all been rejected. "By adopting this posture of the refusal, the Liberal members voted against the availability of resources in the region for the integration of immigrants, against the maintenance of the requirements for the control of French, and against the dissociation of the immigration policy. That of the fight against fundamentalism, "denounced Maka Kotto.
