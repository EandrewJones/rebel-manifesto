Minister Laurent Lessard must finally act, "said Daniel Ratthé, recalling to have questioned, at multiple occasions in the National Assembly for a year, the Liberal government on the municipal administration in Laval. 
He criticizes the Liberal government to make two weights on two measures from some municipal governments. "In the case of Mascouche, the Minister of Municipal Affairs had no discomfort last winter to ask the Mayor to think about his future. Why does not it do so with the mayor of Laval, where troubling information about it multiply? Mr. Rathedh is questioned. 
To this information revealed today about political funding by public funds are added the scandal of wetlands, as well as the concentration of the genius contracts granted to the same firms and the alleged attempt of corruption unveiled by the Liberal member. From Vimont, Vincent Auclair, and the former Minister of Justice and Public Security, Serge Ménard. 
"Laurent Lessard must demonstrate that the Liberal government wants probity in the municipal world, even though the Liberal Party needs Gilles Vaillancourt for elections, as the former Minister Thomas Mulcair said. The word is no longer enough, it takes gestures, "said Daniel Ratthaé.
