Montreal- The issue of possible alliances between the Parti Québécois and other sovereignist and progressive forces is the subject of discussions within the Caucus and the Pauline Marois team for several weeks. 
In December, the leader of the Parti Québécois asked his team to more concretely evaluate the possible reconciliation tracks and carry out a fine analysis of the advantages and disadvantages that could behave. 
This analysis is in progress and should make it possible to fuel the discussion. 
Several Caucus members interested in these issues were informed of the conduct of this analysis and, through informal contacts, the interest of Pauline Marois by this question was transmitted to Quebec Solidarity. 
The objective of the approach is to have the greatest number of sovereignist deputies in the National Assembly.
