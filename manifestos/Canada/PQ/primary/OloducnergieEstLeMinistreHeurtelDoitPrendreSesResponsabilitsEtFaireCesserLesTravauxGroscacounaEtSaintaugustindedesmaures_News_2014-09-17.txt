Quebec- The member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesman in sustainable development and the environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, and the member for Marie-Victorin and spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, urge the Minister of Sustainable Development, the Environment and Fighting Climate Change, David Heurtel, to take his responsibilities and put an end to TransCanada's work in Gros-Cacouna and Saint-Augustin- de-desmales. 
"Minister HROLETEL issues permissions to the room, without waiting to have the overall portrait of the BAPE that it has promised, but still waiting. He chose to endanger the belluga nursery by allowing big-cacouna work. Even worse, he relies totally to Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The only thing the minister did is promise that the work will stop at the passage of Belugas, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
The member for Marie-Victorin reminded him that the profits of the project are far from being convincing for Quebeckers. "This pipeline project, in its current form, does not serve our interests. Quebec should not become a highway to take out the oil oil from Alberta. Environmental risks, in addition to those related to safety, are disproportionate to anticipated economic benefits, "he supported. 
"By its replies, Minister Heurtel has demonstrated that he is unable to enforce the ecological integrity of our territory. He accepts without bronching that we are no longer masters of our sustainable development and others make the decisions in our place, "concluded the hon. Member for Jonquière.
