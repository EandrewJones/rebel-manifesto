In the House this morning, the member asked the minister where $ 1.2 million was placed on the financing of organizations whose mission to integrate women into the labor market, particularly the poorest women. 
These organizations are present in 11 regions and support hundreds of women. Their unique expertise was the subject of a thorough study and was recognized in 2014 by the Ministry of Employment and Social Solidarity. Yesterday, they stated that they still have not received the sums they have been granted for 8 years and that allow them to support their particular mission with women. 
"We are witnessing another liberal attack against women. This situation threatens regional economic development and causes the abolition of posts and services that address women, including young monopterated mothers who want to break the cycle of poverty. Once again, the Liberal government puts the weight of austerity to women. It's aberrant! "Denounced Carole Poirier. 
The hon. Member further deplores the minister's response, which merely said that organizations had to make efforts and tighten the belt. "Again, the Minister of Status of Women has failed in his task; She did not know how to defend the women of Quebec. She has chosen to give priority to austerity, to the detriment of well-being and respect for the economic rights of women. I have never seen this! She concluded.
