Quebec- The member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and sentence of the official opposition in terms of women, Carole Poirier, strongly denounces the 60% cuts imposed on the 16 specialized agencies in the development of the women's labor force by The Minister of Status of Women, St√©phanie Valley. 
"While the needs are growing, the budget of these agencies increased from $ 1.2 million to $ 500,000. Is the minister aware of what his decision means? Does it know that thousands of vulnerable, isolated or single-parent women, often struggling with financial, dependence or violence, have benefited from the support and specific approach of these organizations, which accompany them in their integration or their reintegration into the labor market? ", Asked Carole Poirier. 
"After the compressions in home help, in programs promoting women's accession to decision-making positions, in assisting homework, after the postponement of CPE places development, the significant increase in service tariffs Custody, and I pass, a new measure comes directly to the women. The austerity imposed by the Liberal Government further affects women, including women in the region; This is recently affirmed, a study of IRIS, "continued the spokesperson. 
Carole Poirier argues that by acting in this way, the government goes downright against the principles it claims to defend. "The Liberals are trying to fall asleep with their beautiful speeches, when in reality, their actions affect equal opportunities and employment development, and help maintain the most vulnerable women in poverty. I ask Minister Stephanie Valley to stand up and fight for the budgets dedicated to women's employment agencies, "she claimed.
