Quebec- At the end of the first week of special consultations on Bill 3 on pension plans, the member for Sanguinet and official opposition spokesman in this area, Alain Therien, invites the government again To be open to improve the bill, in the best interest of taxpayers, workers, municipalities and retirees. 
"Ensure the sustainability and financial health of pension plans is a goal shared by all. The testimonials heard this week allow us to better measure the impacts of several aspects of the Liberal bill. The issue of fully capitalized plans is particularly involved, as is the situation of current retirees, "said Alain Therien. 
The spokesperson recalls that the two main concerns of the Parti Québécois remain, that is, the unique solution proposed by the Government and the respect of the signed conventions. 
"The fact that Bill 3 affects all pension plans, regardless of their real situation, remains anxiety. In addition, the negotiated collective agreements should not be lost; It is important to respect them, to preserve balance. It was also an objective that we had when we tabled Bill 79, which was consensus, "concluded the member for Sanguinet.
