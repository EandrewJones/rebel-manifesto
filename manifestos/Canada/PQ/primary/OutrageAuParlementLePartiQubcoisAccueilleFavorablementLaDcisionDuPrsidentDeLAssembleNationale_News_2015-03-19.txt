Quebec- The member for Taschereau and the Parliamentary Leader of the Official Opposition, Agnès Maltese, welcomes the decision of the President of the National Assembly, who acknowledged that the Minister of Municipal Affairs and the Occupation of the Territory, Pierre Moreau, had, at first glance, committed an outrage in Parliament by avoiding two articles related to the abolition of elected regional conferences in Bill 28, Act, mainly concerning the implementation of certain provisions of the speech on the Budget of June 4, 2014 and aimed at the return to a balanced budget in 2015-16, before its adoption. Remember that the principle of Bill 28 has been adopted yesterday and that its detailed study begins today. 
The proof submitted by the Leader of the Official Opposition has convinced the Presidency that the minister's actions held, at first sight, the abolition of the regional conferences of the elected representatives and the constitution of the transition committees related to this abolition, aspects discussed by Bill 28. However, this one is not yet adopted. 
"What the President has just reaffirmed, it is not that it is not Pierre Moreau or the Liberal government that decides on the schedule for the adoption of bills, but the National Assembly," said Agnès Maltese. 
The Chair's decision indicates that "an outrage in Parliament is an act or omission that has the effect of hindering the work of the Assembly or its members, or to undermine their authority or dignity." 
As the leader of the official opposition has argued, the parliamentary wing of the Parti Québécois will make its intentions in the future with respect to the contempt of Parliament committed by Pierre Moreau.
