Montreal - It is this morning that the forum on mineral royalties at HEC Montr√©al is opened. This important advisory exercise combines the same table with representatives from the environments concerned by the issue of mining royalties. 
"Today, we will be very attentive to the exchanges that will take place. They will feed our reflection and decisions on a new mining tax system, "the Minister of Natural Resources, Martine Ouellet, and the Minister of Finance and the Economy, Nicolas Marceau gaming. 
The Quebec Minor Tax Plan, published last week, confirmed the government's intention to increase royalties. The government wants to improve the sharing of wealth created and wants all companies to contribute minimally to this goal. Today's discussions will focus on how to achieve this, the different options and possible solutions. 
"Ultimately, the government's goal is to put in place a mining system ensuring that all Quebeckers are taking out their fair share and take full advantage of the value of resources available on their territory. It must also create a competitive and stable environment that can attract new investments to Quebec, "support the two ministers.
