"When re-evaluating the rules of the race on March 20, we were committed to acting on new developments. Today, it is our duty to set the example and to respect the government's demand: putting Quebec, as well as all non-essential activities, paused. Faced with the unprecedented pandemic to which Quebec faces, all our energies must be devoted to the resolution of this crisis, "said Agnès Maltais, president of election of the Parti Québécois. 
Therefore, today, the reception of the signatures related to the race at the chieftaincy is suspended. The suspension of donations will be effective from Monday, March 30th. The Coordination Conference will meet again within a maximum of 30 days to assess the possibility of reopening the nomination period. Following the recovery, a period of 21 days will be granted to candidates to finish the collection of their signatures. 
Also note that with the exception of the end date of the nomination period, the timetable adopted on March 20 by the Coordination Conference remains, for the moment, unchanged.
