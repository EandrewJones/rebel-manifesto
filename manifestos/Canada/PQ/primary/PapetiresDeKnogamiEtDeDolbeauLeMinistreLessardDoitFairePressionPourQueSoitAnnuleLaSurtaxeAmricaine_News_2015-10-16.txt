Quebec- The hon. Member for Bonaventure and spokesman for the Quebec's Forest Party, Sylvain Roy, urges the Minister of Forests, Laurent Lessard, to put pressure on the federal government to negotiate the cancellation of the surcharge imposed on the Exporting overcrowder paper from Kenogami and Dolbeau factories. 
"This surcharge is a real shot for the workers of the Dolbeau and Kenogami paperworkers, as for the entire forest economy of Quebec. The Minister of Forests must take responsibility and ask Ottawa to cancel this surcharge that threatens forest communities in Quebec. It is more than 300 direct jobs that are affected by this American measure, in addition to indirect jobs related to the two factories, "said Sylvain Roy. 
Auspicious 
The hon. Member for Bonaventure further fears that if the Canadian government does not negotiate a new agreement quickly, this decision of the US Department is only a prelude to a new timber war. 
"The Americans are dealing today with the overcut paper from Quebec, but they could soon tackle the lumber, if a new agreement is not negotiated in the short term. Minister Lessard must defend the Quebec forest regime with the federal government, in order to avoid a new conflict that could close the US market with Quebec exporters and, as well, cause several hundred job losses in the regions of Quebec, "concluded Sylvain Roy.
