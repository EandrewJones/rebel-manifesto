Quebec- Lergement on target benefits pension plans for some companies in the pulp and paper sector is published in the Gazette officielle du Québec. It will come into effect in two weeks, on November 21, 2013. 
The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity and Minister responsible for the Régie des Annue du Québec, Ms. Agnès Maltais, explained that "the publication of this Regulation constitutes the last governmental obligation necessary for the payment of a portion of the Rennies reductions, suffered by the syndicated pensioners of papers White Birch ". The minister now wants the company to take effect without delay for the good of retirees. 
The government has been celebrated on this issue so that the new pension plans for White Birch papers are registered. According to the agreement between the union and the company, registration regimes will allow the restoration of a portion of the pensioner pension, and this, retroactively. 
"Today, we are crossing an important step in this sad file that has lasted too much. We have been present for workers and retirees from White Birch paper mills since our entry into office and we continue to put all the pressure for their annuity to be restored, "added the minister. 
The regulation in question establishes the rules on the functioning of target pension schemes (CPPCs) of White Birch papers. It also applies to resolved forest product regimes. It follows the law allowing the establishment of target benefit pension plans in some companies in the pulp and paper sector (adopted on 6 December 2012) as well as agreements between these companies and their respective unions. 
These RRPCs are retroactive as of January 1, 2011 for forest products resolved and since September 13, 2012, for White Birch paper.
