Quebec- Following the statements of the Federal Minister of Justice on the supposed bilingualism required for the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court, the member for Joliette and spokesman of the Quebecois party on justice, Véronique Hivon, so That the member for Verchères and spokespersons on Quebec-Canada relations, Stéphane Bergeron, denounced the full silence of the Liberal government about the new definition of bilingualism given by Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould. 
"The Trudeau government announcement was obviously only powder. The definition of the minister's bilingualism is unacceptable, especially since it highlights a total misunderstanding of Quebec and the French fact. Does the Prime Minister of Quebec agree with such a definition? What is, in his opinion, the requirement that should be for the judges of the Supreme Court? Requested Véronique Hivon. 
"We see again that despite the beautiful speeches, Justin Trudeau's federal government does not understand Quebec. Another promise flies themselves up in smoke, in the total indifference of the Liberal government of Quebec and its Minister responsible for Canadian Relations and Francophonie, Jean-Marc Fournier, "added Stéphane Bergeron.
