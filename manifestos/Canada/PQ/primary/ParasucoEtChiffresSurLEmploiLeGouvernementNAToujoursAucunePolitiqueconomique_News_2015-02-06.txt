Quebec- The member for Saint-Jérôme and sentence of the official opposition in the area of economics, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, as well as the member for Saint-Jean and spokesman In terms of employment, Dave Turcotte, deplore the closure of parasuco shops, a Quebec company, and, therefore, the loss of dozens of jobs. 
"After Jacob, Mexx and Smart Set, Parasuco today announced the closure of his 6 shops in Quebec, forcing his workers to find a new job. The government must finally realize that its "liberal effect" gives nothing; People continue to lose their job in Quebec, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
The hon. Member for Saint-Jérôme wonders if the Government of Philippe Couillard realizes that its leaving goes to the financial health of Quebec families. "The all-round cuts of the government, combined with massive job losses since its arrival, ensure that Quebec families suffer; There are fewer services, fewer jobs, more taxes and more taxes, but the Liberals, only in their bubble, find that everything is fine. May they wake up! ", he added. 
"The Liberals repeat that the June 2014 budget constitutes their employment plan. However, tax increases and cuts in services can not in any way be considered as a job development plan, "continued the member for Saint-Jérôme. 
Still full-time job losses 
The numbers unveiled this morning by Statistics Canada show that Quebec has lost other full-time jobs, lamented Dave Turcotte. He therefore asks the Government to unveil his plan for employment. "Quebec has lost 4400 full-time jobs in January; What do the Liberals do to stop this hemorrhage? "He said. 
"The government must ensure that Parasuo workers and the 4400 Quebeckers who have lost their full-time jobs in January will find one," said the member for Saint John, adding that "accompanying measures must also be put in place by Jobs-Québec ".
