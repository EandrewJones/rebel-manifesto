Québec- Contrary to what Prime Minister Philippe Couillard says, the new Council of Ministers, unveiled in great pomp yesterday, does not make more room for women, considers the spokesman for the Parti Party for Status of Women and MP of Hochelaga? Maisonneuve, Carole Poirier. 
First, Ms. Poirier insisted that regardless of the number of women who access the Council of Ministers, if the Government continues to move forward with its austerity measures, women would not withdraw none profit. "For the Prime Minister, gender parity is just a slogan, a cosmetic measure. In fact, women are the first victims of liberal austerity. For example, when cutting in the CPEs and in employment aid programs for women to focus on infrastructure projects, which are mainly for men, the cause of women recedes, it's undeniable She said from the entry. 
In addition, the exercise carried out yesterday by the Prime Minister is not concluding in terms of parity. "If we look at it closely, we see that the envelopes of the ministries entrusted to women represent only 5% of the total budget of the Quebec state. In comparison, last week again, women managed 9% of the Quebec budget, according to the Council of the Statute of Women, which was not already famous. In fact, therefore, the new Couillard government is a symbol of regression in terms of the representation of women in politics, "continued the spokesperson. 
"Obviously, the appointment of a woman at the head of the Ministry of the Economy is one thing that one must greet, but this one is in no way a significant budget post, added the member. All large ministries are still led by men. Health, education, family, for example, remain 100% masculine areas. »
