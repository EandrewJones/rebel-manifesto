Quebec - Member for Vachon and spokesperson for the official mines and shale gas opposition, Martine Ouellet, believes that it would be an aberration that the Quebec government is considering participating financially in the gas industry. shale in the current state of affairs. 
"Before thinking about investing, still needed to have popular support. We are far from the account: the social consensus is not at the rendezvous. What we need now is a moratorium, no something else, "said Martine Ouellet. 
It is surprised that the Liberal government also quickly opens the door to this idea launched last week by the industry. "The Liberals repeat tirelessly that it is not the state to take risks. Investing in shale gas, it's a huge risk since this industry goes from bad to worse. The risks are as environmental, social and economic. In short, we are far from the principles of sustainable development and what we see with this rapid opening expressed by Prime Minister Charest is that the government is more in the service of the industry than in the service of the population " , she concluded.
