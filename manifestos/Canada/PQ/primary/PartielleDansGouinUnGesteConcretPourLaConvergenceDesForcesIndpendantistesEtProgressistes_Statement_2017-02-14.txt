The target of the Parti Québécois by 2018 is to gather as widely as possible, in order to replace the Liberals in 2018 by an honest, dynamic, green and common-tight government. 
We could have made a beautiful battle in Gouin, which has been represented for a long time by the Parti Québécois. But we have to see more than a single partial and make decisions based on more important objectives for Quebec. Replacing the Liberals in 2018 by a government serving the common good, preparing Quebec with an appointment with independence in 2022. To get there, we need to add up forces, learn to work together, in respect of our differences. Presenting a candidate in Gouin, it would be mobilizing the squatal and QS activists of the island of Montreal against each other at the very moment when we reflect, each on our side, to the principle of convergence. It would be counterproductive. 
Addition, it's the heart of our action. 
Yes, we have our differences with Quebec Solidaire. Like Jacques Parizeau, Lucien Bouchard and Mario Dumont had theirs when doing common cause for yes in 1995. But on the basis, when he comes time to make common cause, you have to know how to put aside what We divide and work together. 
That is why it seems to me, as to the national executive, unanimous on the question and the executive of the Québécois party of Gouin, that it would be inappropriate to divide us during a partial to be held a year Before the next general elections. 
That Gouin is the laboratory of this convergence desired by a majority of Quebeckers and Quebeckers. 
To this extent, I announce that there will be no candidate or candidate from Quebecois during this partial. 
We will have one year to learn from this gesture of openness and to consider with our supporting counterparts the new possibilities that will offer us during the general election. 
Another step on the way of victories!
