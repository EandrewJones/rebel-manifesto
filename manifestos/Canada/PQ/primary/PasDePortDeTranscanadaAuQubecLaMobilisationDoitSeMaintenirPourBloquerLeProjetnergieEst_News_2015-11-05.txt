Quebec- As TransCanada announced this morning that it abandoned the idea of building an oil export port in Quebec, Quebec's spokesman for sustainable development, environment and climate change. , Mathieu Traversy, calls citizens to remain mobilized to convince the government that the energy project is is harmful to Quebec. 
"The Parti Québécois has been the battle against this project since the beginning, alongside environmental groups and citizens. We mobilized to prevent the construction of a port allowing the export of oil sands oil, and to recognize the right of Quebeckers to decide on the fate of the Energy project. We can not both assume all environmental risks and not have the last word. The Minister of the Environment must reaffirmed Quebec that will make the ultimate decision on this issue, "said the member for Terrebonne. 
The Parti Québécois notes that currently, energy is fighting for its survival. "Already, there were tremendous concerns about the environmental impacts that would come from such a project. And, today, we abandon the idea of a port in Quebec territory, which determines all the more the potential fallout for Quebec. We can therefore legitimately wonder if there are still energy arguments in the government relief kit, "added Mathieu Traversy. 
In addition, the spokesman denounces the fact that the Minister of the Environment only repeats hollow sentences when it comes to ensuring that Quebec environmental laws will be respected. "For a year and a half, TransCanada has refused to transmit the necessary documents to the Ministry of the Environment. In addition, the company has always said that it refused to submit to the decision of the Government of Quebec. How can David Heurtel believe that anyone takes it seriously? ", Concluded the member for Terrebonne.
