Quebec- The Prime Minister of Quebec, Pauline Marois, will be passing through New England on July 17th and 18th. It will meet the governors of four states: Maggie Hassan (New Hampshire), Deval Patrick (Massachusetts), Lincoln Chafee (Rhode Island) and Dannel Malloy (Connecticut), to discuss the issues of the next conference of the Governors of the New England and Prime Ministers of Eastern Canada (CGNA-PMEC), to be held in Malbaie on September 8 and 9, 2013. 
"The Conference of Governors of New England and the Eastern Eastern Ministers is a privileged opportunity for all partners to discuss issues of common interest, including energy, environment and transportation. . It is also for Quebec a forum where it can assert itself as a major player. These meetings are therefore an important milestone for this preparation for the next September conference, "said the Prime Minister. 
Since its creation, in 1973, the CGNA-PMEC is the main multilateral instrument of Quebec to develop its relations with the states of New England. Quebec has been actively involved since its inception, but it is only every 11 years that it can host it.
