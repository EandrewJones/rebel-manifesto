Quebec - The member for Charlevoix and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pauline Marois, expels from the Caucus of the Parti Québécois the member for Blainville, Daniel Ratthé. 
"After a brief meeting with him, I came to the conclusion that I can not trust a member who denies his convictions per opportunity. Out of respect for Caucus members and militants, I can only accept a member of Parliament in our political training as he reflects to join the Future Québec Coalition. The Parti Québécois is a great political training involving militants and activists for whom convictions take over polls. We have great projects for Quebec and we have to rely on people who have the courage to defend their ideas, "said Pauline Marois.
