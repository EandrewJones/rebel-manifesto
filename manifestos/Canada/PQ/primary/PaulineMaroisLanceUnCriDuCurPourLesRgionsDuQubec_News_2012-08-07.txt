Sainte-Anne-des-Monts- The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has launched a real cry of the heart for the regions of Quebec. "Our territory is immense and without its regions, Quebec would not be what it is. It is our duty as Quebec to help us from one region to another, "pleaded Pauline Marois. 
The Parti Québécois offers concrete measures to revive the regions: the creation of the Quebec Economic Development Bank to support regional entrepreneurs and the establishment of a government action group for the Gaspésie, chaired by Pauline Marois. 
"The Gaspesians are very attached to their corner of country and they make every effort to keep their communities and their living villages. Regions like Gaspésie have their own realities and face particular challenges. We are in the poorest MRC of Quebec. I am very touched by the people I met here. We must listen to them and support them! "Exclaimed the leader of the Parti Québécois. 
Pauline Marois also recalled that, unlike other political parties, the Quebecois Party makes regional development a real priority. "I feel a great indifference of other parties with regard to the regions. The only thing Jean Charest does for the Gaspésians is to make them shimmered jobs in the north. As for François Legault, it is the radio silence on the regions of Quebec. For the Liberals and the Caquists, it is as if the people in the regions did not exist, "chained Pauline Marois. 
"I guarantee you that a government of the Parti Québécois will take care of all the regions of Quebec because it is the duty of a prime minister to worry about all Quebeckers. It's all Quebec that must help each other! ", Concluded the leader of the Parti Québécois.
