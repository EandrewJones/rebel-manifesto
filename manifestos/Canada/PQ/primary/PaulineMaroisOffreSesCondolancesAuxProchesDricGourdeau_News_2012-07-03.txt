Montreal- As a result of the death of Éric Gourdau, the member for Charlevoix and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pauline Marois, wanted to pay tribute and to offer his condolences to his family and relatives. 
"Eric Gourdeau has been a great servant of the Quebec nation. Having worked with René Lévesque, including the nationalization of electricity, his career perfectly embodies the heroic era of the construction of the state of Quebec. Collectively, we owe a lot to this group of bold young people, to the sharp spirit, which have built our institutions, "said Pauline Marois. 
The head of the official opposition also stimulated that Éric Gourdeau's contribution was not limited to the time of the quiet revolution. "He devoted his life to throw bridges to indigenous communities, reminding that northern Quebec, to which more and more people are turning, should not be developed to the detriment of people who populate him, but in partnership with them. » 
Eric Gourdau also led the founding of the René-Lévesque House whose objective is to arrange a museum in honor of the former Prime Minister in New Carlisle, Gaspésie. "Until the end of his life, he devoted himself to valuing the history of Quebec and reminding us of our duty of memory at the place of our builders," concluded Pauline Marois.
