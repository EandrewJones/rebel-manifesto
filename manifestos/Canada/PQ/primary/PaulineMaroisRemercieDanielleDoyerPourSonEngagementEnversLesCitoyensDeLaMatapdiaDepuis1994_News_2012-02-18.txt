Dear Colleague, 
It is with regret that I am learning your decision not to solicit a new mandate in the constituency of Matapédia that you have represented so well since 1994. I want to thank you sincerely for your commitment during all these years. 
You are a militant of the first hour for the sovereignty of Quebec and you have been able to defend with energy and relent the citizens of Matapédia for 18 years at the National Assembly. You have never missed an opportunity to challenge appropriate government authorities, to power as in the opposition, to stimulate the economy of your constituency and Bas-Saint-Laurent which has had a lot of difficulties, particularly in the sector. forest. 
I saw you with the work with intensity and courage, with and for your fellow citizens, both in the National Assembly and within our caucus. In the exercise of your functions, you have made the defense with conviction and passion for people with various issues, workers and community organizations. 
I know that the decision you announced today follows a long reflection and that it was not easy to take. I respect your choice and I want to make sure you will miss your colleagues from the National Assembly and Matapédia's militants and citizens. By the next electoral appointment, I am sure you will continue to give the best of yourself. 
I want to thank you sincerely for what you have done for so many years and I thank you in advance for the commitment you make to continue your militant action to make Quebec a country. 
Original signed 
Pauline Marois »
