Quebec- The official Leader of the Official Opposition of Charlevoix, Pauline Marois, commented on the decision of the member for Masson, Guillaume Tremblay, who chooses not to be a candidate for the next general election. 
"I would like to thank Guillaume Tremblay for all the work he has accomplished over the last four years. I saw Guillaume investing with conviction, passion and energy for Masson citizens and help improve their quality of life, "said Pauline Marois. 
"I respect, understand and welcomes Guillaume's decision. When we seek citizens' confidence for a mandate, we must ensure that it is possible to complete it. At a time when the ambient political cynicism reaches an unparalleled level, it is all the honor to make this choice that is his today, "she added. 
"On behalf of all members of the parliamentary wing and on behalf of Quebec's members, thank you Guillaume for your commitment to pursue your militant action to make Quebec a country. I wish you the best chances in your future projects, "concluded Pauline Marois.
