Québec- The member for Charlevoix and Head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, is astonished by the decision of the hon. Member for La Prairie, François Rebello, to leave his political training to join the ranks of the Coalition Future Québec. 
"Just a few weeks ago, Mr. Rebello had personally assured me that he was to the Parti Québécois to stay there and that his sovereignist convictions primar above all," said Pauline Marois, recalling that he even confronted A minister during the question period of 9 December 2011 by affirming him to have convictions. 
Pauline Marois has been deeply disappointed with the departure of the deputy of the Prairie who has chosen to join a party that has renounced Quebec a country. "François Rebello acts in pure opportunism. In politics, the franchise always has its place and the lie never pays, "concluded the chief, asking how Mr. Rebello can now combine his convictions with those of federalists who gave up defending Quebec.
