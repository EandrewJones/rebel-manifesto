The Leader of the Partician Party, Pauline Marois, wants to review the departure benefits received by members who do not complete the mandate for which they have got the confidence of their constituents. 
"When choosing to be a candidate for an election, it is done with the taste to serve his citizens, to devote himself for them. Abandon them along the way, for motifs very often questionable, it is not honor to his commitment. It is therefore necessary to establish the following principle: an elected representative who will abandon the mandate that his fellow citizens have entrusted to him will not receive compensation, "said Pauline Marois. The possibility that penalties are imposed on the pension plan in the event of departure during the mandate should also be examined. 
"It's no longer time to say," That's always how it happened ". We must hear Quebeckers and change, "added the leader of the Parti Québécois, stressing that taxpayers consider inconceivable that premiums of several thousand dollars are paid to ministers or deputies who resign four or six months after a general election. For example, she recalled the agreement with Chief Jean Charest and the former Monique Jerome-Forget Minister. The latter left in April 2009, only four months after being elected. 
Each resignation represents a huge cost for Québec taxpayers because it causes a partial election. Since the last general election in December 2008, it is estimated between $ 4.5 and $ 5 million the cost for the holding of nine partial elections. 
To make such a turn, a legislative amendment to the National Assembly Act is necessary. "It is tradition that this kind of change is unanimous parties. I therefore bring together the leaders of all other political courses to decide on this principle right now, "concluded Pauline Marois.
