Quebec- The member for Saint-Jérôme and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, arrested the government again about the removal of the people accommodated at the Pavilion Sainte-Marie, in the riding of Saint-Jérôme. On March 2, the 63 heavily disabled people who stay there learned that they would be torn from their living environment and relocated within 15 days. 
"These people live in the Sainte-Marie Pavilion for 10, 15, or even 20 years. Professionals, nurses, taking care of it on a daily basis are somehow becoming a second family. Thanks to the mobilization of families of households and the users' committee, the move was postponed to April 15th. But a question remains: why is this move in the precipitation, a precipitation similar to indignity? Asked Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"The pavilion is certainly obsolete, hence the will of all governments for three years to provide heavily disabled people who live there a living environment better suited to their needs. However, with a very short notice, the government is now preparing to destabilize and weaken people who are already excessively vulnerable. The Prime Minister must undertake to stay at that decision which, obviously, is greatly rushed, "concluded the hon. Member for Saint-Jérôme.
