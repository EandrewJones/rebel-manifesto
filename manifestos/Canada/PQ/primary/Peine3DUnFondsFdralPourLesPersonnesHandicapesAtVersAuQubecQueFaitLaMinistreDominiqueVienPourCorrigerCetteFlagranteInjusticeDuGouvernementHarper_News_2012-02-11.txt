Quebec- The member for Saint-Hyacinthe and official opposition spokesperson for persons with disabilities, Emilien Pelletier, is increasing that less than 3% of the federal government's accessibility fund has been used for people with disabilities of Quebec since 2008. 
"It is appalling to see the Conservative government drop people with disabilities and the rights organizations of Quebec in this way. The needs are just as great in Quebec as elsewhere. Why did the Minister Delegate to Social Services, Dominique Vien did nothing to correct this injustice? Currently, people with disabilities are the costs of this nonchalance, "said Emilien Pelletier. 
The hon. Member is seriously questioning the distribution of this fund when it is learned that on the $ 67 million available, 85% of the amounts were paid in constituencies represented by Conservative members. "It's totally undecided to see how the Stephen Harper federal government makes partisanship on the back of people with disabilities," he added. 
The Parti Québécois emphasizes that people with disabilities and rights defense groups have some glaring needs. "People with disabilities in Quebec have the right, too, to receive their fair share of federal funds. It is more time than the minister comes to intervene for this federal envelope to be managed in Quebec. We must facilitate the daily life of our people with disabilities who face serious accessibility problems, "concluded Emilien Pelletier.
