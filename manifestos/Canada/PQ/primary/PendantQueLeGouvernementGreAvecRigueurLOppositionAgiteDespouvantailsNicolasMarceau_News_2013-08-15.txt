Montreal- "Our government is dedicated to the growth of the economy and the sound management of public finances, unlike Philippe Couillard, which prefers to agitate scarecrows. Alarmist and liberal anxieties do not deceive anyone: everyone remembers that the Liberals inflated Quebec's debt from nearly one-third and plunged Quebec deficit, "said Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau. 
The economic and financial situation of Quebec is advantageously comparable to that of its neighbors. "While the Federal and Ontario governments face very important deficits, Quebec will return to a balanced budget this year. With regard to the control of expenditure, our government has delivered the goods, with a growth of 1.7% in 2012-2013, the best performance of the last fifteen years, even if the Liberal government spent without counting On the eve of the elections, "added the minister. 
The latest employment data demonstrate that Quebec has 70,000 more jobs since the beginning of the year, compared to the same period in 2012. Employment growth in Quebec (1.8%) is higher in that of Ontario (1.4%), Canada (1.4%) and the United States (1.6%). "It demonstrates that the strategy we have established works: stimulate private investment to ensure the prosperity of all regions," said the minister. 
He noted that the GDP growth forecast published by the Ministry of Finance and the Economy last March amounts to 1.3%. The most recent private sector forecasts confirm this data: Desjardins provides for a growth of 1.3%, while the Conference Board of Canada and RBC expected to 1.4%. 
"Liberal anguish pushes Mr. Bachand to make desolate shortcuts in his analysis of the economic situation of Quebec. On our side, we maintain the Cape Town on Budget Balance for 2013-2014, "concluded Mr. Marceau.
