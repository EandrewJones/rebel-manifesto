Quebec-the member for Saint-Hyacinthe and official opposition spokesperson for persons with disabilities, Emilien Pelletier, is worried about the data reported by the grouping of activists for inclusion in Quebec (Rapleq) who estimates 60% The number of public places inaccessible to people with reduced mobility. 
"It's quite unthinkable that as many public places are not accessible to people with reduced mobility. Whenever a disabled person is dismissed from these public places, it becomes discriminatory and we can not let things go well, "sorry Emilien Pelletier. 
The official opposition spokesperson for people with disabilities recalls that the release of the Rapliq is part of the same approach as Siena while on June 9 he asked the Minister from this to the National Assembly. "The problems experienced by people with disabilities are far from trivial. In this case, a 72-year-old lady with severe osteoporosis could not safely access her medical clinic, which is not suitable for people with reduced mobility. This is unacceptable! "," Said the member. 
"True to his habit, Minister Vien was content to answer the question vaguely without really taking into consideration the case of this lady. The time has come to speech to acts and allow real access to public places for people with disabilities. The social exclusion of persons with disabilities is unacceptable regardless of the form and I ask the minister to take all the interventions of the rights of the rights of these persons, "concluded the member Emilien Pelletier.
