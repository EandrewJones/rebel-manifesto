Quebec- In the light of the figures on employment in Quebec, published today, the member for Saint-Jean and spokesperson for the official opposition in terms of employment, vocational training, literacy and youth , Dave Turcotte, and the hon. Member for Saint-Jérôme and spokesperson for economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, find that the alleged Liberal effect on the Quebec economy means the Loss of nearly 50,000 full-time jobs in two months. The statistics published also indicate an increase in the unemployment rate by 0.4%, which increased from 7.6 to 8%. 
"After Quebec lost 32,000 jobs in April, the liberal effect leads to the loss of 800 jobs in May. This stagnation of employment caches makes the loss of 26,700 full-time jobs for the last month. The assessment since the arrival of the PLQ power is hardly connected. Obviously, we find that the liberal promises of job creation do not materialize, "said Dave Turcotte. 
"Will the Liberals apply the same way to do that when we were in government, that is to say, the monthly job creation figures? Finally, the liberal effect, it's less jobs and less economic growth, "said the member for Saint-Jean. 
The Liberal budgetAnds a drop in 20% widespread tax credits for several sectors of the economy. The business community are worried about these improvised cuts, made without any consultation. 
"The Liberals cut and then think through their Quebec tax review board. In addition, the Liberal budget plan contains no clear vision of economic development. There are no structuring actions. I recall that the government has abandoned the measures included in the economic priority employed by the Parti Québécois, a policy, which has been welcomed by the business community, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
