"The Liberal Prime Minister is entangled in ethical problems, inertia, indecision and inconsistency. Meanwhile, Quebec's economic development is still losing. Employment is stagnating in Quebec. There are even fewer jobs right now that there were 11 months ago. Since the arrival of the Liberals two years ago, it has only been created 34,900 jobs. Only one-third of jobs promised election campaign, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"Again, in March, Quebec has lost jobs: 22,500 full-time, for a net loss of 11,200 jobs. Meanwhile, in the rest of Canada, it has created 57,800 full-time jobs. The promise of the 250,000 jobs has been disappeared since the last budget of the Minister of Finance. The figure does not even appear in the budget documents. The Prime Minister and his dismantled economic trio lied to Quebecers, "added Nicolas Marceau. 
"The lack of economic policy will undermine the development of Quebec and our regions. It is time for the Prime Minister noticing. We have seen, yesterday, at the announcement on energy policy: there are many promises and goals, but few ways, not counting the uncertainty in which entrepreneurs and SMEs of Quebec are plunged . It is time for the government to be disgusted with its problems and acts, "says Alain Therien. 
"Liberal austerity, in addition to cutting the services to the population and families of Quebec, undermines the economy and employment. Workers are waiting for unclear means and gestures. Quebec's economy needs a real policy now! ", Concluded Dave Turcotte.
