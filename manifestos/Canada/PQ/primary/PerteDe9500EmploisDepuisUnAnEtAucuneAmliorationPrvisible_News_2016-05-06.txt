Quebec- The spokesman for the Parti Québécois in finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, the spokesperson for economy, energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, as well as the spokesperson for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, recall that the long-term trend is increasingly disturbing with respect to employment in Quebec. 
"From April 2015 to April 2016, he lost 9,500 jobs in Quebec. All economic indicators are down, as many signals that should react the government. On the contrary, Minister Angle introduced us to disparate strategic plans, without vision and without means. After two years of inaction, the Prime Minister finally recognizes the need to bring together all socio-economic partners around the design of a real economic policy to create jobs. He must summon this meeting as quickly as possible, "claimed the member for Rousseau. 
"According to Desjardins, by 2018, Quebec has created 121,000 jobs, half of the 250,000 that the Liberal government had promised election campaign. At first, 250,000 jobs, it was a promise. Then it became a target. Then, a goal and, finally, a myth. Today, it's a joke, "said the member for Sanguinet. 
"We had been promised jobs to Quebec families; The government has rather denied its promise and piges in their pocket to fill its lack of economic vision. It takes a business plan, and quickly, "concluded the hon. Member for Saint John.
