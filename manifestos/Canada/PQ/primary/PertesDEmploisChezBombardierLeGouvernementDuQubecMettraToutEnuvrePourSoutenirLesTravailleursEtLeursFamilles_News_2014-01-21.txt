The Quebec aerospace sector is strong and will provide employment opportunities in the future. » 
The minister noted that the recent announcement of the postponement of the entry into service of the two models of Cseries, that of the CS100 being repulsed at the second half of 2015 and that of the CS300, at six months later, and the financial consequences which are connected to it explain the decision of the company. 
"Nevertheless, remain positive. Cleries aircraft are high quality products whose sales prospects are very encouraging. At full rate of production, the manufacture of the two CSeries models will work 3,500 people in Quebec, not to mention the important spin-offs in several suppliers. It is therefore very likely that part of the laid off today will be recalled, in addition to those who can be reallocated to other functions within the company, "said the minister. 
The Minister has remembered that employees who will lose their work can benefit from some government programs to support them and assist them in their job search.
