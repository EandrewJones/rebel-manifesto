Quebec- The member for Berthier and official opposition spokesperson for agriculture, fisheries and food, André Villeneuve, the member for Gaspé, Gaétan Lelièvre, and the hon. Member for Bonaventure, Sylvain Roy, denounce the Liberal government cuts, which force the Aquaculture and Merinov Fisheries Innovation Center to fire 50 employees. 
Indeed, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has still not paid the $ 800,000 needed for the operation of Merinov. However, the expertise of this center is essential for the survival of fisheries and aquaculture in Quebec. 
"The abandonment of Merinov by the government will have direct consequences for the fisheries industry, a nerve economic sector for the regions of the Gaspé-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Bas-Saint-Laurent and the coast. -North. Fifty researchers and technicians will meet again on February 6th if the government does not go back. In short, Minister Pierre Paradis must immediately unlock the necessary funds to prevent these workers from losing their employment, "said André Villeneuve. 
This new episode confirms the thesis that the Liberal government has completely abandoned the regions of Quebec. "With this new cut, the Liberals are pursuing their series of direct attacks towards the regions. These 50 lost jobs are added to the hundreds of others that will result from measures such as the abolition of Crés, CLDs, or the change of mission of youth cross-employment. The government needs to stop at the regions! "Pursued Gaétan Lelièvre. 
Not later than last week, the Regional Minister Jean d'Amour insured that the government would support Merinov. "Jean d'Amour has deceived the population by promising the financial support of the government. It is seen today: money is not at the rendezvous. There are limits to go great statements, while we do not book the goods! "Sylvain Roy concluded.
