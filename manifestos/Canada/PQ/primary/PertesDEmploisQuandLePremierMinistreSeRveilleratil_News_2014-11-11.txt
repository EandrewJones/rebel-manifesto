Quebec- The member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, once again asked Prime Minister Philippe Couillard to quickly file a recovery plan for employment in Quebec. Remember that in October only, 30,000 full-time jobs were lost; If we take stock from the arrival of the Liberal Party in power, Quebec has 82,000 less jobs. 
While the Prime Minister admits his poor performance, his Minister of Finance announces that he will not do anything to stimulate employment in its economic and financial update. "It is incredible to hear the Minister of Finance say that the economy is accelerating, while banks revise down their growth forecasts. Liberal austerity has installed mistrust everywhere. The government suggests uncertainty about economic programs and tax measures since June, so our entrepreneurs do not dare any hiring; They are waiting for stability. This is the liberal effect: a record of mediocrity in employment. The Prime Minister speaks only one thing: his North Plan. However, metal prices are down. In addition, the North Plan will not create jobs before several years. But it is now that we need a recovery of employment! Stéphane Bédard said. 
A real job recovery plan 
"There are four weeks left at the parliamentary session; The Prime Minister must put an end to his inexplicable stubbornness to do nothing before the collapse of the labor market. Does the economic update that the government should present soon will only contain increases in tariffs and other tax cuts to businesses, or will the Prime Minister finally introduce us a real employment recovery plan ? ", Concluded the leader of the official opposition.
