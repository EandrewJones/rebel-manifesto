Quebec- The spokesperson for the Quebec's forest party, Sylvain Roy, is sorry for the attitude of the Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, Laurent Lessard, while 148 Tembec workers will lose their job next Monday, Due to the announced closure of the Senneterre plant. 
Following ministerial reshuffle, Laurent Lessard told the Journalla Tribune last Saturday that he would have welcomed a promotion with pleasure. "The minister lacks respect for workers. He should be concerned about lost jobs rather than his own situation. In Senneterre, there are 148 families who will soon have to deal with a difficult financial situation, and Laurent Lessard thinks of the promotion that he might have had, "lamented Sylvain Roy. 
The situation is more than distressing. In all regions of Quebec, since the arrival of the minister, thousands of jobs have been lost, in the forest as much as in the factory. "The industry and forest workers are still waiting for Minister Lessard to act to protect jobs. How many other factory closures have to move? Its lack of vision is expensive for the forest industry. Before thinking of a new position, he should seriously consider the difficulties of workers in the region, "said the hon. Member for Bonaventure.
