"It's nothing, we are talking about a financing activity organized by engineers involved in a well-known member of the Montreal Mafia and important actors of a firm that negotiated at the time with the Ministry of which Line Beauchamp. was the holder. Our questions are legitimate and for a week we have been replying anything by this government, "said Bertrand St-Arnaud. 
The member submitted a second question, this time this time to another funding activity organized for the former Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau. "Nathalie Normandeau has itself admitted that an engineering firm had organized a financing activity for it. And the Liberal Party None of this seems to be a problem, "added the deputy parliamentary leader. 
"The questions that arise in relation to these activities are numerous. That's why we decided to use a maximum of ways to get answers. Nobody seems to be inclined in this government to shed light on these activities. It's grotesque! , Added the member for Chambly.
