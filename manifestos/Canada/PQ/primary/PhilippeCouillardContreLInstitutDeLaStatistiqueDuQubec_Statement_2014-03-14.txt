The Quebec Institute of Statistics has made public this week, as it does every year at this time, Donnes on Employment for 2013. This is what it says: 
However, in a false advertisement broadcast by the Liberal Party, Philippe Couillard tries to make Quebec people believe that employment goes wrong, while it knows it's all the opposite. Net job creation, increased full-time work, decrease in unemployment, increase in hourly wage; All aspects of employment have progressed in 2013 thanks, including, in particular, to the action of our government. 
But since this excellent news for Quebec workers does not correspond to his alarmist message, the Liberal leader decides to attack the messenger, the Quebec Institute of Statistics, accusing him of obscurantism! 
The truth is simple: to land in Saviors and to serve their partisan purposes, the Liberals would prefer that employment in Quebec goes wrong and that unemployment increases. Unfortunately for them, the economic team of the Quebecois has done a great job and we are on the right track. 
In the evaluation of the employment situation, Raymond Bachand and Jean Charest also used the ISQ data, a neutral organism and recognized for his expertise; Philippe Couillard has even recognized that it would not change the methods of calculating the ISQ if elected. 
The Liberals use, in their advertising and the images they share on social networks, erroneous data. Framing Quebeckers, leaving to lie, is part of their country plan. This misinformation is harmful, for both Quebec and for the image it projects from Quebeckers. 
By accusing the ISQ to create darkness, Philippe Couillard also appares the image of a large Quebec institution. It is called a man aspiring to become Prime Minister of Quebec. 
Definitely, when we do not share Mr. Couillard's views, the insults arrive quickly.
