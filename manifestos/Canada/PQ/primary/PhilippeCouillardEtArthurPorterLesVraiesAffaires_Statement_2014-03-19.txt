Tuesday, in an article of the daily duty, "Wearing Hanter Couillard". It is learned that Arthur wearing "acted in illegality in 2010 based on a company with the former Minister of Health. [...] Wear, Couillard and Associates was founded 17 months before Arthur Porter was forced to resign in December 2011, four months before the end of his mandate at the head of the MUHC. " 
Hello by the media about it, Philippe Couillard lost patience and won, "I have full back! " He argued that he had not met the Dr. Wear after the appointment of it at the head of the MUHC in 2004. 
So, Philippe Couillard still contradicts since, from his very mouth, he would have done by Arthur wearing in 2003 and would be very good friends! 
After the nine years of ethical bankruptcy of the Liberal government, Quebeckers deserve better than the flip-flops, the philippe-flops, the lies and the avoidance of Philippe Couillard. It's time for the Liberal Party leader to make all the light on its links with Arthur Porter. 
This is what Robert Dutrisac is in a duty of the morning: "became the target, Couillad out of his hinges" 
Rather than claiming that "nothing has changed in Quebec in 18 months," Philippe Couillard should look in his own court. 
Since his election in September 2012, the Government of the Parti Québécois, led by Pauline Marois, has worked for more integrity, prosperity, solidarity and defense of our identity in Quebec. And we have delivered the goods. 
Where nothing has changed, it's the Liberal Party.
