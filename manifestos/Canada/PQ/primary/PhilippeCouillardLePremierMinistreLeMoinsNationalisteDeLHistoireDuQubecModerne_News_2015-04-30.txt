Quebec- The hon. Member for Chicoutimi and Official Opposition Leader, Stéphane Bédard, asked Prime Minister Philippe Couillard to fulfill his duty, to protect the interests of Quebecers against the federal government. 
"Philippe Couillard has taken a step that no prime minister had done before him: he totally handed the advocacy of Quebec in the hands of Quebec federal deputies. I remind him that his role is precisely to defend our interests in the face of the unilateral decisions of the federal government, which penalize Quebec. Can someone wake him up? The Prime Minister of Quebec is Canadian first, Canadian at all costs, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
In the temporary foreign workers' file, for example, the Leader of the Official Opposition recalls that the federal measures, which come into force today, renounces an agreement signed with Quebec. In addition, they will have significant economic impacts. The representatives of the companies unanimously decried the administrative heaviness imposed on them by the federal government. As for the Liberal government, it has never considered it good to document the actual effects of these measures on the economy of Quebec. 
In addition, yesterday, the Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, confirmed that because of the changes made to TFSA and FERR in the last federal budget, Quebec would lose $ 100 million a year. 
"This loss of income will obviously have to be overwhelmed by Quebeckers, who will be imposed on new cuts. This is how the liberal resignation continues against Ottawa. Before, Quebec affirmed its positions; From now on, we have a government that no longer leads any battle, a government that systematically abdicates. Ottawa says No, Quebec crashes! "Concluded Stéphane Bédard.
