Quebec, November 21, 2017 -The official finance opposition spokesperson, Nicolas Marceau, denounces the Liberal ploy that was to deprive Quebec of essential services, under the pretext that "it was necessary", then to applaud because it is now the time to redistribute, in the form of electoral candies, the money taken to taxpayers, patients and students. 
IN SHORT 
"We have just attended the triggering of the liberal election campaign. The tax cuts announced today were paid by taxpayers and drastic sections of the last three years in services. The PLQ has neglected patients, students and seniors in order to finance his 2018 elections, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
"The reinvestments announced in public services are not comparable to what has been cut in recent years. Children who have been deprived of the professionals they needed throughout this time will hardly catch up; These students have been sacrificed. The misery in which our elders were left, as shown by the Protector of the Citizen, will not be cleared by clearly insufficient reinvestments. When we asked the Prime Minister why he had coupe so much, he told us that "it was necessary". We understand today that it was necessary only for its re-election plan, "added the spokesman. 
"Philippe Couillard takes Quebeckers for idiots by imagining that they still trust the one who dropped their children and their parents for an electoral check of $ 278. Same thing when it fails to tell them that with the little one is announced today for health, there will always be more money to increase the salary of doctors than for the development of patient care. We sincerely believe that the population is able to understand the liberal maneuvers and that it will remember the time. At that moment, the Parti Québécois will be there to repair the damage caused by the Liberals, "concluded Nicolas Marceau.
