Quebec- The member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, and the member for Verchères and Spokespersons in Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, ask the Prime Minister to act concretely in order to assert Interest of Quebec against the federal government. 
"Philippe Couillard was wrong for the tribune; It is in Ottawa that he must go. In Queen's Park, he claims that Canada should one day recognize Quebec's specificity, but for a year, for a year, to make it valid? It is beautiful to address the Ontario Parliament, but what about concrete actions with Ottawa? Take the files of the application of Law 101 to federally chartered companies and the firearms register; Even before making requests, the government abdicated. Indeed, it will not claim compensation for the destruction of the data. Obviously, Philippe Couillard prefers from afar to families and regions of Quebec rather than claiming their fair share against Ottawa, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
The Leader of the Official Opposition also recalls that last August, the Ontario Prime Minister Kathleen Wynne said that Quebec's place in Canada was not on the radar screen. 
Stéphane Bergeron died the Prime Minister for the very short and shy list of applications he presented in Ottawa in anticipation of the next federal elections. "The prime minister's list is clearly insufficient. Philippe Couillard has even fewer requests than Jean Charest, who had listed a dozen at the 2008 federal election. Quebec is totally ignored in several files, including those of the toll on the Champlain Bridge, from the part which should him Return for vessel construction contracts, and the imposition of a pan-Canadian securities commission. The list is long; The Prime Minister must go beyond words and finally take his responsibilities, "he added.
