Québec- As the Economic Update of the Liberal Government approaches, the member for Saint-Jérôme and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, denounces the Prime Minister's intention to increase the TVQ from this autumn. 
"The Liberal Prime Minister refused to answer my questions and close the door to an increase in the QST. However, eight associations representing the retail sector in Quebec warn the government against the devastating effects of a third increase in the QST in five years. According to them, some 480,000 jobs could be affected by this decision. The first two increases resulted in sales growth twice as low as the other years. What does the Prime Minister respond to retailers' associations that represent these 480,000 workers? Asked Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"While Quebec already has the highest sales tax in North America, the government is unable to clarify how it intends to address, in full explosion, related to cross-border e-commerce. In 2012, Quebec was already losing half a billion tax revenue because of this practice. In 2015, this amount is certainly much higher, since Internet sales increased by more than 10% per year and, often, no tax is charged. The border services agency does nothing, Canada Post does not do anything, and the Quebec government does not control Customs or the positions, nor the banks that issue credit cards used for payments. While he intends to raise the TVQ, what will the government do to stem these problems? , "Added the leader of the official opposition.
