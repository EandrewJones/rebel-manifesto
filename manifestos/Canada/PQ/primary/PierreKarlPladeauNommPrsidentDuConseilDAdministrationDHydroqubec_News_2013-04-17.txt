The Council of Ministers of the Marois Government has today made the appointment of Mr. Pierre Karl Péladeau as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Hydro-Québec. He will enter office on May 15, 2013. 
Pauline Marois asked one of Quebec's great entrepreneurs to take the lead of one of our most important Crown corporations. His jurisdiction does not doubt: his experience, his expertise, his sense of business will be able to benefit all Quebec. 
Mr. Péladeau has agreed to give his time and share his expertise without pay. We salute this gesture. He also committed to withdraw from any meeting of the Board of Directors if questions related to Québecor are raised. 
Hydro-Québec is a jewel that belongs to all Quebeckers; An entrepreneur at the head of his board of directors will be beneficial for all Quebec.
