Quebec- The hon. Member for Saint-Jérôme and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, wanted to pay tribute to Gilles Duceppe, following the announcement of his departure. 
"Gilles Duceppe is a man of convictions. Throughout his career, he defended the interests of Quebecers and Quebeckers on the federal scene with passion and rigor. Over the month, since my arrival in politics, I was able to appreciate the depth, experience and intellectual honesty of Gilles, qualities that allowed us to link a beautiful friendship. Quebec owes him a lot, just like the independence movement. His contribution to our project is invaluable, and I know he will continue to serve the cause. We can only be grateful to him for all his commitment to Quebec. Thank you, Gilles! Pierre Karl Péladeau said. 
"In June 2015, Gilles took a courageous decision, that of coming back as head of the Bloc Québécois. He has led a very nice election campaign and has demonstrated all his knowledge of Quebec binding issues to the federal government. He mobilized around him a team of identified candidates, composed of many young people from the independence succession. I wish him a serene return to his wife, Yolande, and his family, "concluded the head of the official opposition.
