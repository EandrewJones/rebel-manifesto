Quebec, on February 15, 2017- Nicole Léger, spokesman for the Treasury Board, deplores that the President of the Treasury Board, Pierre Moreau, still failed to resolve the labor dispute that his government does Putting with the lawyers of the state, and that his colleague Minister of Justice, Stephanie Vallée, is drowned his hands. 
"The lawyers believed Pierre Moreau when he said that resolving this conflict was his priority and that of his Prime Minister. He has rather invented the climate yesterday. It is becoming increasingly clear that the government is engaged in a strategy for the exhaustion of the strikers rather than in a good faith negotiation, "has exposed Léger Nicole. 
"The Quebecois Party again asks Pierre Moreau to publicly deposit the offers that the government has made to state lawyers. People want to know if the minister's claims are accurate; They want the confirmation that the offers made to lawyers and notaries of the state are the same as those subject to prosecutors of criminal and criminal prosecutions, "added the spokesman. 
Nicole Léger is surprised, moreover, of the absence in the file of the Minister of Justice. "Where is Stéphanie Valley, again? What does it do to defend the rule of law, justice in Quebec? The state acts without legal compass. We have never seen a minister of justice abdicate as much responsibility. She dropped her lawyers, who are his rights in the governance of the state. She also and especially dropped Quebeckers, those who are in court and waiting to settle their cause. More than 3000 folders are delayed because of this strike! Yesterday, the Bar once again urged it to consider the fundamental role of state lawyers in the smooth running of legislative activities. Where is she? She asked.
