Québec, August 29, 2016 -The Member of Berthier and spokesman for the Parti Québécois in agriculture, André Villeneuve, is reflecting the widespread rise in the property taxes that the farmers would suffer from 2017, a consequence of the reform of the Agricultural land tax credit (PCTFA). Because, unlike the affirmations of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Paradis, 83% of agricultural producers will receive their tax account increase. 
"Minister Paradis has misleaded farmers, claiming that changes to the PCTFA would be at zero cost. The analysis produced by its department is clear: under the new program, 83% of Quebec's agricultural producers will pay more taxes. Some of them will have to pay extra money up to thousands of dollars! In total, it is millions that the Liberal government will cheap Pigron in the pockets of our producers, "denounced André Villeneuve. 
Remember that during the study of credits last April, the minister had tried the legitimate concerns aroused by the reform of the PCTFA. "Pierre Paradis has tried to Berner the farmers. Without the questions posed by the Parti Québécois, they would have had a bad surprise by receiving their tax account. Now the minister must recognize his wrongs and cancel his unfair and abusive reform, "concluded the member for Berthier.
