Qu√©bec - "Minister James' announcement today for the development of 15,000 new subsidized child care places feels not only the full-nose warming, but constitutes a lure: these places will not be available before five years . It is a confirmation that the liberal commitment will not be respected ". 
That said the hon. Member for Iberville and sentence of the official opposition in family, Marie Bouille, who believes that Minister Yoland James tries to make believe that the Liberal government is in action while The development of child care places has been stagnating for several years. 
In the budget presented in March 2011 by the Minister of Finance, Raymond Bachand, the Minister stated in the annexes that the 15,000 places promised during the 2008 election campaign will not be delivered before 2016. "Or it is Minister Bachand Or it's Minister James, but one of them does not tell us the truth. In the meantime, it is the parents who pay the price, they who are waiting for places in a shouting and urgent way in many cases, "Marie Bouille continued. 
The hon. Member also recalls that in 2007 the Liberal government undertook to create 18,000 places by March 2011. However, from these promised places, another 4300 places were not created. "By emphasizing the 15,000 places that must be created, the minister seems to forget that it still has 4300 of the previous commitment. In short, the delay accumulates and development is done in the dropper, "illustrates the spokesperson. 
She did not fail to point out that in the aftermath of the discourse on the budget, Minister James published a statement in which she claimed that the creation of 15,000 places, "Let's go! , According to his expression. "She uses the same expression still today in her press release! Yet nothing has changed. All this is only powder in the eyes. What parents want is action, not political marketing, "concluded Marie Bouille.
