Quebec- The member for Marie-Victorin and the official opposition on energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, and the member for Jonquière and spokesperson for sustainable development and environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, find that the Liberal government reopens the shale gas sector in Catimini, hiding behind a new environmental study. 
The best sign that the Liberals are willing to do so, it is their refusal to discuss this week of a motion claiming that the Government tables again the Program of Law 37, which would impose a moratorium on exploration and the Exploitation of shale gas. 
"Even if we add a strategic environmental assessment (EAS) to the two public hearings on the environment and to the EAS that has already taken place, there will be no more social acceptability for shale gas. The population of the St. Lawrence Valley does not want it. There is a multiplication of studies in the hope of changing the popular perception, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
Otherwise, the Liberal Plan today reveals what the Quebecois party had made to correct Charest government's mistakes. "The Liberals are pursuing our management for Anticosti, Old Harry, Enbridge, and the Drinking Water Regulations. For Anticosti, for example, they had let the licenses go for a bite of bread. With the government of the Parti Québécois, the population had resumed its rights on Anticosti, "said Bernard Drainville.
