MONTREAL- The member for Vachon and spokesperson for the official opposition on shale mines and gas, Martine Ouellet, finds that the apprehensions of the Quebecois party on the marketing plan in northern Jean Charest are shared by employees of The state, according to information published by the daily Le Devoir, Saturday, January 28th. 
In an internal document, the Public Service Union of Quebec denounces the Liberal government's laxism that does nothing for the state to have the staff required to ensure sustainable development of projects that could eventually hatch the North Plan . "Everything is in place for the open bar to maintain and that companies benefit without paying to Quebecers their fair share because the Charest government refuses to make responsible economic development," Martine Ouellet. 
The Parti Québécois has tried, without success, to adopt an amendment to bill 14 on the mines so that the Government is obliged to make public, each year, the extracted tonnage, the charges perceived and the net worth withdrawn resources. "The refusal of the Liberals and Minister Serge Simard is inadmissible. Quebeckers have the right to know what comes out of their subsoil, "continued Martine Ouellet. 
In addition, the member for Vachon corroborates the information that the expertise is rare on the ground. "In the Parliamentary Committee last spring, we learned that there are only three full-time inspectors to monitor all mines in Quebec! With the extent of our territory and the current mining boom, this situation is laughable, "she added. 
"State expertise should be strengthened for sustainable mining development so as not to relive a situation as at the Quebec Ministry of Transportation where the privately took the keys to the ministry," concluded Martine Ouellet.
