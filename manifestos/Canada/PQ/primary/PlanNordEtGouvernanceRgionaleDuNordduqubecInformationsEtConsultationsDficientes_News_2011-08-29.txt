Chibougamau -After many comments heard from its fellow citizens during the summer period and after a regional tour of Nord-du-Québec, the member for UNGAVA and sentence of the official opposition in respect of Nordic development, Luc Ferland, concludes that there are serious gaps in the transmission of information about the North Plan in the region. 
"Beyond the announcements by Prime Minister Jean Charest concerning some infrastructure projects and promotional tours outside Quebec, very little regional information has allowed citizens to get a clear idea of what this North Plan represents for The North-du-Québec region. Let's be clear: it is not normal for a project of this scope remains unknown for residents of the main region concerned, "said Luc Ferland. 
Several questions remain unanswered. "What happens to the announcement of the subtraction of 50% of the territory to any industrial activity? The law creating society from the Nord Plan should be voted this fall, we still have no idea that will represent us and what proportion? Where will the head office and the main officers be located? In the north or in the south? ", Wonders the member for Ungava. 
Remember that a new governance of the James Bay Territory was announced last May between the Cree, Jamesians and the Government of Quebec. On this occasion, the partners set a period of 12 months to arrive at a negotiated settlement. In this regard, the member is concerned about the lack of information provided for the progress of this transaction. 
"I firmly intend to make sure that specific information tours are organized in our region. The government has the duty to meet, in the first place, the people directly concerned by projects of this nature, especially when we know that they will inevitably have impacts on our future, "concluded Luc Ferland.
