Quebec- The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the Territory, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, is pleased to announce that Quebeckers' owners of a vehicle will soon be able to get personalized license plates . He made the announcement this afternoon, in the presence of the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Québec Automobile Insurance Society, Ms. Nathalie Tremblay. 
"This new product responds to requests expressed over the years by many vehicle owners. The personalized plate will be offered from September 2015 for walker vehicles and motorcycles, "said Minister Gaudreault. 
This product is already offered by almost all Canadian administrations and in all US states. Quebec vehicle owners will also have the opportunity to choose a combination of particular letters or numbers. This combination should be up to seven characters.
