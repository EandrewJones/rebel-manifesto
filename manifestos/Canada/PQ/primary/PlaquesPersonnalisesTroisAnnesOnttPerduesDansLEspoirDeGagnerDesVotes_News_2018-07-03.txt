The form-spokesman of the official finance opposition, Nicolas Marceau, the spokesperson for transport, Martin Ouellet, and the former Minister of Transport of the Parti Québécois, Sylvain Gaudreault, deplore that the Liberal government has established For three years before allowing custom license plates. 
IN SHORT 
Minister of Transport within the Quebec Party Government, Sylvain Gaudreault remembers: "We announced that in the fall of 2015, Quebec would allow custom license plates. Almost three years later, after hesitating, procrastinated and louvoye, the Liberals finally announce that the program will be put in place. Surprisingly, this announcement takes place three months before the election; It's still amazing! The government must explain to us why it has long made Quebeckers so long, except to take advantage of the pre-election context, "he exposed. 
"It was during the study of Bill 150, the Government's Financial Omnibus, which we learned that the Liberals had decided to reduce this proposal to the table. What a surprise! However, flying-face, the Liberals have earlier remove the disposition for custom plates. It is thanks to our vigilance it has been brought back. In short, the government will announce it today, but people are not fooled: they know that these three years of waiting are the result of the liberal calculation, "continued Nicolas Marceau. 
"Of course, as the late announcement of the Liberals is practically copied to the one that the Parti Québécois had made, we welcome him positively. There are many years already that vehicle owners demand such a possibility. It was more than time that Quebec follows suit from the rest of North America! ", Concluded Martin Ouellet.
