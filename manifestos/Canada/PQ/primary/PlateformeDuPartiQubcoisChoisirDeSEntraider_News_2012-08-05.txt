Montreal- The Electoral Platform of the Parti Québécois comes in three parts: assert itself, enrich themselves and help each other. "We need to help us," said the leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois. The way we take care of our world is a distinctive trait of Quebecers. From the barn burned at the neighbor that must be rebuilt at the emergency deployed during the Saguenay and Grand Verglas flood, we have proven that we are stronger when we help ourselves. We have adopted innovative social policies, some of which serve as models around the world. We have created a model of social dialogue that made Quebec one of the most peaceful companies in the world. Our graduation rate has made everyday progression through a generous policy of accessibility for studies, but with the Liberals, people are worried. Quebeckers must be assured that their government will do everything they need to grow old at home, surrounded by their loved ones. We believe that a people worthy encourages his youth and takes care of his elders. We are going to take care of our world, from all Quebeckers! »
