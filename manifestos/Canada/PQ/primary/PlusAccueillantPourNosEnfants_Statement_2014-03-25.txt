For the Québécois party as for me, take care of Quebec children and support their parents, it has always been priorities. This has given great public policies that have changed the social and economic face of Quebec. 
When my government came into office, we took over the work where the Liberals had abandoned him. Upon arrival, we have granted 13,000 new day care for projects that were waiting for several months. 
Today, the Parti Québécois undertakes that the custody network is completed during the next mandate, in 2016. We will create 15,000 new places, for a total of 28,000. 
In 2017, when they were all implanted, there will be 250,000 childcare places in Quebec, one for each child. 
I also announce to you that from next 1stuin, parents will be able to register their child at a one-stop shop for a place in care. 
However, we want to go even further. 
We want to open a new building site, that of work-family-study conciliation. Give parents a little boost for them to spend more time with their child, to make life easier. I announce the upcoming hold of a great forum on work-family-study conciliation. On this occasion, we will reflect on solutions to improve the quality of life of Quebec families. 
I also want us to look at the issue of transport. For all families, the time spent on the move, it is less time spent together, to take care of each other, to prepare for good meals or to do physical activity. 
In this campaign, the only party that takes firm commitments and has a plan to improve the lives of families, it is the Parti Québécois. 
It is therefore the choice that is offered to Quebecers for the next election: do they come back to the liberal years, during which our public services have declined? Or do they want a government that takes care of Quebeckers and who creates jobs and custody services? 
At the Québécois party, we are determined to build a more welcoming Quebec for our children.
