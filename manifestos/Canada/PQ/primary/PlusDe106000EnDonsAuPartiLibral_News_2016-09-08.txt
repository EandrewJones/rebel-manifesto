Quebec, September 8, 2016 -The MP for Taschereau and spokesperson for the Quebecois and Integrity Party, Agnès Maltais, remains unsatisfied with the answers provided by Laurent Lessard and Philippe Couillard with respect to the conflict of interest in which the first is plunged since this morning. 
"We first read the Lessard case, which is followed by: Pyrobiom Energies inc., The Yvon Nadeau's forest company, a former political attaché of the Minister of Forests at the time, Laurent Lessard, a benefited from the maximum permissible grant of $ 3 million from the Technoclimat program. We now reveal that since 2000, the directors of the company Pyrobiom Energies inc., And other related companies, have collectively contributed to the Liberal Party for $ 106,150, "said the member for Taschereau. 
"The revelations of this morning already commited many questions about the grant of $ 3 million to Pyrobiom Energies inc. Yet the Couillard Prime Minister does not seem to have trouble troubled - neither interested, moreover - by the doubts that weigh on his new Minister of Transport. Now, with these new revelations about the liberal donors appearing in the file, we discover the magnitude of the presence of the liberal sector in this case. We are talking about more than $ 100,000 collected from the relevant directors who went to the Liberal Party Caisse! , "Added the spokesman. 
"The more we dig the Lessard case, the more questions about the integrity of the Liberal Party. Once again, Philippe Couillard fails an ethics test by sweeping the reverse of serious revelations on a minister of his government, "said Agnès Maltese.
