Quebec- The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, today announces a historic increase in eligibility thresholds for legal aid, which will give access to free legal aid to People working full-time minimum wage. This increase will also provide, from 1 next January, free coverage to seniors living alone and mainly benefiting from the guaranteed income supplement. 
The announcement was made to the National Assembly in the presence of the Quebec baton, Master Johanne Brodeur, Ad. E., and the President of the Committee on Legal Services, Mr. Denis Roy. 
"This substantial bonus of the Quebec legal aid regime is at the heart of the commitments of the Government of Quebec for more accessible justice, justice for all. With this historical enhancement of eligibility thresholds for legal aid, more than 500,000 additional people who will soon have access to the free component of this plan, "said the Minister of Justice. 
With this substantial rise, the Quebec government responds to the recommendations made over the years in many reports, and to the concerns expressed for decades by the Judiciary, the Barreau du Québec and several community-based groups. 
"For almost 30 years, a person working full-time at the minimum wage is not eligible for free legal aid. This is unacceptable and contrary to the spirit of the legal aid program introduced in 1973. It is also a considerable obstacle to the access of our fellow citizens to justice. We were committed to what it changes, and it will change, "added the Minister of Justice. 
The new regulation that will be published in the official Gazette du Québec next week will result in a period of one and a half years more than 30% of the free legal aid eligibility thresholds for a single person. This threshold will first move from $ 14,140 to $ 16,306 on January 1, 2014 - 15.3% increase - before being set on 1 June 2015 to the amount corresponding to the annual income of a person then working at Minimum wage at 35 hours a week. 
For a couple with two children, the free component thresholds will increase from $ 23,184 to $ 26,737 as of January 1, 2014, and then to more than $ 30,000 as at June 1, 2015. 
The costs of this bonus are, ultimately, nearly $ 17 million a year. They will be able to fluctuate according to the demands actually accepted. 
In addition, the important element, the eligibility threshold for legal aid will now be automatically adjusted according to the minimum wage, thus ensuring the definitive maintenance of accessibility to legal aid. 
It should be remembered that the legal aid targets the services provided for in the Legal Aid Act and the provision of certain other legal services. In particular, it may be granted for cases that fall under civil, family, administrative, criminal, mental health, immigration and youth law. 
"The Government of Quebec is a point of honor to administer justice with integrity, fairness and humanity. Today, I am proud to say that our justice system will be even more human, even more united, "concluded the Minister of Justice.
