Qu√©bec- The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, confirms that the Council of Ministers has adopted the Regulations with a historic increase in the eligibility thresholds for legal aid from 1 January 2014. 
As early as the next month, this increase will provide free coverage to seniors living alone and mainly benefiting from the guaranteed income supplement. Then, in June 2015, it will give access to free legal aid to people working full-time at the minimum wage. 
"With this substantial bonus of the Quebec legal aid regime, more than 500,000 additional people will soon have access to the free component of this plan. This increase will help make our justice system even more human and more solidarity, "said the Minister of Justice. 
For almost 30 years, a person working full-time minimum wage has not been eligible for free legal aid, which was contrary to the spirit of this program introduced in 1973. By correcting this situation, the government of the Quebec has come to meet the recommendations over the years in many reports as well as the concerns expressed for decades by the judiciary, the Quebec Bar and several community-based groups. 
Thus, between January 1, 2014 and June 1, 2015, the free legal aid eligibility threshold for a single person will increase by 30%. Currently set at $ 14,140, it will be adjusted at $ 16,306 as of January 1, 2014, 15.3% increase. As at June 1, 2015, it will be fixed to the amount corresponding to the annual income of a person working at the minimum wage at a rate of 35 hours per week, and then indexed annually. 
For a couple with two children, the free component thresholds will increase from $ 23,184 to $ 26,737 as of January 1, 2014, and then to more than $ 30,000 as at June 1, 2015. 
The costs of this bonus are, ultimately, nearly $ 17 million a year. They will be able to fluctuate according to the demands actually accepted. 
The increase in eligibility thresholds for legal aid is part of the government guidelines on which "solidarity" pillar restail, one of the four pillars of government action, with integrity, prosperity and identity. These guidelines, made public on October 30 by the Premier Pauline Marois, will guide the government's action in the implementation of measures aimed at improving the well-being of the most vulnerable individuals and families. The government wants to give a new impetus to solidarity, an inseparable value of collective wealth.
