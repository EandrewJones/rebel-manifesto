Québec- In the record of the health structures reform of Gaétan Barrette, Diane Lamarre, Member of Parliament for Quéilli Québécois in health and accessibility for care, deplores that patients are once again the big ones losers. It requires the Minister to make public a complete, clear and up-to-date portrait of the amounts that have been paid into severance pay for executives and for the management of the transition in institutions. 
"While the minister confirmed this fall that $ 38 million would be paid into severance pay to the 1051 health network executives who have shown the door in 2015-16, the total we determined using requests. Requests access to information is more than 70 million. And it is not to mention that the managers who are still stationary must dial with a double or even a triple task. The effects begin to be felt, "lamented the spokesperson. 
"The amount of compensation paid, ie 70 million, is equivalent to the new investments announced in the budget for health; Of a total of 33.8 billion, it is a drop of water in the ocean, "Diane Lamarre continued. 
"Let us also mention that four institutions refused to answer us; We demand, for the sake of transparency, that the Minister renders the information that these institutions hold on the allowances paid to the frameworks. This full portrait we claim to allow us to follow up, partial but necessary, the deployment of this reform, whose effects on the ground are not shiny, "added the member. 
"Finally, remember that the request for an assessment of the minister's reforms by the Auditor General remained unanswered, despite the high number of signatories who joined their voices to those of Paul Lamarche, Pierre Joubert and Marc-André Maranda. We support this approach; It seems essential to us that a neutral and objective evaluation is done, "concluded Diane Lamarre.
