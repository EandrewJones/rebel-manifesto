Quebec's party activists from all regions of Quebec met today in Laval to finalize our preparations and consider our electoral platform. People from all walks of life, united around a certain idea of Quebec; That of a nation that has transformed, from generation to generation, to reach this country in the making: a French-speaking country in America. 
Our platform has been adopted unanimously. It does not contain all the program of our party, of course, but it establishes our priorities for the next four years. 
In the days coming, I will state the specific commitments we will take as a government. These commitments are all listed in the Government's budget framework filed in February. 
No tax raising or tight, rigorous, state expenses. We will continue on this responsible path, which respects the ability to pay Quebeckers. 
Of course, we have challenges to take up, like all companies. But does it justify the constantly negative speeches of the Caquists and the Liberals? It is not with an attitude like theirs we will succeed in meeting our collective challenges. To succeed, we must first believe in us. 
And I am convinced: we arecarable! 
We must roll up the sleeves, take the problems of forehead, make courageous decisions. We must act. 
If we want to meet the challenges of Quebec, we need to be determined! 
Our goal is clear: to seek the confidence of Quebeckers to get the means for our ambitions for Quebec. We will do it with the platform adopted today and with the government plan to build a more prosperous Quebec, stronger, more welcoming ... 
More independent!
