Québec- Several Party members will participate in activities that are held throughout Quebec, on the occasion of the homeless night. It is an event of awareness of the reality of people living in poverty, social disaffiliation or roaming. 
MEPs François GENDRON (Abitibi West), Guy Leclair (Beauharnois), Carole Poirier (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve), Véronique Hivon (Joliette), Pascal Bérubé (Matana-Matapédia), Martin Ouellet (René-Lévesque), Sylvain Rochon (Richelieu ), Harold Lebel (Rimouski), Dave Turcotte (Saint-Jean) and Agnès Maltais (Taschereau) will take part in the activities in their respective region. 
This year, the homeless night is held while the Liberal government is struggling to pass Bill 70, which uses a coercive approach to the most vulnerable. "In its current form, we do not believe that the bill will break the circle of poverty. He attacks the poor more than he helps them, and feeds the prejudices towards social assisters. Imagine: Penalties planned for people who refuse to participate in the Employment Objective program are the same as those we reserve for social assistance fraudsters! Throughout the process, we worried about the fate of homeless people, given the Liberal government's punitive approach, "commented Dave Turcotte, the Quebec party spokesman for Bill 70.
