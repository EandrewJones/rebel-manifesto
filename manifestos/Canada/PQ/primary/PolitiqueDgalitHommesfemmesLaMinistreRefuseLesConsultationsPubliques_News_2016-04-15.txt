Quebec- The member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesman for the Parti-Condition of Status of Women, Carole Poirier, regrets that the Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Lise Th√©riault, refused his proposal to hold public consultations for the next policy and action plan for equality between men and women. 
"Just before the study of the credits, along with the group of 13, we have asked the minister to hold his consultations in the open, instead of the closed session. She refused. It's a break with tradition. The minister did not even attend the consultations held with the groups behind closed doors! Yet public consultations make it possible to raise awareness of the question of equality between women and men, and to connect the interventions of the groups, a way of doing more effective than to consult them on an individual basis " , said Carole Poirier. 
The hon. Member recalls that consultations were conducted for the first policy (2007-2011), as well as for the second (2011-2015). At this time, 42 groups had been heard in parliamentary committee at the National Assembly. For the third policy, the Secretariat on the Status of Women has consulted, in camera, 64 groups. 
Carole Poirier also denounced the impacts of austerity policies on the living conditions of Quebec women. "Violence against women is not only sexual, physical or psychological. It is also incarnated in economic policies that hit them directly. Several elements must be discussed and put in place so that equality of law becomes equality of fact, whether in terms of the representation of women in politics or on those of public health, CPE, or the Fight against sexual violence. This government cut massively in many of these sectors, mainly touching women. The minister today had the chance to straighten the bar; She should have seized this opportunity to consult all the people and organizations in broad day, "concluded Carole Poirier.
