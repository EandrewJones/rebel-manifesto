Nearly 15 years after the launch of its first Youth Policy, my Government today released the White Paper a generation to the multiple aspirations, fruit of a vast consultation in the spring and fall 2013, and allowed To young people to speak, express their dreams and share their passions. 
It is a policy for young people made by young people. 
For the first time in a long time, our young people can count on a government that wants to listen to them and who is determined to support and accompany them in every stage of their career. 
Allow our young people to get involved more, give them more ways to act, to invest and to take their place: these are the fundamental issues we will work on. 
Youth is the future of Quebec. It carries a thousand aspirations and hope of a whole nation. Together, we have the duty to offer our young people to take the place that comes back to them, to flourish, to occupy pay and rewarding jobs, or to create their own business and to make the conquest of world. In short, to realize their dreams. 
Our youth is creative, talented, bold, open to the world. His ideals and vitality will help make Quebec a better society. 
Today, I say to all young people in Quebec: together we can start now building Quebec from your aspirations.
