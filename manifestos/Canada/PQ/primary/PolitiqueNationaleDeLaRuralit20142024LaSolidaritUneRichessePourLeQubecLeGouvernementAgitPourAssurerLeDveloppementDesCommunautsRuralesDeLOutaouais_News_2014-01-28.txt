Papineauville- As part of a tour of Quebec that stops today in Outaouais, the Minister Delegate to the Regions and Minister responsible for the Gaspé-Îles-de-la-Madeleine Region, Mr. Gaétan Lelièvre, accompanied by the Minister of Public Safety and Minister responsible for the Outaouais Region, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, confirmed the granting of more than $ 5 million to rural RCMs in the Outaouais region for the work of the national level of rurality. Following a commitment from the Prime Minister of Quebec, Ms. Pauline Marois, to improve rural pacts, the national rurality policy has been renewed for a period of ten years with an envelope of $ 470 million. Created in 2001 by the Parti Québécois, the national rural policy provides unprecedented support to rural and regions of Quebec. 
"The aid announced today will allow those who care about the development of their community to give a new impetus to the most inspiring and promising projects in their environment. Long mature, this policy is based on the capacity of rural areas to mobilize and work on an intersectoral basis: an innovative and decisive approach to occupation of territory and rurality in Quebec. This new national rural policy will allow the establishment of major projects in the regions of Quebec, "said Minister Lelièvre.
