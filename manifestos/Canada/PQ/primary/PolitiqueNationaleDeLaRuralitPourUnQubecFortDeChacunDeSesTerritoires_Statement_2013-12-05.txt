I was very proud today to launch the third generation of the national rural policy. This is a momentous moment in our desire to strengthen Quebec, to fully build a strong country of the diversity of its territories. 
Launched in 2001 by a government of the Parti Québécois, this policy sent a message of importance to our fellow citizens from all regions. We then actually made precursors by formally recognizing the wealth of rural environment and its essential contribution to the vitality of all our nation. 
Over the last 12 years, rural circles have multiplied innovative and creative initiatives. This success has been recognized internationally by the OECD, which welcomed our policy as one of the most advanced rural development support approaches to all its member countries. 
Today we want to go further. In a budgetary context, as you know, complex, we need to set priorities and make choices. Renew our commitment to rural Quebec is one of them. 
By the Policy launched this afternoon, my Government reaffirms its intention to contribute to the prosperity of the rural environment of Quebec. A Quebec where justice, equity, equality of opportunities and inclusion translate into a human and integrated vision of solidarity and economic development. 
Together, we will build a richer Quebec, more solidaire and more proud, a strong Quebec of each of its territories!
