Quebec - Member of Champlain and official opposition spokesman, NoëlThe Champagne, is pleased to highlight the 10th anniversary of the national rural policy. 
"10 years ago, a government of the Parti Québécois adopted the national rural policy in order to give the rural world and to the regions more development tools. When we know that more than 8000 projects have derived from this policy, it can be concluded that it is a great success. Moreover, an international organization as prestigious as the OECD has explicitly recognized it, "said Noëlla Champagne. 
The Parti Québécois has always believed that it is through a lower approach up that Quebec can fully develop all its potential. It is no coincidence that the national rural policy was part of a follow-up of this approach: 
-Creation of regional county municipalities (MRCs),  -Loi on planning and urban planning,  -Political support for local and regional development,  -Creation of local development centers (CLD). 
"Today, the Parti Québécois continues in this direction. We have just introduced Bill 499 on the dynamic occupation of the territory and decentralization and in the coming months, we will closely monitor the government so that it develops a 3rd version of the national rural policy that would allow rural world to go even further, "concluded the member for Champlain.
