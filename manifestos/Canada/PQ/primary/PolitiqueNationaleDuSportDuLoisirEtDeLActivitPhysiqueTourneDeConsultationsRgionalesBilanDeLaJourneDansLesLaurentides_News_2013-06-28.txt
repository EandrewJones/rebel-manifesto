These have the chance to express their concerns and vision about [the future national sport, leisure and physical activity]. 
Quebecers and Quebeckers are also arrested. Indeed, an online consultation is held on the website of the Ministry of Education, Leisure and Sport on the sidelines of meetings with the partners. It will collect, until August 31, the comments and memoirs of all those who wish to feed the reflection and enrich the future policy. 
"The points of view that will be shared during these consultations will bring valuable lighting for the development of the new policy. This unifying project must eventually give everyone the taste of moving, practicing physical, recreational and sports activities, early childhood at mature age. It will also be aimed at implementing measures to support our sports elite and help it even more radiate on the international scene, "Malavoy said.
