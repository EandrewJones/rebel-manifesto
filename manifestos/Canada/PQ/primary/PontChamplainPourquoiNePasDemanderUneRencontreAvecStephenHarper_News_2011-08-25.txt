Montreal - "We are very disappointed with the partisan response of the Prime Minister of Quebec, Jean Charest, who pushed back the reverse of the proposal that the Parti Québécois made yesterday to form a delegation of elected representatives, of business people And representatives of the Champlain coalition in construction: when? In order to meet the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, to require a federal government commitment to build a new bridge. We believe that it is more than ever necessary to organize a meeting at the top with Mr. Harper to get out of the current stalemate who leaves the citizens of the South Shore and the island of Montreal in the uncertainty " , said Nicolas Girard, spokesman for the official opposition on transport and deputy of Gouin. 
"Despite Quebec unanimity in favor of building a new Champlain bridge, nothing moves to Ottawa. Jean Charest's strategy does not work, he needs help, "said the member for Gouin. 
Nicolas Girard recalled that the Prime Minister was imploring the Harper government last week to give a signal about the future of the Champlain Bridge. "To get out of the cul-de-sac with Ottawa on the Champlain Bridge, does the Prime Minister of Quebec have at least a meeting with Stephen Harper? , "Said the official opposition spokesperson for transport. 
The Québécois party reinforces the Quebec Prime Minister again to work together to get a federal commitment to the construction of a new Champlain bridge. "It's a major issue for the Montreal economy. The wait has lasted enough, "he added. 
"Should we remember that the Liberal Minister of Transport again refuses, despite the repeated requests of all stakeholders, to make public all inspection reports from all road structures of the Greater Montreal Region. Had he not promised to do so in the days that followed the collapse of the Viger tunnel? Does he believe that people have forgotten? Nicolas Girard questioned Nicolas.
