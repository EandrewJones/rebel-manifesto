Quebec- The member for Vachon and sentence of the official transport opposition, Martine Ouellet, and the member for Terrebonne, Mathieu Traversy, denounced the authorization given by the Minister of Transport, Robert PoÃ«ti, so that the Toll rates on the bridge of Highway 25 are increased by 26% at peak hours. 
"It's aberrant to accept a 26% increase for users, while the company already gives rise to several million dollars. This measure will be doubly paying for it since, inevitably, traffic will increase over time; If we add to that rising rates, the private company will make much more money, at the expense of the middle class, "said Martine Ouellet. 
The bridge of Highway 25 has been privatized by the Charest government for its maintenance and management. The company finances its operations by the incomes drawn from the toll. However, if we rely on the new grid presented by the company and authorized by the Minister, if you do not have a transponder, you will now have to pay $ 16.84 for a single round trip between Montreal and Laval. 
"Now that the citizens of the North Shore have become accustomed to taking the bridge of Highway 25 to avoid traffic on other bridges, rates increase by 26% in a single shot and the Minister of Transportation seems to find it normal. The truth is that the Liberal government has abandoned the citizens of the North Shore, "added Mathieu Traversy. 
"The Minister Poeti has even tried to justify this increase by invoking the improvement of the fluidity of the traffic on the bridge. Does it realize that by reasoning in this way, it is creating two categories of bridges: a fluid bridge for those able to pay a price, and other congested bridges for the middle class? ", Concluded Martine Ouellet.
