Quebec- The Québec Party candidate in the riding of Jean-Talon, Clément Laberge, and the member for Taschereau and the official opposition spokesman for the Capitale-Nationale region, Agnès Maltese, request that the government funding $ 35 million dedicated to the Port of Quebec is conditional on holding a BAPE. 
"The issue of the Port of Quebec took the whole place in the partial elections. Following the pressure made by Clement, the Government of Quebec agreed to hold a BAPE on the expansion project. However, this idea was pushed back from the reverse of the hand by the port of Quebec. The government remains an option, which has agreed to finance $ 35 million in the port of $ 35 million: that this financial assistance is conditional at the holding of a BAPE. Never has a Quebec government invested in a port facility. Accept that the BAPE looks at the file, it would be a gesture of good will on the part of the port. If they want the success of the project, and in the interest of the population, partners must be trusted, "said Agnès Maltais. 
"This major project will affect the quality of life of Hundreds of Jean-Talon citizens, but it could see the day regardless of their questions or concerns about their safety. The Liberal candidate, Sébastien Proulx, recognizes the danger related to the increase in railway activity, but he refuses to decide on the matter. In this folder as in many others, he has tied hands. I ask him to take a position. The development of the Port of Quebec, it is desired, but only after a credible and independent citizen consultation process, "Clement Laberge concluded.
