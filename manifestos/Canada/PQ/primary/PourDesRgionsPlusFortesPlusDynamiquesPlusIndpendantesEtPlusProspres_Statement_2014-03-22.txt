At all times, the regions have been at the center of the concerns of the Parti Québécois. In this campaign, we are the only team that places Quebeckers in the heart of our economic development. 
We are counting on our team women and men passionate about the development of their environment. I was very happy today to find me with many of them to present our plan to build a stronger Quebec from its regions. 
The economic method of the Liberals of Philippe Couillard is known. It boils down to more asphalt and more debt. It's black written on white in their financial framework. Nothing has changed to the Liberal Party. 
At the Québécois Party, we want to create quality jobs in all regions of Quebec. To get there, we have the best team. We mainly have a plan for more prosperous regions. 
My government has already presented its economic policy to whip growth and develop our economy. A strategy that relies, among other things, on the modernization of our companies, export and innovation to create jobs. 
The Parti Québécois undertakes to continue in the same way by setting up specific government strategies to enable regions to develop according to their own choices and their own priorities. 
The objectives are simple: more jobs in the region, more local benefits, a better quality of life and more economic diversification. 
On April 7, Quebeckers will have to choose between returning to the old liberal business, where we were only interested in emptying the regions of their resources, or support the Quebec party, which has the best team and the best plan for economic development the regions. 
We are determined to build stronger, more dynamic, more independent, more prosperous areas.
