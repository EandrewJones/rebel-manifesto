French is the precious heritage that our fathers and mothers have bequeathed us. This is one of our greatest riches. A wealth that we have the duty to protect, value and, above all, to bequeath our children and share with new Quebeckers that we welcome with open arms. 
It's been hundreds of years that our people are fighting to continue speaking French in America. We have made significant progress over the last few decades, particularly through the adoption of Law 101. 
But the situation becomes worrying, especially in workplaces. 
Yesterday, I was a stomach to hear Philippe Couillard say that the workers, in Quebec, had to speak English in all factories, in case a supplier or a foreign buyer came to ask a question in English. 
Article 4 of Law 101 affirms the fundamental right of Quebeckers to work in French. 
These are stunning comments from someone who claims to lead Quebec. All the battles that have been conducted for decades, the Liberal leader is ready to deny them without a state of mind. 
One of the first duties, if not the first duty, of a Prime Minister of Quebec is to protect French, a minority language in Canada and North America. 
Not only should I be applied 101, but it must be done more, act to put our language in value. 
On our side, we want to adopt a new charter of the French language in order to enhance French in public administration, businesses and municipalities, and strengthen it in workplaces and services. 
We take over from all these generations which, one after the other, fought for French to remain the common language of our people. 
In terms of language, the choice is very clear: return to the liberal years, and see the French back, or give oneself a government of the Parti Québécois, so that French will resume its place as a national language of Quebec.
