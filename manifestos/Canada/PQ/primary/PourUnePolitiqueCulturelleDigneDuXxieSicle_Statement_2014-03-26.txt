Culture is too often set aside in election campaign. Besides, did you hear Philippe Couillard say a single word about it? 
For my part, today I was very happy to talk about our cultural commitments, an issue that is expensive to me and which is fundamental to the Parti Québécois. 
I gathered an exceptional cultural team: with Maka Kotto in Bourget, Lorraine Pintal in Verdun, Sylvie Legault in Mercier, Clément Laberge in Jean-Talon, Dominique Payette in Charlesbourg and Sophie Stanke in LaPorte, we will strengthen our culture. 
Culture is a fundamental element of our identity, the mark of our specificity, along with our language. Since always, it has been by their creativity that Quebeckers have managed to surpass themselves. The fulfillment of the Quebec nation, the vitality of the French language, our economic and political future are largely based on our culture. 
For the development of our heritage and the dissemination of the works of our artists and our creators, the Parti Québécois is committed to providing Quebec with a new cultural policy adapted to the realities of the 21st century. This policy will strengthen our culture to give it the means to develop fully, to remain inspiring and dynamic. 
In addition, we will ensure that all major cultural sectors take the digital turn. In the era of new means of communication, it is a major step forward for visibility and access to our culture. We also announced $ 150 million in the 2014-2015 budget to support the media and cultural institutions, from creation to the marketing of works. 
We will also take care to continue the work already undertaken in the sectors of cultural philanthropy, the future of our cinema and the improvement of our museum network. A government of the Parti Québécois also undertakes to introduce a bill to supervise the new book award. 
At the Québécois party, we believe that contact with art makes the human humane, that our culture is rich, that it is a source of pride and prosperity.
