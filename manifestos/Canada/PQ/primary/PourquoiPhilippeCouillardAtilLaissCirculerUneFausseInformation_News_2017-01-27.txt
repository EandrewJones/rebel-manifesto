Quebec, on January 27, 2017- Agnès Maltese, spokesman for the Quebecois and Integrity Party, denounces the opacity of the Liberal government with respect to the exclusion of Pierre Paradis of the Council of Ministers and Caucus liberal. 
"The Prime Minister has confirmed this morning in a newspaper that Pierre Paradis has not been identified as a result of a horse accident, but as a result of a sexual complaint. Gold, Philippe Couillard let a false information run, transmitted by the cabinet of the Minister of Agriculture more than 24 hours earlier. The Prime Minister therefore bonded the fact that erroneous information, on a major issue, transmitted by a member of his government, circulates, "said Agnès Maltais. 
"It is again on a matter of transparency and ethics that the Prime Minister has failed in his task. We are still waiting for him to transmit to Quebeckers all the information on the management of this crisis. He told us that he was informed since January 19 that his minister was reported to the Sûreté du Québec. At that moment, he did not do anything. Only when he received a formal letter from the complainant that he decided to act. It's unacceptable, "added the spokesman. 
"All these crises that the Liberal government runs through regularly three years are harmful to Quebec. In addition to causing, in the population, a loss of confidence in men and politicians, they divert the attention of key issues. The Liberal Party is worn, undermined by the internal crises, and it is the citizens who make it the costs, "concluded the member.
