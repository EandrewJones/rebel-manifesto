Quebec- The Minister of Labor, Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Ms. Agn√®s Maltese, encourages employers' and trade union actors to recover from the task to negotiate the renewal of conventions collective of 77,000 workers in the construction of the institutional and industrial sectors. 
The minister has already assured the parties that it put at their disposal the expertise of the Ministry of Labor Mediation-Conciliation team as well as that of Mr. Normand Gauthier. They will therefore be able to count on these specialists to accompany them in the search for a regulation. 
"The time has come to take over the negotiations. I invite the employers' and union representatives to put aside their differences and to deploy all the efforts they are able to reach a negotiated agreement. They need to find a pathway for the renewal of collective agreements in the institutional and industrial sectors, "said Minister Maltese. 
On July 1, the National Assembly adopted Bill 54Sur the resumption of work in the construction industry. In addition to putting an end to the strike in these sectors, the law has renewed the collective agreements of the 77,000 unionized until June 30 and increased the salaries of 2% for the period from 2 July 2013 to June 30, 2014. 
"Exercise that begins is important. Tools are offered to the parties, including a resource person such as Mr. Normand Gauthier. However, the responsibility for reaching an agreement is their responsibility, "concluded the Minister of Labor. 
Remember that the last round of trading in the construction industry led to the renewal of collective agreements in other sectors of the industry, either civilian engineering and roads and residential.
