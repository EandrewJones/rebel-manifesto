Quebec- The member of Pointe-aux-Trembles and spokesperson for the Treasury Board, Nicole Léger, denounces the stubbornness of the government, who refuses to include municipalities in Bill 87, law facilitating the Disclosure of reprehensible acts in public bodies. 
"Last Thursdays at the question period, we asked the government to confirm that municipal employees would be protected. The Ministers Carlos Leitão, Jean-Marc Fournier and Martin Coiteous responded to me in turn that, indeed, the municipalities were included in Bill 87, which was already a volte? Against them. However, the next day at the end of the day, the government believed that the municipalities would rather be subject to another bill. What improvisation, what scattering and what inconsistency from the government! The hon. Member for Pointe-Aux-Trembles went out. 
"Let us remember the recommendations of the Charbonneau Commission as to the adoption of a general alert launcher protection system; Twenty-five of them concern municipalities. We have been insisting for months with Minister Carlos Leitão, but, every time, he sends us back to his colleague from municipal affairs, supposed to introduce a bill soon ... but that we are still waiting, "continued the spokesperson. 
"Many groups have spoken for municipalities to be included in Bill 87. It is absolutely necessary to protect the people who are denouncing, the public interest is. It is not normal that so many workers are neither protected nor accompanied. If the bill is not the most inclusive possible, the alert launchers could remain silent, fear of reprisals that can go to dismissal, "concluded Nicole Léger.
