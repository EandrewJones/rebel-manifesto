Quebec, January 30, 2018 -The hon. Member for Bonaventure and the official opposition spokesman on forest, wildlife and parks, Sylvain Roy, is appreciated by the announcement today by the Minister of Forests, wildlife and parks, Luc Blanchette. Indeed, the plan he presented comes to put the last nail in the coffin of the wildlife development of Nord-du-Québec, comes asphyxiate an entire economic sector. 
IN SHORT 
"Minister Blanchet affirms that he launched a" strategy for the vitality of the Nordic Heritage "this morning. The title is misleading: the majority of the sums announced will be devoted to the dismantling of mobile hunting camps, "said the spokesperson. 
Indeed, there is no significant support to stimulate the economic diversification of the region. "Once the camps are dismantled, there will be no help to develop the North, no more source of viability for air transport. The countdown is started for the dismantling of the wildlife economy, "he continued. 
No action since August 
Sylvain Roy recalls that the provider of the North, however, suggested several ways of solution to the minister. "In December 2016, four days before Christmas, they learned the closure of caribou sports hunting, which put their industry at risk. Far from being slaughtered, the providers did their homework: in August, through an interdepartmental committee, they proposed solutions to diversify the northern economy. According to the members of the committee, these solutions deserved to be studied. But since then nothing has moved. Last fall, we challenged the minister in this regard asking him to act. Still no reaction from Luc Blanchette. And today, six months later, it announces neither more nor less the end of access to the northbore Québécois! "He summarized.
