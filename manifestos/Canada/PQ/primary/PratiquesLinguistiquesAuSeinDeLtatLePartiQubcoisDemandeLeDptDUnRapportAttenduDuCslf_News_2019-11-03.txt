Quebec, November 3, 2019 -The MEP of the Madeleine Islands and spokesperson for the French Language Party, Joël Arseneau, asked that immediately be filed with a report from the Superior Council of the French language (CSLF) who was expected in September. This report should draw up the portrait of the linguistic practices of government departments and agencies. He had been ordered from the CSLF in November 2018 by the former Minister responsible for the French language, Nathalie Roy, in response to the decision of Hydro-Québec to transmit invoices in English only to customers who would make the request. 
IN SHORT 
"The official language of Quebec is French, and government departments and agencies must be exemplained in this area. When the situation for Hydro-Québec has been revealed, the former Minister responsible for the French language was right to demand a report to the FSLF on language practices within the entire governmental apparatus. This report was to be published last September; But we are still waiting for it, "said Joël Arseneau. 
The Parti Québécois has also addressed two requests for access to information related to this famous report: one at the Ministry of Immigration, Francization and Integration, and the other at the Ministry of Culture and communications. In vain. "Every time, I was directed to the CSLF. And this one gives no follow-up to my requests. What is he trying to hide? This lack of transparency is unacceptable, "continued the spokesperson. 
"Obviously, there is confusion. Between them, ministers should strive to communicate more effectively! The population and elected officials have the right to obtain this information. I reiterate the request I made to Minister Jolin-Barrette a month ago, during an arrest, but that he had ignored: honor the commitment made by the one who preceded you, and venz the CSLF to make public, as quickly as possible, the report that has been ordered. You have the power and duty, "concluded Joël Arseneau.
