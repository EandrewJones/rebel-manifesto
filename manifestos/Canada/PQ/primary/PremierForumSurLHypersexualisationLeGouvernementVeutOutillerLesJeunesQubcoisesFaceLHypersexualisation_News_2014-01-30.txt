Exchanges on possible solution tracks to counter the phenomenon of hypersexualization were also kept.

"It appears to be clear that we can not content ourselves with the cancellation of" Mini Miss "competitions: it is important to find, in addition to the actions already conducted, other durable solutions to counter the hypersexualization. In this respect, we must question each other collectively so that our young girls grow into a framework that looks like us as a society, "said Proulx.
