Member for Vachon and spokesperson for the official opposition on shale mines and gas, Martine Ouellet. 
The mayor of Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu, Jacques Villemaire, is packed by this twinning. "The exchanges that will take place between our two municipalities can only improve our knowledge on this sector and strengthen our belief to protect our water, our air and our environment," he said. 
"I congratulate the municipality of Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu for this agreement with the City of Millau in France. Just as we, several French localities fear the presence of the shale gas sector in their yard. The risks associated with this industry are enormous and the sharing of information is the key in a context where the government leads its boat without worrying too much about the legitimate fears of the population!
