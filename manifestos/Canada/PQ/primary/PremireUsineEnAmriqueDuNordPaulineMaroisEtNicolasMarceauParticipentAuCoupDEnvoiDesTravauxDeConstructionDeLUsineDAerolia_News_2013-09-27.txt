Mirabel- The Quebec Prime Minister Pauline Marois, and the Minister of Finance and the Economy, Nicolas Marceau, participated today at the kickoff of the construction of the first North American factory of Aerolia. This project represents investments of more than $ 82.4 million, and will create more than 170 jobs. 
"It is with pride that my government welcomes this important French manufacturer of aircraft fuselage elements," Pauline Marois said. Under a 15-year agreement with Montreal Aéroports, Aerolia will establish, at Montréal Mirabel airport, its first North American fuselage plant as well as the head office of its Canadian subsidiary. Aerolia brings strategic expertise that will benefit our aerospace industry, which is already among the leaders in innovation and technology internationally. The arrival of Aerolia in Quebec also opens a substantial market for Quebec companies, which means major benefits for our economy. »
