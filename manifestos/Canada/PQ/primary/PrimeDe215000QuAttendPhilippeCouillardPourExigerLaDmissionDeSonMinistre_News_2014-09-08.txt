Qu√©bec- The member for Taillon and spokesperson for the official health and accessibility of care, Diane Lamarre, judge more than time that Philippe Couillard requires the resignation of his Minister of Education , leisure and sport, Yves Bolduc. 
"According to the information published in the media, yesterday, Yves Bolduc would be one of the 14 doctors who received the most lucrative premiums arising from this measure, which places among the most privileged 0.3%. Recall that 5400 doctors affected a bonus with the letter of agreement No. 245, set up by Yves Bolduc itself. This incentive has cost more than $ 72 million to the Quebec government since 2011, "said Diane Lamarre. 
"We also find that the average premiums affected by doctors from all regions of Quebec revolves around $ 13,000. Yves Bolduc has pocketed more than 16 times the average premium. The minister had the opportunity to restore his $ 215,000 premium to Quebeckers, but, by his refusal, he has shown that he did not understand the actual nature of his fault. His decision does not cause him to have to resign. He has obviously not seized the ethical issue of his gaps, "she added. 
The hon. Member indicates that the measure of the situation is better able by observing that of other doctors who are not also deputies. The minister has been either a lack of flagrant ethics or a serious judgment. If the Prime Minister accepts his behavior, he is then allowed to question the promise of integrity he has made to Quebecers. 
"For having, by his choices, took advantage of this program by not respecting his commitments towards vulnerable patients, Yves Bolduc must reimburse his premium in full and resign. Otherwise, the Prime Minister must take the sole decision that is necessary: ask the departure of his minister, "said Diane Lamarre.
