Québec- "A government of the Parti Québécois will abolish the health tax and will restore Quebec families the $ 400s that the Liberals of Jean Charest have taken who overaxed the middle class in recent years," said the entry? Member of Parliament for Taschereau and official opposition spokesperson for health, Agnès Maltese. 
"We want to restore economic justice in Quebec," continued the member for Rousseau and Finance Spokesperson, Nicolas Marceau. "This health tax is the illustration of a lack of courage on the part of the Liberal Party that has chosen to charge all Quebeckers regardless of their income. The poorest and the families of the middle class are penalized and it is unfair. » 
The solution proposed by the Parti Québécois does not represent any additional expense for the Government. Indeed, the richer people will be more involved, they have been less affected by the fiscal balance effort and who had benefited from tax cuts that we did not have the means in 2007. We will put in place a new taxation that will restore a better balance in the tax system. With the Parti Québécois, it's the taxpayers who earn more than $ 130,000 and especially those who earn more than $ 250,000 that will make the effort. We also propose to review the taxation applicable to a portion of the performance of certain financial assets. Our solution, I repeat, is at zero cost, "continued Nicolas Marceau. 
The fate of Quebec women is also at the heart of the priorities of the Parti Québécois. As they are more affected by poverty, women are directly penalized by the liberal health tax. "For a single-parent mother, $ 200, at the end of the year, it's a difference. But that, it looks like the Liberals do not think about it. We are committed to the good of women, we are committed to the good of the middle class, which is why we will abolish this unfair tax, "concluded the member for Marguerite-d'youville, Monique Richard.
