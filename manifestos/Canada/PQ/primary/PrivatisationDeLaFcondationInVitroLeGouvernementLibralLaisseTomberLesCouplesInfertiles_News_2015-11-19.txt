Québec- The member for Taillon and spokesperson for the Quebec's health and accessibility of care, Diane Lamarre, denounced, along with the President of the Association of Infertile Couples of Quebec, Ms. Céline Braun, the Privatization of vitro fertilization (IVF) and all obstacles that infertile couples have to overcome since the adoption of Bill 20. 
"We have before us a government that has made the choice to privatize vitro fertilization, so which deprives all couples who can not afford to pay the $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 needed. Which is only mathematics for the minister translates into a real human despair. Since November 10, it's injustice and chaos for infertile couples, "lamented Diane Lamarre. 
The hon. Member reported heartbreaking cases, including a woman whose ectopic pregnancy counted for pregnancy, which automatically excluded her from the repayment program. For another woman, drugs were not available in the region, which prevented her from having access to her prescription before November 10, so continue her treatments as planned. 
"The choices of the minister are inhuman. There is a flagrant lack of compassion in this government. We were entitled today to a beginning of openness on the part of the minister, but he refused to commit, despite the promise he had made, that all couples who had started an IVF cycle , including those quoted as an example, may continue. Infertile couples feel not only abandoned by the minister, but also despised and deceived, "said the member.
