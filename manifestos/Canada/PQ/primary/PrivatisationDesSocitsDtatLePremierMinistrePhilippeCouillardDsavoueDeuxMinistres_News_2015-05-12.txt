Quebec- The member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, stresses the fact that in the file of the privatization of Crown corporations, Prime Minister Philippe Couillard completely disavowed two of his ministers, that of finance. , Carlos Leitão, and that of the economy, Jacques Daoust. 
"While in Quebec, he claimed the opposite, the Minister of Finance has clearly mentioned the privatization of our Crown corporations before brokers who were trying to sell Quebec bonds. It is the third time in just one year that the Liberal government lets this rumor run, especially about Hydro-Québec. The Prime Minister then reflated Carlos Leitão, saying that there was no plan to privatize assets. Can he recall his ministers to order and prevent they think about their aspirations aloud? Their aims are obviously not those of Quebecers, or even those of Philippe Couillard, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
The Minister of Finance is not the only member of the government to make statements to the premium; Indeed, not later than today, Minister Jacques Daoust wondered, aloud, in front of a parterre of journalists: "Is it the role of the state of managing casinos? This is a question that can be asked. » 
"It is therefore a new disadvantage on the part of the Prime Minister, who had to be transparent with Quebeckers. Privatization of Crown corporations is not a solution to improve long-term public finances. These companies belong to all Quebeckers, and these have the right to know what the government intends to do so, "concluded the official opposition.
