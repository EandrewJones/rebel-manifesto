Quebec- The member for Marie-Victorin and the official opposition on energy, Bernard Drainville, calls on the Minister of Natural Resources, Clément Gignac, to explain to motorists the increase in the price of gasoline. In recent hours, a sudden increase in 8 ¢ per liter in the Quebec region. Note that a 10-liter increase in the Montreal area, some time ago, had been described as unjustified by a Desjardins Movement economist. 
"Motorists this morning are right to be angry. A brutal rise in the price of gasoline to the pump has a direct impact in the family budget. Minister Gignac must explain this rise to motorists, "said Bernard Drainville. 
Like the CAA-Quebec, the Parti Québécois abnormal the price set at $ 1.39. CAA-Québec evaluates that the price should be more priced around $ 1.35, 4 ¢ less. "The international situation is one thing, certainly, but such a shock at the pump remains inexplicable and the gap of 4 ¢ between the estimates of the CAA-Québec and the real price is considerable. How to explain this? She asks Bernard Drainville, who emphasizes that in 2011, Quebeckers paid an average of 20 ¢ more for a liter of gas. 
More than ever, the Parti Québécois considers it necessary to subtract Quebecers to their dependence on oil that burst an important part of their budget. 
"Energy independence is not a dream, but a necessity; It will contribute to the enrichment of Quebecers. By reducing our purchases of oil products, we can strongly stimulate the Québec economy since the billions of dollars currently devoted to the importation of oil will be invested with us in own energies. Rather than enriching the oils, we can enrich Quebec and Quebeckers, "concluded Bernard Drainville.
