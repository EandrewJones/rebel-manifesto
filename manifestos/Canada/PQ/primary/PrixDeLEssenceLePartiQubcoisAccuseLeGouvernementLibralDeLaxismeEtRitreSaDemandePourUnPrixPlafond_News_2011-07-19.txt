Quebec-more three months after making the request, the Parti Québécois returns to the expense for the government to envisage a ceiling price for the price of gasoline. 
"While the holiday season is full, the price of gasoline increases at 7 or 10 cents of the liter, without any intelligent and valid explanation. To avoid such shocks to motorists, the Charest government should be inspired by what is happening elsewhere, like New Brunswick or Nova Scotia, where the price of gasoline is stable and lower, "said the Deputy of the Prairie and the official opposition spokesman for consumer protection, François Rebello. 
Last May, the Quebecois party invited the Government of Quebec to study this proposal. The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, asserted that his ministry as well as the Régie de l'Energy planned on the analysis of this idea and would do it promptly. 
MP Rebello complains to Minister Normandeau to take and cause the speech of oils rather than consumers. "It's a proposal that has merit and stabilizes prices in the Maritime Provinces for years. If it's good for them, why would not be good for Québec motorists? He wonders, reminding that this ceiling price proposal obtains support from the Consumer Union and the Quebec Association of Independents of Oil. It should be noted that a Quebec family will have to assume an additional amount of about $ 1,000 this year, compared to last year, if the price of gasoline is maintained around $ 1.40 / liter. 
"As for transport electrification, the Liberal government shows laxity for the price of oil. As long as we do not free ourselves from oil, we must take every means to help Quebec motorists who are currently victims of a price of the liter of gas more expensive than elsewhere. This is expected of a consumer-conscious government, not oils, "concluded François Rebello.
