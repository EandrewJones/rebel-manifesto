Quebec- The hon. Member for Bonaventure and the official opposition on forests, Sylvain Roy, deplores the inaction of the Liberal government in the closing file number 9 at the Forest Products Factory resolved to Alma, where 85 workers will lose their employment as of April 1st. 
"It's a real drama that still shakes the forest sector. The government had a great opportunity to intervene to bring together the different actors and, thus, prevent a closure that will send 85 unemployed workers. Unfortunately, he did not respond to the distress call launched by the region and today we find ourselves before significant job losses. Once again, it is the regions of Quebec that are hit hard, "said Sylvain Roy. 
The hon. Member for Bonaventure urges the Minister of Forests, Laurent Lessard, to bring together the various stakeholders of the Quebec forest in order to avoid other factory closures in the regions of Quebec. 
"If the government is serious, it will convene very quickly the actors of the forest to find solutions that will allow the forest industry to remain competitive. He must defend the forest areas and keep the jobs here in Quebec. The environment is worried and the minister has the duty to reassure families who live from the forest, "said Sylvain Roy.
