Quebec- The hon. Member for Bonaventure and Forest Opposition Spokesman, Sylvain Roy, denounces vigorously the draconian cup of nearly $ 10 million in the sustainable forest management program. These compressions are once again hit the forest economy of the regions of Quebec. 
"This program, which allowed forest speakers across Qu√©bec to fund particular projects in the forest and favored regional dialogue, is amputated more than half of its budget. Indeed, this one goes from $ 17 million to $ 8 million, which is a real drama for the forest economy. The Liberal government continues its work of destructuring from Quebec regions. Not only has it abolished, in the spring, the consultation tools such as elected regional conferences, which funded projects in collaboration with the environment, but in addition it amputates budgets for the development of forest resources. More than 50%. It's unacceptable, "said Sylvain Roy. 
The hon. Member for Bonaventure also denounces the negative consequences for forest owners who are once again affected by the liberal government's compressions. 
"Some of the budgets in this program helped owners of private forests to develop their forest lots. After seeing the forest job creation program and the silvicultural investment program being abolished, it is that once more, we abandon the owners of private forests that need a boost to stimulate their Business environment, "concluded the hon. Member for Bonaventure.
