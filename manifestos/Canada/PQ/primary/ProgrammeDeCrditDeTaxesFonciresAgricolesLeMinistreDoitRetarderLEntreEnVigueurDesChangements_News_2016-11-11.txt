"The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Paradis, continues to completely ignore farmers and their anger.

It would take aware of their reality, "said André Villeneuve. 
The spokesperson recalls that 83% of farmers will see their land tax account increase by 30% to 40% on average. "It's just unacceptable and catastrophic. The Liberal government takes, on their pockets, thousands of dollars. Thousands of dollars they do not necessarily have, "he continued. 
"Today, Pierre Paradis has the opportunity to demonstrate that he is not totally disconnected from the reality of our producers. Will he seize it? If it is really concerned about their fate, it must respond to the demand of farmers and municipalities to carry out the entry into force of the new farm property tax credit program, scheduled for January 1st. . What the FQM and farmers are demanding is to sit down with the minister to find a lasting solution. This is the decision that is needed, the only acceptable pathway to untie the impasse, "concluded André Villeneuve.
