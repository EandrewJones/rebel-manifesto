Rouyn-Noranda- The member for Rouyn-Noranda-Témiscamingue, Mr. Gilles Chapadeau, on behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Minister responsible for Abitibi-Témiscamingue, M . François Gendron, is pleased to announce financial support from $ 997,000 to 49 Abitibi-Témiscamingue companies. 
Financial assistance, granted under the Abitibi-Témiscamingue and Northern Quebec Land Drainage Support Program, will increase underground drained areas and, consequently, to improve land productivity cultivated. In the long run, it is the dynamism of agriculture in this territory that will be increased. 
"It's always a pleasure for me to support the companies in my area. Last April, we launched a tailor-made program to support agricultural producers in the region in their efforts to exploit all the potential of their land. I'm glad they responded to the call and that projects be undertaken through this program, "said the minister. 
"I am proud that nearly 50 farm companies in Abitibi-Témiscamingue have been able to benefit from the program. Such a craze means that our region has not lost its dynamism and that agricultural producers feel stimulated by the policies and the measures we have expressed expressly for them, "said Chapadeau. 
"This program and initiatives that it is aroused perfectly agrees with the policy of food sovereignty filed last May. Indeed, the projects implemented greatly the accessibility of agricultural land and contribute to the dynamic and optimal use of the territory and wealth of Abitibi-Témiscamingue and Nord-du-Québec, "held to clarify. François Gendron.
