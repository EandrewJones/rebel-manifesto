Québec-The member for Matane, Pascal Bérubé, wonders about the role of proud Gaspésie who has still not made investments in Gaspésie since the outbreak of the proud scandal by the Quebecois party in 2009. 
"On an overall envelope of $ 5 million, the largest investment was made to a transport company in Outaouais two years ago up to $ 750,000. The other investment was at Marinard in Rivière-au-Renard for $ 500,000. But for two years, nothing happened. Why? It is certainly not because Gaspésie is lacking projects and investments, "said Pascal Bérubé. 
Asked by the member for Matane, Minister Sam Hamad had no structuring response to Gaspéans. "Three-quarters of the $ 5 million overall envelope always sleep somewhere in the coffers of proud Gaspésie, which has no contact with the developers of Gaspésie. Advertised with great pomp, proud had to propel regions with interesting venture capital. It is a failure for Gaspésie, "said the member for Matane. 
He also stressed that the Gaspésie, who has no more regional minister from the environment, a first in the age of 50, has suffered a major slap in the record of the Maritime Verreault. "The Liberal government has unfolded the red carpet for Davie to Lévis, what we agreed, but did not lift the little finger for Verreault maritime yards in Matane. Two weights, two measures. Once again, it is the Gaspesians who are scooping, with total indifference of the Liberal government, "concluded Pascal Bérubé.
