Quebec- The member for Berthier and spokesman for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, deplores the attitude of the Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, who asks Quebec farmers to choose between the Agricultural income stabilization insurance (ASRA) and Agri-Québec program. It is a choice that is not one, because the conditions that the minister offers through ASRA are clearly disadvantageous. 
Indeed, producers who would choose ASA would see their future payments be deducted based on the payments already received from Agri-Québec, due to the problematic of cumulative stowage. 
"By not setting the problem of cumulative stowage, which makes ASRA a lot less interesting, the minister forces the hand of farmers. And, by asking farmers to choose, by the end of the week, between these two programs, he simply tries to eliminate ASRA. Minister Paradis must give additional delay to producers because they should not have to decide as long as the cumulative laughazard file is not resolved, "said André Villeneuve. 
Also stressed that consultations conducted by Farm Financial will lead to a definitive choice for each production, in all regions and at the same time. "The Liberal government imposes a single solution without consideration for regional disparities. The grain producers of Abitibi and Lac-Saint-Jean will have to live with the decision taken for the whole Quebec, even if their reality is very different from that of the central regions. Once again, Pierre Paradis shows us that he knows only one way to lead the Ministry of Agriculture: Divide to better reign. As he did for ancientity and representative associations, he tries to sow the mess in the middle rather than gathering people and reaching a consensus, "concluded the member for Berthier.
