Québec- The Quebec Party sums the Liberal government to make public the letter sent to the Federal Minister Denis Lebel concerning the aerodrome project in Neuville. 
"If four ministers bother to send a letter to the Government of Canada, there must be significant and significant reasons. It's been weeks that we stop the government and the only action will have been to send a letter! We want to see her. We must know the actual intentions of the Government of Quebec in such circumstances. If the government wants the support of the official opposition, it should be known what it asks "," said the member for Taschereau and the official opposition spokeswoman for the Capital-Nationale, Agnès Maltese, in Recalling in passing that, in the present case, the project does not receive the popular assent of the citizens of Neuville. 
The Parti Québécois criticizes the Liberal government from remaining passive. "Federalism of correspondence has not gave any results in the last years. So you have to do more. I hope that this letter states the actions taken by the Quebec government to protect the right of Quebeckers, "continued the member for Marie-Victorin and spokesperson for Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Bernard Drainville. 
For its part, the member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata and spokespersons in agriculture and food, André Simard, is concerned about the impacts of this aerodrome project, particularly on agricultural land, but also on to respect the laws of Quebec. 
"The principle is simple: Quebec laws must apply to Quebec territory, particularly those that protect our agricultural territory. Time press because promoters will be able to pave the track in a few weeks and it will be too late. Quebec ministers must act quickly and get an answer from Denis Lebel, "added André Simard.
