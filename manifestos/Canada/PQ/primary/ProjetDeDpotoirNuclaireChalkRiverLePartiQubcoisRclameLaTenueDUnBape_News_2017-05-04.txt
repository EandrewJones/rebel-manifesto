Quebec- The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on the environment and the fight against climate change, Sylvain Gaudreault, the spokesperson for natural resources, Sylvain Rochon, and the deputy responsible for the region of the Outaouais, Stéphane Bergeron, denounce the fact that the federal government has neglected to consult Quebec as to the choice of the site of Chalk River for the establishment of a nuclear waste dump. They ask the Government of Quebec to hold a public consultation of the BAPE on this project. 
IN SHORT 
"The choice of this site, near the Ottawa River, involves real risks for public health and the environment. Yet the Minister of the Environment does not even have an impact study to introduce ourselves. This is not true that Quebec must be content with being a simple spectator. By not questioning the choice of the Chalk River site, the Government of Quebec abdic to the federal government. The minister must entrust BAPE the mandate to hold a public consultation on this project, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
"The government has admitted yesterday that it was preparing an emergency plan in the event of radioactive broadcasts, to be ready if a disaster occurs. Otherwise, very little information has filtered so far about this project; Most of what is available has been published in English by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. Remember that thanks to the government of the Parti Québécois, Quebec has chosen to get out of nuclear power; We have the right to know all the risks associated with this dump, "required Sylvain Rochon. 
"The site was chosen by a Federal Crown corporation, without the approval of the Government of Quebec. But it is in Quebec, to Quebeckers to decide whether a nuclear waste dump can be installed one kilometer only of the main source of drinking water in the city of Gatineau and many other localities of the 'Outaouais, "concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
