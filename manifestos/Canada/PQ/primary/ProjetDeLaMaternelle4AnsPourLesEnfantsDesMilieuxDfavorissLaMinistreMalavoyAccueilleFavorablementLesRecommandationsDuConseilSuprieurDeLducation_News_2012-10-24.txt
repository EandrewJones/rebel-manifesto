Quebec- The Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Mrs Marie Malavoy, took note of the opinion of the Superior Council for Education on Preschool Education, made public today. She favorably receives the recommendations of the Council, particularly the first, which deals with access to kindergarten for 4-year-olds. 
In its opinion, the Commission suggests that the government is aimed at that 90% of 4-year-olds can attend the state-regulated education and hospitality services within 5 years. It also recommends ensuring priority access to children from disadvantaged backgrounds. 
"I am delighted that the recommendations of the Council and the vision of our government meet. This review will nurture our reflection on how to create full-time kindergarten in disadvantaged circles for children aged 4. It is a priority mandate entrusted to me by the Marois Prime Minister, which aims to ensure equal opportunities in a spirit of solidarity, "said Malavoy Minister. 
In addition, the Council raises concerns that are also those of the minister, namely the preservation of a plurality of service offers. "There is no question of imposing a uniform measure or to make kindergarten 4 years compulsory. The proposed service is aimed at children from disadvantaged circles which, for one reason or another, do not attend CEPs, "says the minister. 
The project to offer kindergarten 4 years to children from disadvantaged backgrounds will become a tool for combating school failure and dropping out. It is part of early educational intervention measures.
