Quebec, November 25, 2016 -The spokesperson for the Parti Energy and Natural Resources Party, Sylvain Rochon, asks the Liberal government to stop taking hostage the energy transition by requiring the opposition to adopt, at the Inside the same bill, the unacceptable chapter on hydrocarbons. 
"The Parti Québécois and all other opposition parties have been open, offering Minister Arcand immediately adopt the chapters of Bill 106 which concern the energy transition. However, rather than accepting this hand outstretched, the minister persists in wanting to associate the law on hydrocarbons, which opens the door to a new shale gas crisis in the Low-Lawrence Lowlands, and pushes. The odious until you plan the gag. Quebec's transition to renewable energies is a major issue that concerns all Quebeckers who should not be subjected to the dubious political maneuvers of the Liberal Party, "the spokesman insisted. 
"The government wants to pass a law on hydrocarbons that not only does not prohibit fracturing - a risky and controversial technique at the base of the shale gas crisis a few years ago - but which, in addition , do not even dare to name it! The minister tries to reassure us by saying that the fracturing will be framed in a possible settlement, but he refuses the same breath to show us this regulation or even to allow the study by a parliamentary commission, when it will finally be filed " , added the member. 
"The Liberal government has refused our amendments to include, in the basic principles of the Hydrocarbons Act, social acceptability, the protection of our agricultural lands and Gaspé berries, as well as respect for the skills of municipalities. It is not closing to the legitimate concerns of scientists, farmers, municipalities and the population that it will reduce the fears of its bill, "concluded Sylvain Rochon.
