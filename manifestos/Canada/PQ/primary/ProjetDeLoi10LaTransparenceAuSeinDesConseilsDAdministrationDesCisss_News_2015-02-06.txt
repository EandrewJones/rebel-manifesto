Quebec, February 6, 2015 - The member for Taillon and the official opposition on health and accessibility to care, Diane Lamarre, welcomes a gain obtained by the Parti Québécois during the study detailed in Bill 10. 
"The board of directors will be public instead of being in camera, as the minister had first provided for him in his first set of amendments. This goes in the sense of openness to the population and will probably have a positive effect on the link between citizens and decision-making bodies of CISS, "said Diane Lamarre. 
"Despite the adoption under gag, we continue our work in accordance with the priorities we have set yesterday; The transparency of the boards was one, "she added.
