Québec- In response to the possibility of a gag for the passage of Bill 10, the member for Taillon and the official opposition for the health and accessibility of care, Diane Lamarre, denounces Minister Gaétan Barrette's method, which consists of "bulldozer" all who do not share his sights. 
"Since day 1, Minister Gaétan Barrette speaks of gag. His technique is to shake up all those who do not think like him. Here he wants to make a sprain with the democratic process; It's not nothing! It is all the more revolt that almost all the groups heard in parliamentary committee was against his bill. Now, do not agree, it is not to obstruct; The minister seems unable to understand this nuance, "said Diane Lamarre. 
The Parti Québécois tries to improve the bill for the benefit of patients  The hon. Member recalls that last week, the minister had to table a series of amendments, proof that her bill requires improvements and that he is not acceptable in his original version. The bill aims to correct the current network structure, which, remember it, was set up by Prime Minister Philippe Couillard and adopted under gag in 2003. 
"Bill 10 aims to reorganize the health network according to the welcome person who thinks he is worthy of judgment in Quebec in terms of health: Minister Gaétan Barrette. This one pleads for an application of his law before April 1st. For the good of patients, it is necessary to take the time to properly do parliamentary work and do not give in to the pressure of the minister, who wants a rapid adoption, but refuses to answer questions. Our work has made a few gains, despite the minister's closure on the majority of our proposals to enhance the bill; We must continue in this direction, "said the member. 
Diane Lamarre also recalls that since the beginning, on this file, the CAQ shares the aims of liberal austerity and endorses the government's attacks against the regions.
