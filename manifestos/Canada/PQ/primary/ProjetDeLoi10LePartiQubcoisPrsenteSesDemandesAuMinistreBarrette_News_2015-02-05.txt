She also presented the requirements of the Québécois party to ensure bonus. 
"Today, seven hours were planned to continue the work. Instead, the Minister Barrette decided to bulldoze the discussions; It is a real sprain in the democratic process. There is no objective emergency to impose a gag, except the minister's dream of centralizing decisions around his person, instead of placing the patient and care at the heart of the system. In the real life of Quebecers, there are so many other health priorities! The minister seems to forget that he has become a legislator and is no longer a negotiator, "said Diane Lamarre. 
Clear requirements of the Québécois party 
"Even if the adoption will be done by gag, we will use all the time put at our disposal to improve the bill. We are constantly aiming to improve care and accessibility. We think of patients, as well as those who give care in our health system. Our priorities are the maintenance of the link with the local authorities, the guarantee of the balance between the "health" and "social services" fields, notably for each duo "CEO and Assistant CEO", the preservation of the autonomy of the Community environment and transparency, among others, the boards of directors of future CISSs, "added Diane Lamarre. 
In accordance with these priorities, we targeted nine articles of the bill that we would like to study first: 131, 134, 34, 22.1, 161, 29, 55, 59 and 146. We ask for the collaboration of the minister so that tomorrow, these articles are studied in priority. If the members of the CAQ let themselves fall asleep by the minister barrette, their former colleague, the Parti Québécois, he remains the sentinel of the citizens, "concluded the spokesman.
