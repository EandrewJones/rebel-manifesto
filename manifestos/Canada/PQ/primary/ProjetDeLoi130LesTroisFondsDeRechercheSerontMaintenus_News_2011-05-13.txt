Québec-The member for Richelieu and the official opposition spokesman for the Treasury Board, the Public Service and Government Services, Sylvain Simard, and the member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata and sentence of the official opposition. research, technology and innovation, André Simard, are very pleased to have convinced the Liberal government to maintain the three Quebec research funds. 
The merger of the three research funds laid down in Bill 130 was decried by the quasi-unanimity of the research partners. "The original intention of merging the three funds surprised everyone, especially since no one had already questioned the structure. Rather, we boast this model as being efficient and effective. The government has never been able to convince us of the usefulness of throwing a model that works well. Our efforts, twinned with those of the community, made it possible to make the government heard. We are happy, "said Sylvain Simard. 
The hon. Member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata, André Simard, abounds in the same direction. "We were convinced that the objectives of savings, intersectorality and better performance could be achieved without the merger of the three funds. Today, the decline of the government proves it. For a year, the research community was mobilized against this merger. The research is the pillar of our economic and social development, we can not afford to lose as much time in structural debate. Now you have to go ahead without wasting time, "added André Simard. 
For its part, the member for Taillon and sentence of the official opposition in higher education, Marie Malavoy believes that "the pressure of researchers and faculty will have helped to make the government sound. So we have worked in the same direction, together, for the benefit of research in Quebec ".
