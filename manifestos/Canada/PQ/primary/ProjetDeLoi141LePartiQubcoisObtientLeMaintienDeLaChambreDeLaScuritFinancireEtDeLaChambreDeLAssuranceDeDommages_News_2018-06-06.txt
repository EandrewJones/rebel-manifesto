The study in Parliamentary Committee on Bill 141, the law aimed primarily at improving the management of the financial sector, the protection of money deposits and the operating regime of the financial institutions, ended today, and the Parti Québécois is proud of the gains he has made for consumers. The official opposition spokesperson for Finance, Nicolas Marceau, is pleased to have managed to save the Chamber of Financial Security and the Chamber of Damage Insurance, which the bill planned to abolish. 
IN SHORT 
The Parti Québécois has made significant gains for Quebeckers: 
"Despite the stubbornness of the Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, we demanded and obtained the maintenance of both Houses. Their abolition was far from consensus, and it would have been a decline for consumers, "first declared Nicolas Marceau. It should be noted that many stakeholders, including the coalition of Quebec consumer associations, also demanded the maintenance of both Houses. 
"By removing these provisions, we have been able to adopt more consensual measures, such as the amendments that guarantee that brokerage firms may offer their clients submissions from several insurers. This is best for consumers and for the financial sector, "continued the spokesperson. 
During the detailed study of Bill 141, Nicolas Marceau also made many gains for Quebec consumers. "I managed to get amendments to the bill so that consumers are better protected when they buy financial products. For example, the conciliation between a financial institution and a consumer will be free for the financial institution. In addition, the sale of online insurance as well as brokerage firms will be better supervised by the Autorité des marchés financiers, and some victims of fraud may now request, retroactively, compensation to the Financial Services Compensation Fund. Bill 141 is not perfect but, in the circumstances, I am pleased to have managed to improve it, "concluded the member.
