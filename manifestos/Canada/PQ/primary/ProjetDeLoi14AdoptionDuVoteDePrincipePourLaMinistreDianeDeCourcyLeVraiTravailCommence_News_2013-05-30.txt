Quebec- The Minister of Immigration and Cultural Communities and Minister responsible for the Charter of the French Language, Ms. Diane de Courcy, announces that as a result of the vote in principle adopted by the National Assembly, Bill 14 will be studied article by article next fall. The bill aims to amend the Charter of the French Language, the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and other legislative provisions in order to strengthen the use of French in different spheres of activity of Quebec society. 
"The parliamentarians of three of the four parties represented in the National Assembly supported the principle of strengthening the Charter of the French language. The Liberals chose to do as in 1977, that is to say, to reject everything in block and to obstruct. Despite the renewal announced by Mr. Couillard, the Liberals always use the same old methods. For my part, I believe in the importance of enforcing the law of Quebeckers, birth or adoption, to live and work in French in Quebec. This is the primary objective of Bill 14, a bill resulting from the notable setbacks of the use of French, especially in the workplace, "said the minister. 
In his last opinion, the Superior Council of the French language pointed out that in the whole of Quebec, the share of the employees of private companies who generally work in French reached 70.8% in 1989. It fell to 59.7%. 2010. 
Madame de Courcy recalled that the concerns raised by the Coalition Future Québec and Quebec Solidarity as well as the suggestions proposed by stakeholders in parliamentary committee will be discussed during the study of each of the bills of the bill. "The real work begins," said the minister. "I will work with rigor and attention to improve the bill with the elected officials who have served their interest. By working together, we can find solutions for all Quebeckers to live, succeed and work in French in Quebec. »
