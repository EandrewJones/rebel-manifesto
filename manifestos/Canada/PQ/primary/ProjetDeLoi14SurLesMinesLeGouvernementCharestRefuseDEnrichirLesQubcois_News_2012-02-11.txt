Quebec- The Parti Québécois does not understand why the Liberal government of Jean Charest refuses to enrich Quebeckers. 
"By refusing to include transformation issues and royalties in Bill 14, the Charest government makes the deliberate choice to enrich large foreign multinationals to the detriment of the Quebec population. Why? In question the member for Vachon and spokesperson for the official opposition in mines and shale gas, Martine Ouellet. 
The hon. Member, however, is pleased to hear that some Liberal members now share his point of view. "Learning this morning that the Liberal MP Daniel Bernard is looking for an alternative to the wrong bill 14 is a good sign; It was time for a Liberal member to get up and make her government understand that Bill 14 does not derich Quebeckers, "she added. 
For the Parti Québécois, the liberal surluers to avoid addressing these issues in the debate of Bill 14 fall under fumisterie. "The natural resources present on the Quebec territory belong to us. It's up to us to make sure you get the maximum benefits. It is our role as elected to the National Assembly and I hear the assumption to the end, "continued Martine Ouellet. 
It stresses that the study of Bill 14 is progressing well and that, 90% of the work has been completed. "Next Monday, we will pursue the study of the bill. There are only 12 items left to be studied. It is to be hoped that the government hears the message of the people it takes, with our resources, more royalties to Quebecers and processing in Quebec. We run next to a potential that is calculated in billions of dollars, with thousands of jobs in the 2nd and 3rd transformation. Quebec lives a mining boom, but the Charest government prefers to enrich multinationals before the population. We need to improve this bill to enrich Quebeckers first, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
