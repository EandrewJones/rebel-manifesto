Quebec- As a result of the detailed study of Bill 15, the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Carole Poirier, announced that thanks to the gains obtained by the Parti Québécois in parliamentary committee, the network of the University of Quebec. Will not be subject to a workforce control system different from that of chartered universities. 
In addition, thanks, again, to the work of the official opposition members, the UPAC will not be subject to this control of the workforce. "While investigations are aimed at the Liberal Party, it would have been uncomfortable to let the current government establish the UPAC level of staff. It was simply unacceptable, "said Carole Poirier. 
Remember that the bill, in its original form, would have submitted the Network of the University of Quebec to a control of the workforce that the charter universities will not suffer. "It was out of the question to let a situation with two weights are created. The Network of the University of Quebec must have the same opportunities for development, performance and influence as other universities, especially since it is a guarantee of accessibility and vitality in the region, "added Véronique Hivon , who also took part in the work.

Although the CAQ voted for the withdrawal of the Université du Québec network of Bill 15, parliamentary work was not done by this training. 
"The CAQ has not filed any amendments. She simply served as a figuring throughout the process. His request yesterday to remove the network of the bill was only a maneuver to enforce a little merit in the eyes of the actors affected by this change. If the government has amended its bill, it is thanks to the pressure of the Parti Québécois and the groups concerned. The CAQ watched pass the parade, and QS was absent, "concluded Carole Poirier.
