Quebec- "The Northern Plan Society seems to be about to build in order to accommodate first people in the South," said the member for Ungava and the official opposition to the Nordic development opposition Luc Ferland, following the refusal of the government to adopt an amendment proposed by the Parti Québécois. 
Indeed, the opposition proposed that the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Northern Plan Society had an obligation to live in the territory of the North Plan. "It seems to me that it goes without saying that the CEO remains on the territory. Why this refusal of the Liberals to include it in the bill? What is the message behind this refusal? ", Questioned the member for Ungava. 
"Since the beginning, we insist that the Northern Marketing Plan of the Liberal government is truly benefiting from the people who live in the territory. This is a new demonstration of the lack of will of the government of Jean Charest. If the principal leader of the society of the Nord Plan does not live in the territory, how can it be so-impruned from the north and act for the people of the North? Luc Ferland wrestled. 
"Unless the Liberal government has already made its choice of CEO and that the latter refuses to move to the North, I do not understand this refusal of an amendment that goes without saying. Once again, this gesture shows that the Liberal Marketing Plan is not a real development plan for the North and its communities, "concluded Luc Ferland.
