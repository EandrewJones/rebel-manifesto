Quebec- The member for Sanguinet and official opposition spokesperson for work, Alain Therrien, denounces the fact that the Liberal government has made an amendment to Bill 28, adopted under gag, which violates Article 45 of the Labor Code and undermines CLD workers. 
Indeed, buried in 148 pages of amendments, the Government, in the wake of the abolition of CLD, forced the adoption of Article 255.12, which stipulates that "[a] a contract of employment, no accreditation or collective agreement within the meaning of the Labor Code linking a CLD does not bind a regional county municipality. " 
"In short, not only put the workers of the CLD but, in addition, one deprives those who will be rebursed from their trade union accreditations, their collective agreements, in short, their working conditions. All this happened by amendment, during a gag, so without any consultation. The government does not demonstrate any respect for these workers who have contributed to the economic development of Quebec. How has the Minister of Labor have been able to pass a blatant sprain in section 45 of the Labor Code? Asked Alain Therrien. 
The hon. Member recalls that all the rules apply during a transfer of employees is a contentious subject that has been the subject of several debates and resulted in many clashes in Quebec. Today, the government told CLD employees that in their case, Article 45 will not apply and that they will lose their accreditations, collective agreements and working conditions. 
"After Bill 3, which broke the traded contracts of employment, the government comes again to the workers of Quebec, and he did not even have the courage to meet them. When will he stop his attacks against our workers? "Concluded Alain Therrien.
