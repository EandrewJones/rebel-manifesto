Quebec- The Government of Quebec denounces the attitude of the opposition parties that are intended to delay the adoption of the Principle of the Principle of Law 37 to establish a moratorium on certain activities related to the research or the exploitation of natural gas in The Shale of the St. Lawrence Lowlands. By purely procedural maneuvers, the members of the Liberal Party (PLQ) and the Coalition Future Québec (CAQ) delay the holding of consultations, the detailed study of the bill and, possibly, the adoption of a requested moratorium by the citizens of Beauce, Center-du-Québec, Montérégie and Mauricie. 
"The question is simple: is we for or against the principle of a moratorium on shale gas, yes or no? We do not want to relive the Bill 43 and lose valuable time to citizens, municipalities and experts. If the opposition members are serious with their request for consultation, they only have to stop their stubbornness. After the adoption of principle, we commit to consulting before the detailed study of the bill, "said MP Scott McKay, Member of Parliament for Repentigny and Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Sustainable Development, the Environment. Wildlife and parks (national water component). 
It is not exceptional to hold special consultations after the adoption of the principle of a bill. Over the past year, six bills have followed this procedure, totally legitimate on the part of a minority government that faces an opposition that seems decided to block the study of the bill. It is therefore for the sake of not unnecessarily conducting consultations involving time and money spending from several individuals or groups that the government proposes to conduct these particular consultations after the adoption of the principle. 
This procedural battle seems to hide an obvious malaise of CAQ members and the PLQ that do not dare publicly post their opinion on the moratorium project. "What is the position of opposition members?, Questions the hon. Member for Sainte-Marie-Saint-Jacques and Parliamentary Assistant to the Prime Minister (Transport Electrification Component), Daniel Breton. We know that the Liberals are behind the financial interests of the gas companies. The position of the CAQ deputies is more amazing, while the adoption of a moratorium on shale gas was part of one of their election promises. Are they for or against today? I'm asking the question in François Legault (the Assumption), Donald Martel (Nicolet-Bécancour), Sylvie Roy (Arthabaska) and Sébastien Schneberger (Drummond-Bois-Franc). Their voters are waiting for an answer. » 
Deposited at the National Assembly on May 15, Bill 37 must move an additional step for its official adoption, a detailed study in parliamentary committee, before returning to all partners for its final adoption. 
Remember that the purpose of this bill aims to suspend the issuance of certificates of authorization with respect to shale gas exploration or exploitation projects in the Lowland-Les-Saint-Laurent until That the National Assembly adopted a comprehensive legislative framework. The maximum duration of the moratorium established by the bill is five years.
