Quebec- MP Martine Ouellet, spokesman for the Quebec's transport, maritime strategy, transport and digital strategy, introduced this morning Bill 593, An Act to counter the illegal taxi, In order to provide additional tools to the Minister of Transport to promote respect for Quebec laws. Ms. Ouellet was accompanied, for the occasion, representatives of the regrouping of the Metallos self-employed workers, the grouping of the intermediaries of the taxi of Quebec, the provincial committee of consultation and the development of the taxi industry and the taxis of the Lévis and the taxis of the Region of the Chaudière-Appalaches. 
"The Prime Minister and the Minister of Transport claim that they are powerless and that they can not counter the illegal taxi, while they have several tools to do so. Cities like Calgary, Vancouver and Paris have also managed to stop the phenomenon. Our bill suggests ways to overcome this liberal laxity, with the aim of enforcing the law, "said the member for Vachon. 
The bill proposes a gradation of measures to encourage drivers to respect the laws. In a first offense, illegal taxi drivers would see four incapacity points in their file, and their license would be suspended for 28 days in case of recurrence. 
"As most of the actors concerned, including the CMM and the Mayor of Montreal, the slightest thing would be that the Minister of Transport takes the necessary means to ensure the respect of Quebec laws, minimally the time that the Parliamentary Committee will last. . To do this, he must quickly adopt the bill that we propose and use the tools already at his disposal to end the illegal taxi. We are of course willing to work with him in this direction, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
