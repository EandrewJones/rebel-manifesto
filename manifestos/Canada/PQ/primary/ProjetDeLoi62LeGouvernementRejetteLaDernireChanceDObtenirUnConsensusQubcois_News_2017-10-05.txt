Quebec, October 5, 2017 -The official opposition on secularism, Agnès Maltais, regrets that the Couillard government has once again refused to join the Quebec consensus on state secularism. 
IN SHORT 
"Today, our parliamentary rules offered the Couillard government an ultimate opportunity to join Quebec's consensus on secularism. Although they were aimed at translating this consensus into the bill, our last amendments were all rejected by all Liberal MPs; This definitely deviates any possibility of unity on the question, "says Agnès Maltais. 
Here are the amendments proposed by the Parti Québécois: 
"The government will therefore require its solution to Quebeckers, instead of hearing concerns. Let us add that its refusal to clearly inscribe the principle of state secularism in our laws sends the signal that the state will have to submit to all religious precepts. In other words, the bill does not protect the state of the influence of religions, a principle, however, expensive to Quebeckers, "Agnès Maltais concluded.
