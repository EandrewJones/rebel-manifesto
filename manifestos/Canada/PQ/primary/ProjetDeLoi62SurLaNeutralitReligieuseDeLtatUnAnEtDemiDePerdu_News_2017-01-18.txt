Quebec, on January 18, 2017- The spokesperson for the Partié Québécois in secularism, Agnès Maltese, welcomes the decision of the Minister of Justice to amend Bill 62 on the religious neutrality of the state which, In its current form, has a large number of gaps. Remember that the Parti Québécois has made many proposals for amendment; We expect it to respond positively. 
"Among the significant amendments proposed in the fall, we must register the principle of the institution of the state and that of equality between women and men in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. It is also necessary to prohibit the signs of religious conviction for people in position of authority, and add the reserve duty of civil servants, "first insisted Agnès Maltese. 
"It is also essential to delete from the bill the exception concerning the prohibition of the face covered in the provision and receipt of public services, and to add the express prohibition of the port of Chador in the Quebec public service. Finally, it is necessary to resume control over demands for religious accommodation and draw tags so that practices in this area are clear and uniforms everywhere in the two major public service networks, "she continued. 
"While the Parti Québécois has been defending State secularism for years, after two and a half years of Liberal government, there is still nothing settled. The government, if he had been listening to citizens, should have understood in 2015 that his bill did not meet Quebec's expectations of citizens. But no! He has been trying for a year and a half, for a "Liberal" bill, as described by the Minister of Justice, "said Agnès Maltais.
