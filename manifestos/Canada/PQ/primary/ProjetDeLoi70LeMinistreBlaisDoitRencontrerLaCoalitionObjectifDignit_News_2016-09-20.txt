Québec- The member for Saint John and spokesman for the Parti Employment, Social Solidarity and Poverty Fighting, Dave Turcotte, and the member for Gouin and spokesman for Quebec Solidaire, Françoise David, Apply to the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, François Blais, to meet the representatives of the dignity objective coalition in order to discuss the proposal it highlighted yesterday. 
"The coalition made a constructive proposal and I think the minister must listen to him, that's the least. If François Blais refuses to chat with the coalition, we will have to conclude that the dice are piping and that he had received an order from his leader, Philippe Couillard, to pass the bill 70 under gag. On the other hand, if he is in good faith, the minister will agree to sit down with the groups to find a solution. The coalition refuses the status quo, it proposes modifications. Why would the minister close the door? Asked Dave Turcotte. 
"The time is not at the gag, but to negotiation. The coalition represents first-line workers with social assistance providers. Its proposal must be considered seriously. I hoped that Minister Blais agrees to sit quickly with its members to find a consensus solution among parliamentarians and civil society. Imposing penalties could lead providers on the street or small crime. Quebec must move towards the creation of an effective program that can help new social assistance providers voluntarily register in a path that is definitely so poverty, "says Francoise David. 
The dignity objective coalition offers two things: 
"Our goal is primarily to encourage people to participate in the workplace return programs, while avoiding them in a perilous situation. However, in its current form, Bill 70 is rather the opposite, "have concluded the two spokespersons.
