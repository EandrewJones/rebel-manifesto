Quebec- The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in terms of transport, maritime strategy, electrification of transport and digital strategy and MP for Vachon, Martine Ouellet, as well as André Villeneuve, deputy of Berthier, have obtained guarantees of the Minister Jacques Daoust in terms of adapted transportation, during the detailed study of Bill 76. 
"On the issue of maintaining the adapted transportation service in the North and South Crowns of Montreal, Minister Daoust has given us clear guarantees as to the continuity of contracts currently in force. There will be no decrease in service, "said Martine Ouellet. 
The minister also stated that with the establishment of the metropolitan transport network, interternational trips would be facilitated. In addition, for areas outside the territory, the regional metropolitan transport authority will have the obligation, according to an amendment, to provide continuity in services for adapted transport users. 
In order to assert the concerns of the population of Lanaudière, André Villeneuve tabled a letter from the group of adapted transport users in Parliament. The Minister is invited to continue the project that offers persons eligible for adapted transportation a service allowing them to move throughout the Lanaudière territory, at least one day a week. 
"This service is really important for people in my area. The project makes it possible to break the isolation and make accessible the various transport services to the entire Lanaudoise population, "said André Villeneuve. 
The Parti Québécois will continue to do its work in parliamentary committee to clarify and improve Bill 76.
