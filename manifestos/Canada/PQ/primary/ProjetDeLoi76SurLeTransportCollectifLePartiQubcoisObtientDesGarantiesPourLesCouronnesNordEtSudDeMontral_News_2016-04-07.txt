Quebec- The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in terms of transport, maritime strategy, electrification of transport and digital strategy and MP for Vachon, Martine Ouellet, as well as André Villeneuve, deputy of Berthier, have obtained guarantees of the Minister Jacques Daoust to preserve the decision-making power in collective transport in the North and South crowns of Montreal. 
"The Parti Québécois has succeeded in obtaining significant gains on the functioning of the network so that the elected officials of the South Crown and those of the North Crown continue to make decisions on their respective territory," said Martine Ouellet. 
In terms of service and for the distribution of funding, amendments to Bill 76 were obtained by the member for Vachon, allowing the elected officials of the two crowns to decide on their territory. "We would have desired more autonomy for the management of bus transport and adapted for each crown, but the creation of the two committees within the network, one for the North Crown and a second for the southern Crown, is a very clear Improvement of the initial project. In addition, withdrawal clauses allow municipalities to decide the distribution of funding themselves, "added Martine Ouellet. 
The Parti Québécois also gave an important gain for citizens outside the network area, obtaining the obligation for the network to provide the continuity of collective transport services in the periphery of the network. 
"It was important for the Parti Québécois that the reorganization imposed by Bill 76 is not at the expense of the services offered to the citizens of the peripheral regions, particularly in matters of adapted transport," said André Villeneuve.
