Quebec- The member for Berthier and sentence of the official opposition in agriculture, fisheries and food, André Villeneuve, denounces the previous one created by the Liberal Bill 8 for the rights of Quebec workers. 
The Liberal bill, which obtains the support of the CAQ, prohibits trade union accreditation in agricultural enterprises of two workers and less "ordinary and continuous". Several of these companies, however, hire temporary workers by hundreds. Thousands of them will therefore see their rights bold by the Liberalo-Caquist bill. 
"We recognize the need for a particular labor law system for some agricultural enterprises, particularly for market garden producers and berry producers whose harvest must be done in very short deadlines and for whom a strike would have disproportionate consequences. . However, this regime must be balanced. Most of these farms are small family businesses. The proposal of the Liberal Party, by prohibiting any right of accreditation to certain workers, represents an unacceptable precedent, "said André Villeneuve. 
In contrast, the vision of the government of the Parti Québécois in agriculture was particularly structuring; Remember, among other things, the adoption of the policy of food sovereignty, applauds almost unanimously by the Quebec agri-food environment.
