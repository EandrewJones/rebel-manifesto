Quebec- The member for Terrebonne and spokesman of the Parti Québécois on the environment and the fight against climate change, Mathieu Traversy, denounces the exclusion of several relevant groups and stakeholders from the Parliamentary Committee on Bill No. 106, An Act respecting the implementation of energy policy 2030 and amending various legislative provisions. 
The member stresses that some excluded groups prove to consultation organizations or prominent institutional actors, such as the Commissioner for Sustainable Development, the Hydrocarbon Conseiling Table of the Madeleine Islands, the consolidation of the organizations of Watersheds of Quebec, or the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec and Labrador. "These organizations are essential because of their mandate, entrusted by the Government, their role in consultation with the water players and their representativeness of First Nations," he illustrated. 
"Moreover, despite the need to make decisions informed by science, several community experts have been set aside, such as the Rimouski Sea Science Institute, the International Reference Center on the Life Cycle of Products Processes and services, or the National Institute of Public Health of Quebec. Eminent teachers, like Normand Mousseau, from the Université de Montréal, will not be heard either, unlike others. Yet it is vital to rely on science to make the best decisions, "added the spokesman. 
Finally, several national environmental groups or clusters should be heard, being daily involved in the debates surrounding hydrocarbons. In particular, the Saint-Laurent coalition, at the Quebec Association of Atmospheric Pollution, in Nature Québec, at the David Suzuki Foundation or Greenpeace. "These groups promote the achievement of the environmental objectives set by the government. It would be normal to give them the floor, "concluded Mathieu Traversy.
