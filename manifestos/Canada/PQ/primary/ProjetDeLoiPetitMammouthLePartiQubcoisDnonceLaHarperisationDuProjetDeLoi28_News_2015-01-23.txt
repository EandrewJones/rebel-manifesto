Quebec- The member for Rousseau and the official opposition spokeswoman in the field of finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, denounces once again the method used by the Liberal government to increase rate increases and compressions. 
"In amalgamating a number of issues, Bill 28 is in line with Harper government methods. Increases in child care rates, the abolition of Cr√©s and CLDs, the imposition of cuts to pharmacists ... These decisions have in common not to have been taken during the budget, but to be added to the bill putting in This budget, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
"The government, with its bill" Little Mammoth ", wants to obscure the debate and short-circuit the legislative process to pass its cuts and increases as soon as possible, which is disrespectful for people directly affected by these measures. . Regions, families, pharmacists and many others are being fucked in the throat the poor liberal decisions. As for us, we refuse to play the game of government; We will take the time to listen to the speakers in the parliamentary committee and to study each of the aspects of the bill, "concluded the member for Rousseau.
