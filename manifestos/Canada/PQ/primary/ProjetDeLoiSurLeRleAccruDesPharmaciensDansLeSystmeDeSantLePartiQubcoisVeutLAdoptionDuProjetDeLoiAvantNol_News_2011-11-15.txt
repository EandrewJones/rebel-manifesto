Québec - "It's almost two years since we call for a bill that will increase the role of pharmacists in the health system. It was time for the Liberal government to finally understand common sense and act. Now we want this bill to be adopted during this parliamentary session and that it is implemented as early as 2012 ". 
This is what the member for Taschereau and spokesman of the Official Opposition on Health, Agnès Maltese said, after quickly taking note of Bill 41 today filed by the Minister of Health and Social services, Yves Bolduc. 
A gesture to make the public health system more efficient at low costs 
This proposal from the Parti Québécois was announced in the spring of 2010 and registered in the program in the program adopted in April 2011. This proposal would allow, once implemented, to the Quebec pharmacists to offer a local service, all over the The vast Quebec territory. 
The hon. Member for Taschereau recalls that the pharmacists of Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick and Ontario have this permission to extend, renew and sometimes under certain conditions, prescribing drugs. 
"When we know that one in four Quebecers does not have a family doctor and that engorgement in medical clinics and emergencies is often attributable to drug renewals, it is the least of things to entrust a party From this competence to drug specialists, pharmacists, "concluded Agnès Maltese.
