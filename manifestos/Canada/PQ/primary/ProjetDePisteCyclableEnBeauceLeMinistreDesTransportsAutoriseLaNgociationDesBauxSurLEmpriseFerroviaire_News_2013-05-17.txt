Quebec- The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the Territory and MP, Sylvain Gaudreault, is pleased to announce the negotiation of long-term leases with the RCM Robert-Cliche, The MRC of the New Beauce and the MRC de Beauce-Sartigan, with a view to the use for the recreational touring purposes of the abandoned railway, between Valley-Junction and Notre-Dame-des-Pins, in the region of The Chaudière-Appalaches. 
"The authorization to build a bike path on this abandoned portion of the railway hold of the Quebec Central Railway (CFQC), the Chaudière subdivision, responds to a request from the environment since 2007. The latter is the first step necessarily In order for the project requested by the community to be realized, "said Minister Sylvain Gaudreault. 
Recall that last year the Regional Elected Regional Conference (Crés) of the Chaudière-Appalaches and Estrie had made public the results of an external study on the commercial potential of the CFQC. The created recommended the use of certain sections for recreational touring purposes. 
"When I took note of the desire to develop a bike path in the railway footprint between Valley-Junction and Notre-Dame-des-Pins, I wanted to assign me to know all the implications of such a authorization. However, the study demonstrates the low potential for profitability in this section for its use for railway purposes. Afterwards, I wanted to see what we could do in relation to their request, "the minister explained. 
"Before people can go ahead in their project, there must be this type of negotiation. So this is an important step forward for the actors in the file, "concludes the minister.
