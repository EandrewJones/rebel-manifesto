Quebec- The member for Vachon and sentence of the official opposition on transport and maritime strategy, Martine Ouellet, and the member for Marie-Victorin and spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville , are very worried that the Company Terminals Inc., a subsidiary of Alberta Secure Energy, has obtained last week the authorization to build its oil port in Belledune, New Brunswick. The project involves the passage, every day, 240 petroleum tanks from oil sands for export, and this throughout Québec. 
"The convoy would go to the heart of many cities in Quebec, including Montreal, Saint-Bruno, Drummondville, Rivière-du-Loup, Rimouski, Mont-Joli and Amqui. The communities struggle to make their voices heard, while the Liberal government remains arms crossed and even refuses to give us its position on the project; On his part, it's radio silence. The citizens are right to worry because it seems that the Liberals will not defend the interests of Quebecers on this issue, "said Martine Ouellet. 
"It's almost 200,000 barrels a day crossing Quebec. Quebeckers would absolutely no benefit and would assume all risks. Our environment and safety are at stake, and the Liberal government does not even raise the little finger to defend the affected communities. If Quebec was sovereign, oil companies should ask for permission before moving from oil cars at the heart of our territory. The Liberals are happy to let the other decide in our place. Why does the Liberal government not defend interest, environment and Quebec? "Asked Bernard Drainville. 
"As if it were not enough, this morning, the Liberals and the CAQ refused to support our motion affirming the role of Quebec in the file," concluded Martine Ouellet. 
The motion rejected reads as follows: 
"That the National Assembly opposes oil rail transport for export to Quebec; 
That it requires the Government of Quebec that it refuses any passage of oil wagons on its territory without its prior consent. »
