Québec -The MP for La Prairie, François Rebello, rejects the explanations of the Minister of Transport, Pierre Moreau, concerning the payment of $ 9 million by the Government of Quebec for the repair of the Mercier Bridge. However, after the "extras", this amount now reaches $ 20 million. 
In 2008, the company The bridges Jacques Cartier and Champlain inc., A company in which the Government of Quebec is a stakeholder and therefore responsible, concludes an agreement with the company Mohawk Bridge Consortium. An annex to this contract specifically states that a single supplier will be retained, the shockbend company. 
It is united that in the signing of a contract, we specifically name a company. In addition, this contract has not been called upon. "Minister Moreau argues that it's commonplace. It's wrong. It's a rarissime case. As a result, the explanations that the work done by Shockbeton would have been in the federal portion of the bridge and its application for excuses are for the least wader! , "Said François Rebello.
