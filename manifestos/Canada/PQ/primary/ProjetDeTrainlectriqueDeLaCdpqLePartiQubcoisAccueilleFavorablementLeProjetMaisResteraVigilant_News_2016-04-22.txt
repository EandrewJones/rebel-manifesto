Quebec- The member for Vachon and spokesperson for the transport of transport, Martine Ouellet, and the spokesperson for finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, ask several questions on behalf of the users of the future transport system announced this morning by the Fund of Filing and Investment of Quebec (CDPQ). 
"Overall, we welcome this electric collective transport project in the Greater Montreal area, but we will be vigilant about several issues. For example, how does the fund intend to meet its return obligations towards retirees while maintaining competitive rates? There is no transportation company in Quebec that is not strongly subsidized by the government and, despite this, many are experiencing financial difficulties. However, all project details seem known, except one: tariffs. The Caisse must be transparent with the population of the metropolitan area. If it is able, today, to publicly speak hours of service, travel times and the number of stations, it should be able to advance on the tariffs it intends to impose to reach profitability and generate Profits, as it anticipates, "said Martine Ouellet. 
The members remind that the Parti Québécois had asked the question in the detailed study of the draft law establishing the CDPQ-Infra and the answer was clear: the government can not subsidize the CDPQ-infra, as it does for the other public transit companies. 
"Several other questions arise, therefore. For example, what are the guarantees, for retirees, that their money is protected, when the Caisse starts in the construction and operation of transit services for the first time in Quebec? The Fund already indicates that part of the project profitability will come from its speculation on other real estate projects along the route. Transparency is implementing so that the people know what to expect, "added Nicolas Marceau.
