Public hearings of the BAPE. 
Three months after the "7 conditions" posed by the Minister of the Environment, David Heurtel, the government failed to conform to the energy project is to Quebec legislation. "It is now acquired: the BAPE will neither the time nor the latitude needed to carry out a rigorous evaluation of the energy project is. We again ask Philippe Couillard to demand from the NEB that he holds the hearings planned only after the deposit of the BAPE report. With the waltz-hesitation on the location of the port and the incomplete proposal made by the company at the Municipality of Lévis, it now seems very clear that the pipeline route is not yet final, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
"Faced with this flagrant lack of information, in addition to the lack of translation of documents in French, the NEB must now override its process, to allow Quebeckers to know, about this project , what he returns, "he added. 
"We now know that the plot of the pipeline is not final; On the side of the NEB, the machine has gone, while the BAPE has not even started its work yet. We are getting passed the pipeline of force by the federal government. What is the Quebec government waiting to ask the NEB to suspend the analysis of an incomplete project? This is the only thing that remains to be done. It is to Quebeckers to decide what is happening on their territory, "concluded Bernard Drainville.
