Quebec- The member for Jonqui√®re and official opposition spokesman for sustainable development and environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, as well as the member for Bourget and spokesperson responsible for the Charter of the French language, Maka Kotto, Support the new approach of the Quebec Center for Environmental Law, supported by many groups, to recognize the language rights of Francophones before the National Energy Board (NEB). They also require TransCanada to submit a project notice and an environmental impact study in BAPE, in French. 
Last month, even the Commissioner of Official Languages reminded the NEB order for violating the Official Languages Act. "In the end, it's TransCanada who should take the blame for fileing a file almost exclusively in English for his Energy project. It is crucial that Francophones can obtain, in their language, all the information on the TransCanada project, in order to seize the risks it implies, in particular in terms of water supply for agricultural land and the Human consumption, as well as the impacts of possible environmental disaster on their territory. In the same perspective, we demand that TransCanada immediately submits a project notice and an environmental impact study, in French, to BAPE, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
"Ignoring the status and specificity of Quebec in relation to its official language in the presentation of such a sensitive and high-importance document is, for my part, of a contempt that exceeds the understanding. Francophones must obtain the guarantee of a respectful process. The equivalent availability of documents in French and English to the NEB is lacking and this makes access to a fair process more difficult for Francophones. That the federal agency can begin the study of the TransCanada project without the documents it made available to citizens respect the official language of Quebec, it is inadmissible! , "Added Maka Kotto.
