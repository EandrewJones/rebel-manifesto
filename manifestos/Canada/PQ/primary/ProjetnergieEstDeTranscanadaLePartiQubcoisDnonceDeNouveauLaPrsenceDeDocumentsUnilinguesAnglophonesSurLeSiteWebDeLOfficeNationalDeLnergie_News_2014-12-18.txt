Quebec- The member for Jonqui√®re and official opposition spokesman for sustainable development and environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, as well as the member for Bourget and spokesperson responsible for the Charter of the French language, Maka Kotto, support the approach of the Quebec Center for Environmental Law and recall that the National Energy Board (NEB) must suspend the analysis of the energy project is so much as long as the TransCanada company has not filed all Complete documents, updated and fully translated into French. 
In the eyes of Sylvain Gaudreault, it is crucial that Francophones can obtain, in their language, all the information on the TransCanada project, in order to seize the risks it involves in terms of water supply for agricultural land and human consumption, as well as the impacts of possible environmental disaster on their territory. "The Energy Pipeline project is TransCanada is already unacceptable because of the risks it poses to the environment; In addition, the company does not even respect Francophones that could be affected, "he said. 
The presence of documents only in English on the NEB's website has also been denounced by several groups dedicated to the environment and the defense of the French language, including the Saint-Jean-Baptiste society. "It is inadmissible that the NEB can begin the study of the TransCanada project, while the documents it puts at the disposal of citizens do not respect, in Quebec, the primacy of French. This demonstrates a blatant lack of consideration with regard to Francophones. As long as the documents will not be translated and that Francophones will only be able to take part in the equal weapon debate, the review process must be suspended, "said Maka Kotto. From the same breath, the member added that all records that TransCanada will submit to BAPE will also have to be in French.
