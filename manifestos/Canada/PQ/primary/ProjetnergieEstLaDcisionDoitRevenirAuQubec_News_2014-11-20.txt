Quebec- The hon. Member for Jonqui√®re and the official opposition spokeswoman in sustainable development and environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, believes that the decision to authorize or not the Energy Project is from TransCanada to return to the Government of Quebec, and not at the National Energy Board (NEB), a federal institution. 
"Minister David Heurtel has sent conditions in a letter to TransCanada, but he is unable to guarantee Quebeckers that they will have the last word on this project. The NEB does not evaluate the impact of the project on climate change, which will do the BAPE. So if the one says yes, in addition to having no tangible economic impact for Quebeckers, the decision will not have taken into account their environmental interests. We ask the minister to be clear; He must assure Quebeckers that they have the power to decide, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
The member adds that the National Assembly unanimously required the Government of Quebec that it assumes its environmental jurisdiction and that it renounces delegating its environmental assessments to the NEB. "The Government of Quebec must now take a step forward: to remind TransCanada that it will not be able to use an NEB right to go against the will of Quebecers," concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
