Quebec- The hon. Member for Bonaventure and the official opposition for information on informational resources, Sylvain Roy, welcomes the request for public inquiry into the granting of contracts in the field of information technology and the Realization of IT projects in the Government of Quebec, formulated by a collective grouping 16 civil organizations. 
"Quebeckers have enough that their money is wasted by computer fiascos. We must act sustainably. We are open to a survey process and public debate, as the collective suggests. It will be necessary to evaluate and adapt the proposed formula to obtain the best possible result. However, measures must be put in place immediately by the President of the Treasury Board, Martin Coiteous, "said Sylvain Roy. 
The hon. Member recalls that we would not be there if ten years of liberal governance did not significantly reduce professional expertise to the Quebec government. 
"In 18 months, the Government of the Parti Québécois had acted on three fronts: creation of two centers of expertise in the region, promoting the use of free software and reflection on contractual practices and tenders. Martin Coiteux must stop blocking these concrete actions so that the situation is improving right now, "concluded the hon. Member for Bonaventure.
