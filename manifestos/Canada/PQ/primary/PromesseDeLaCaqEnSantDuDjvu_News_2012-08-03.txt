Montreal- "Listening François Legault and Gaétan Barrette Today, it would have thought to hear Jean Charest in 2003, who also promised to end as a magic with the health expectation. The lure did not last very long. The reality is that Quebeckers are now waiting an hour more urgently than in 2003. The promise of the Coalition Future Québec (CAQ) is as unrealistic as that of the Liberals, "said the candidate of the Quebecois Party in the riding of Saint-François, Réjean Hébert. 
The Parti Québécois candidate also questions the costs of the promise. After having announced that the problems of the health network would be settled in 30 months at zero cost, this morning, the CAQ announces that the zero cost actually represents an amount of $ 600 million. 
"Gaétan Barrette and François Legault must be explained. Yesterday, there should be enough money in the system to solve all the problems of waiting today, it will cost more than half a billion dollars. Who should we believe? Gaétan barrette who says everything can be done at zero cost or François Legault who says that 600 million is needed to get there? Obviously, there is a lot of improvisation to the CAQ, "said Réjean Hébert, recalling that the Coalition Program provides, in addition, to increase the remuneration of doctors of $ 500 million. 
"For the Parti Québécois, the real solutions to disengorge the health system are found upstream and downstream of the hospital. In intensifying health promotion and developing an effective home care network for our seniors to stay at home as long as possible, we will be able to distribute resources and offer better services, "concluded Rejean Hébert.
