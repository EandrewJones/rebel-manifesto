Quebec- Responding to the remarks of Minister Rita de Santis, who stated that the $ 150,000 target imposed on Liberal ministers in 2008 and 2009 was "Peanuts", the Parliamentary Leader of the Official Opposition, Bernard Drainville, denounces that the minister responsible for the reform of democratic institutions trivializes the Liberal political funding system. "This system has given immense power to liberal fundraisers. He gave money from Liberal funding a toxic power over our democracy. A power of corruption, "he said. 
"His role, as minister responsible for the reform of democratic institutions, is to clean up political manners. By his remarks, Rita de Santis banalizes the problems she should work on, "added Bernard Drainville. 
This position of the Minister of Santis occurs while for several weeks, the Prime Minister persists in refusing to condemn the Liberal Ministers' System to $ 100,000 and the $ 150,000 liberal funding. Yesterday, at the National Assembly, the Minister of Santis and all the elected officials of the Liberal Party have also joined Philippe Couillard to refuse to adopt a motion condemning this system, presented by the Leader of the official opposition. 
"The minister, who should be the guardian of our democratic institutions, must absolutely condemn the system of ministers to $ 100,000 and superministers at $ 150,000. Again this morning in arrest, I asked him to condemn him and she refused to do it. How can the minister strengthen our institutions defend the Liberal system, a system that led to UPAC investigations and criminal charges? Bernard Drainville concluded.
