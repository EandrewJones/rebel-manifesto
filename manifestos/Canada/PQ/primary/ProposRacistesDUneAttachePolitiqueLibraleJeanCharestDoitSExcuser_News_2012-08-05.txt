Montreal- The Parti Québécois candidate in the constituency of Borduas, Pierre Duchesne, has been detained from the words that have been held on Twitter by a counselor of the Liberal Minister Julie Boulet. "Make parallels between the Parti Québécois and Nazism, it's frankly unacceptable. It is unacceptable for the Parti Québécois because we have always been a great democratic party concerned with respect between peoples, but it is above all an insult to all the victims of Nazism. » 
"Prime Minister Jean Charest must apologize and dissociate themselves from these remarks. This is a major slippage. There is no place in the election campaign for so terrible accusations and also abject associations, has it brought back, adding that Julie Boulet should crack against his counselor. This type of skid is a shame for those who commit them as for those who refuse to dissociate themselves. It is an insult to the Parti Québécois, its 90,000 members and many Quebeckers who supported us and who always support us. There is simply no room for this in the political debate in Quebec. I think we are able to debate and have political disagreements without sink into such low attacks. »
