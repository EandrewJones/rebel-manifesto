Quebec- The member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and sentence of the official opposition on the status of women, Carole Poirier, asks Minister Robert Poëti to apologize for the sexist and displaced remarks he held on Tuesday to the Chamber of Commerce Baie-des-Chaleurs. 
Deploring that he would not have time to visit the metropolis with the guests of Gaspésian gourmet dinner in Montreal later this year, the minister added that the spouses were invited, the metropolis with a lot of "shopping centers " Women, according to the minister, would have nothing better to do than shop while their husband works? 
"I join my voice to those of the business women present Tuesday, who considered reducing and unwilling the words of the minister. It is all the more offensive and inappropriate that these sexist remarks have been held on the eve of the International Women's Day, on the Tribune of the Chamber of Commerce Baie-des-Chaleurs, of which 30% of the members are women. "," Said Carole Poirier. 
"Such a speech is unworthy of a member of the government, which should rather be a model. Visibly, despite all the struggles, efforts remain to be done to fully value the role of women in our society. The minister must immediately apologize for his unacceptable remarks, "she concluded.
