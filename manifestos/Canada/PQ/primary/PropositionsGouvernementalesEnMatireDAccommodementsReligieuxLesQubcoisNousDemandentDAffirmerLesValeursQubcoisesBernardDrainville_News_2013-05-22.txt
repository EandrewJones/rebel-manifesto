Quebec- Minister responsible for democratic institutions and citizen participation, Bernard Drainville, rendered public today the results of a Light Firm's opinion survey research strategy Consulting this spring, to find out where the population is Quebec on the issue of religious accommodations. 
It follows in particular that five years after the Bouchard-Taylor Commission: 
"The Premier asked me to offer Quebeckers a Charter of Quebec values, and that's what my team and I worked in recent months. Quebeckers want more than ever that the government protects and strengthens Quebec values, and in particular, equality between women and men and the religious neutrality of our institutions. That's why we will soon be familiar with government proposals for the supervision of religious accommodations and affirmation of Quebec values, "said Bernard Drainville. 
"The 2007 reasonable accommodation crisis remained unanswered. Nothing has been settled. Today, Quebeckers are asking for clear rules to supervise demands for religious accommodations. Quebec society is more and more multiethnic. We are a welcoming people, open to the world, but it is necessary to clarify the social contract to facilitate the integration of all Quebeckers, regardless of their origin or belief. The time has come to gather around our common values, "added Bernard Drainville. 
"Since the beginning of our mandate, we have stated that Quebec identity is a priority for our government. The project we will table in the fall will propose a balanced and unifying vision. Quebeckers want us to affirm and strong Quebec values, and that's what we're going to do, "concluded the minister.
