Quebec, September 8, 2020 - The member for René-Lévesque and spokesman for the Quebecois and Finance Party, Martin Ouellet, invites Quebeckers to be heard and claiming free access to protection measures of their credit file provided for Bill 53, Credit Evaluation Agents Act. For this purpose and on their behalf, he will submit soon to the National Assembly a petition that he sponsors, initiated by the Union of Consumers. 
IN SHORT 
The member for René-Lévesque believes that all Quebeckers should be able to benefit - as soon as possible and without fees - measures to protect their credit record contained in Bill 53. "I can not accept that Quebecers are at risk because they can not afford to pay a credit lock on their file. Currently, credit agencies require exaggerated expenses simply to inform you that your file is subject to suspicious activities, "illustrated Martin Ouellet. 
During special consultations on the bill, moreover, most stakeholders agreed to claim the free protective measures. Even credit agencies were ready to move forward, while they should probably finance these measures for the good of consumers. Desjardins - the only financial institution that held good to present themselves to the consultations, by the passing - has also supported this position, put forward last December by the Parti Québécois. 
"No one is immune from data theft, and all Quebeckers should benefit from the same protection against this scourge. I invite them to apply this solidarity that is characterized to signify the petition, "concluded the member.
