Quebec, December 15, 2016 -The Parti Québécois spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Sylvain Rochon, asks the Liberal government to cease to take refuge behind administrative processes and to take a clear political decision As for the oil exploration project on the island of Anticosti. 
Recall that earlier this week, the Ministry of Sustainable Development, the Environment and Fighting Climate Change confirmed that from the administrative point of view, its regulations have been respected and that it authorizes the change location of a drill site where the first hydraulic fracturing operations should be carried out on the island of Anticosti. 
"Despite the environmental flavor of Philippe Couillard, the oil and gas exploration project continues to grow in Anticosti, particularly because of this decision and Bill 106, adopted by force, under gag. Only a clear political decision would dispel the confusion that reigns regarding the intentions of the Liberal government in this file. His current attitude, which consists of criticizing the contract without doing anything to end, is indecent, "said Sylvain Rochon. 
"The government must, without delay, undertake negotiations to terminate the contract that binds it to its private sector partners in the Anticosti hydrocarbon joint venture. If financial compensation must be offered, which is entrusted to a competent and neutral agency to assess the amount, and terminate this project with respect to the partners involved, "concluded the member.
