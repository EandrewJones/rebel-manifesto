Quebec - "Bill 103, partially became the Gag 115 law on gateways, included other articles than those relating to these schools. These articles aimed to reinforce certain provisions of the Charter of the French Language concerning the linguistic policies of academic institutions and municipalities. This bill also included an important amendment to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to affirm French as the official language of Quebec and fundamental element of its cultural heritage and social cohesion. But the answer from Minister Christine St-Pierre this morning is unequivocal: she never had the real intention of making these changes. It's a shame ". 
This is said by the member for Borduas and the official opposition on the language opposition, Pierre Curzi, who described these measures of "candy measures in order to swallow the snake of bridges". 
Curzi was questioning the absence of a new bill incorporating these measures, an intent expressed by Minister St-Pierre on the occasion of the study of credits a few weeks ago. "This morning, everyone will have understood the minister's answers that it does not intend to propose these measures again in another bill," added the member for Borduas. Rather than protecting the French language, the minister does exactly the opposite, "added the member for Borduas. 
"While all figures and linguistic indicators have feared an Anglicisation of Greater Montreal, Minister St-Pierre prefers to declare a passive and ineffective attitude rather than attempt to remedy the situation by strengthening the application of the Charter. It's appalling. If it does not have an interest in this crucial issue, that it tells it to the Prime Minister, "concluded Pierre Curzi.
