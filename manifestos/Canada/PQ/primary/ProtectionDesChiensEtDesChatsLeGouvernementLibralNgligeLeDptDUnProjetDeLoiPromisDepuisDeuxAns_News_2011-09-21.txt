Quebec - Following the seizure of more than 500 dogs in Outaouais in what appears to be a puppy factory, the member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata and the official opposition spokesman for agriculture and food, André Simard, challenging Minister Pierre Corbeil to respect his government's commitment to protect pets in Quebec.
"In October 2009, after the careful work of a working group, a report was tabled by the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister had committed to amend the Animal Health Protection Act to revise upward again. Fines and penalties planned against animal abuse. Two years later, the government has still not acted in this direction. It's pure negligence, "said MP André Simard.
The member wonders why recent seizure in Outaouais did not take place before the local SPCA asserts that this location has been in its pattern for a long time. "Why has the government long awaited and today starts in reaction mode? Why did not he act if he was aware that something was wrong for several years? Mr. Simard is questioned.
He doubts that the proposed pet protection regulation will truly solve problems. "The government has no portrait of the pet sector in Quebec. He does things upside down, "concluded André Simard.
