Quebec- The Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, today denounced the liberal decline for the protection of headquarters, while the government abandons its promise. 
"In a few months, Quebec has lost the property of Cirque du Soleil, Rona, St-Hubert, and this, in the total indifference of the Prime Minister. However, it is a political issue. At the last election campaign, the Prime Minister and his economic trio promised the opposite. They had committed to drawing in the Generation Fund to protect our headquarters. It was March 13, 2014, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
The Minister of Transport, then a member of the economic trio, has declared: "[n] OTRE PROPOSAL would have allowed us to intervene quickly in the case of [buying public offers] hostile on Rona and Osisko, and to work in Collaboration with the management of these companies to maintain their respective headquarters in Quebec ". 
"The Prime Minister must explain to us why today he says exactly the opposite of what he claimed in the election campaign. Does he go, yes or no, keep his promise to create a head office protection fund at the Caisse de Dépôt? While he is unable to say why he denies the commitments he took himself in March 2014, the question is: what will be the next company to leave Quebec while the government does nothing? ", Concluded the leader of the Parti Québécois.
