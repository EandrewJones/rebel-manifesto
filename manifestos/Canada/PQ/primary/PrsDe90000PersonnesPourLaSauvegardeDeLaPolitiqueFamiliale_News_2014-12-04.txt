Quebec- The member for Terrebonne and official opposition on the family, Mathieu Traversy, said today to the National Assembly a petition signed by 86,172 persons claiming the safeguarding of Quebec family policy. This petition was initiated by the Quebec Association of CEPs and seconded by the campaign still crazy about our children? 
"All the signatories come to the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Family, Francine Charbonneau, that we are holding to the measures of family policy. In eight months, the minister managed to stand almost all of the child care network. Its ideological decisions are worrying the families of Quebec. More than 50,000 parents demonstrated in the streets, and nearly 90,000 signed the petition; When will the minister listen to them? ", Questioned Mathieu Traversy. 
Remember that Prime Minister Philippe Couillard has lied to Quebec families in election campaign, while promising not to increase child care rates and continue to develop the network. "Not only has the government slowed off the places, but it has also imposed a tariff shock to families, a real family tax that strikes those of the middle class. The betrayal of the Liberal government is manifest; He must back on his decisions, which go against the very spirit of Quebec family policy, "said the member for Terrebonne.
