Quebec, December 4, 2019 - This morning at the National Assembly, the member for Rimouski and spokesman for the Quebecois for seniors and caregivers as well as in the area of social solidarity, Harold Lebel, presented the draft Law No 497, An Act to amend the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms with the aim of strengthening the protection of senior rights and creating the seniors' protector. 
IN SHORT 
To continue to build a fair society, it must imperatively have a dedicated resource entirely to protect and defend the rights of seniors. "As Vice-President of the Human Rights and Youth Rights Commission, the Elders' Protector will be able to support and support people in need, hear complaints and denunciations, inspect residencies and make recommendations. In short, in short, contribute to ensuring respect for the rights and dignity of seniors. He will act as a kind of "fast track" for them because they do not have the luxury of being able to wait, "first declared Harold Lebel. 
"The seniors' protector will have as mandate to limit and prevent abuse as much as possible, regardless of the face it borrows. To do this, our bill extends protection against exploitation to elderly or disabled people in all forms of abuse - whether physical, psychological, financial, sexual, etc. I invite the government to welcome our bill; This is what it can do best for the elders of Quebec, "added the spokesman. 
"It is clear that every day brings a new history of horror about an elderly person who is abused. Also believe in organizational abuse, caused among others by the lack of staff - even if it does its best -, poor working conditions and the obsolescent of equipment and facilities. But the situation, if we rely on the demographic curve, will not improve itself; The number of seniors will continue to increase in Quebec, and quickly. The defense of their rights therefore becomes a major issue, one of the most important of the 21st century, moreover, "concluded Harold Lebel.
