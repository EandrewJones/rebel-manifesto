Quebec, on April 7, 2020 - Due to the civid-19 pandemic, the level of anxiety of citizens can increase to a point such that some are tempted to consider a solution that is not one: the suicide. "It is essential to provide all the necessary support for the resources in place; We must help those who help, "insists the hon. Member for Rimouski and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in social solidarity and social services, Harold Lebel. 
IN SHORT 
There is already a significant increase in the volume of appeals in suicide prevention centers across Quebec. "The situation is likely to worsen more, while François Legault's government is about to unveil its numbers. Transparency is important, but we can not deny that this may have an impact on the morale of citizens, as we have seen in Ontario and British Columbia, for example. However, our help resources are already overwhelmed, "mentioned the member. 
What's more, stakeholders are worried. "What if ever we had one or more cases in a call center, if some had to stop their operations? The government has asked them to find alternatives, possibly by redirecting calls to a center of another region, but it remains that additional staff will need. We therefore want the government to appeal to retirees or volunteers trained to intervene with people in distress, "added Harold Lebel. 
Of course, this will not happen at zero cost. "Quebec will have to inject the amounts needed to allow centers and aid lines to continue their mission. Listening and accompaniment services must continue to be available at all times. We do not have the right to leave anyone in plan, and more particularly in this period, "concluded the hon. Member for Rimouski.
