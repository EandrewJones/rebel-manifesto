Quebec-the member for Marie-Victorin and the official opposition on energy, Bernard Drainville, finds irresponsible the fact that the Minister of Natural Resources, Clément Gignac, did not claim economic assessment of the Oil deposit discovered at the island of Anticosti. 
Asked at the National Assembly today, Minister Gignac appeared to ignore that section 176 of the Mining Act allows the Minister to obtain an economic assessment of an oil deposit. 
"It is absolutely overthrown that the Liberal government refuses to know the extent of the oil deposit on Anticosti Island. Independent assessments unveiled by the Pétrolia company speak 30 billion oil barrels. This deposit has the potential to become a real "Klondike" for Quebec and the Charest government has let it spin for a bite of bread, "denounced the member. 
The Québécois party believes that this oil belongs to Quebeckers and it is imperative that the secret agreement entered into in 2007, by which Hydro-Québec has yielded its rights to anticosti oil, which is known to the population. 
"For months, the government has refused to reveal any information on this agreement. It is not normal that we can not know the royalty that Quebeckers will receive from Petrolia. It is not normal that we do not know the value of oil at the island of Anticosti. This resource is ours and Quebeckers are entitled to know, "concluded Bernard Drainville.
