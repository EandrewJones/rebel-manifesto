Joliette- The Partician Party challenges the Liberal government to take immediate action to proceed with the inspection, inform the population and ask the necessary actions to secure the approximately 600 orphan wells in Quebec. 
"These natural gas, oil and brine wells, scattered on the territory, require a tight follow-up by the government authorities. We now know, with the problems encountered with the hydraulic exploration and fracturing of shale gases, that orphaned wells can be very problematic, "worked with the member for Vachon and spokesperson for the official opposition. of shale mines and gas, Martine Ouellet. 
"The BAPE has been very clear in its report on the exploration and exploitation of shale gases. It is necessary to set up the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks (MDDEP) a tight environmental monitoring program for orphan wells. This plan, as in the case of landfill sites, should be linked to obtaining a certificate of authorization under section 22 of the Environmental Quality Act, "continued, for His share, the member for the Assumption and Spokesperson for Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks, Scott McKay. 
"In the detailed study of Bill 14, we filed an amendment for the obligation for the gas to file a well-redevelopment and restoration plan and the deposit of financial guarantees for closing the wells. The government refused our requests. With the information unveiled today, the Government has an obligation to act and to provide for a comprehensive plan with amendments to the Mining Act and a MDDEP Monitoring Plan for Orphan Wells in Quebec, "concluded Martine Ouellet. .
