Quebec- The member for Vachon and spokesman for the Quebec's transport, maritime strategy and transport electrification, Martine Ouellet, is very surprised to hear the Prime Minister, at the Paris Conference, ask the Government federal government to do more in public transport. 
"It's good that Mr. Couillard presses the federal government to do its share of collective transportation, but what does the Government of Quebec do? Currently, nearly $ 500 million from the Green Fund and dedicated to collective transport sleep in the coffers of the Government of Quebec. During this time and since the arrival of the Liberal Party of Quebec, all major collective transport projects are on the ice; Let's think about the extension of the Montreal's blue line, at the Québec Québec-Lévis bus and the one on Pie-IX, the light rail system on the new Champlain bridge, with the electrification of the Saint-Michel axis , and so on. The Couillard Government has one of the worst balance sheets of collective transportation; I do not see who he can do lessons, "said Martine Ouellet. 
In addition, yesterday, we learned that real estate projects were in planning around the stations of the possible lightweight rail system that would be laid out on the new Champlain bridge, while the decision of the Government of Quebec and the Caisse de Deposit and placement on the realization of the project will not be taken before more than one year. 
"The Marois government had decided by choosing the light rail system as a collective mode of transport on the new Champlain Bridge. He had even launched the project office. Another file that has lead in the wing since the arrival of the Liberal Party of Quebec in power. The citizens of the South Shore can only dream of the project, now. It has been more than a decade since it is studied and the government continues to lengthen delays by ordering other studies, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
