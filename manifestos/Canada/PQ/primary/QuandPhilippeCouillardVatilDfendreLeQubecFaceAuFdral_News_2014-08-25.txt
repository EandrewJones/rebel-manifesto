Quebec- MP for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, asks the Liberal government to stand against Ottawa's unilateral initiatives about the financing of health and infrastructure . 
"Philippe Couillard first affirmed last week that he agreed with the decline in federal health transfers. Today, Ottawa closes the door to an increase in infrastructure funding. Does Philippe Couillard also resigns in this file? The Conservative government is preparing for elections at the expense of the Quebec budget. The Liberal government must say high and strong that it will not happen like that, "said Stéphane Bergeron. 
Where is the beautiful collaboration? 
While the Couillard Government is about to make important cuts in Quebec public finances, how can it be admitted that it is aware of significant income from the federal government? Could the Liberals be bothering to defend the interests of Quebec in Ottawa? It should be noted that the changes proposed by the Conservative government, with regard to federal health transfers, will result in a shortfall of more than $ 9 billion over 10 years for Quebec's finances. 
"Where is the collaboration taped by the first two ministers in recent months? Obviously, it is one way; It is Stephen Harper who decides and Philippe Couillard, for his part, accepts consistently the decisions that will do very badly in Quebec and its economy. Is the profession of federalist faith from Prime Minister Couillard at this deep point that it requires him that he crosses his arms, without formulating any request or objection, when the higher interests of Quebec are involved? Stéphane Bergeron concluded.
