Quebec- The member for Jonquière, Sylvain Gaudreault, as well as the hon. Member for Chicoutimi, a parliamentary leader of the official opposition and spokesperson for economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Stéphane Bédard, deplore the Loss of 140 jobs and the permanent closing of the Graphic Packaging Holding cardboard plant in Jonquière. 
"Our thoughts are first with workers and their families. They live a difficult time and the government must help them, beyond a phone call with Emploi-Québec. The story is repeated again. The plant was bought for its technology and it will be relocated. This is unacceptable. Let us remember Novelis, who lived the same thing in May 2012. This time, what did the Liberal government do to prevent the loss for the region with revolutionary technology and related jobs? Sylvain Gaudreault said. 
"With the Liberal government's economic non-economic intervention strategy, everyone is currently losing. There is a real haemorrhage in terms of employment, particularly in the region. The Prime Minister must get off their arms and act to support job creation. That he demonstrates that he has a vision, because currently everyone in doubt, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
MPs once again ask the Prime Minister to hold a forum on the economy and employment in Quebec, so that everyone works in the same direction. "The Quebec economy is down, and the government does not know how to act. It is necessary to meet all the actors and to listen to them. Quebec must give the legal and regulatory ways to protect its economic and technological jewels. This is called economic nationalism while the successive liberal governments are in favor of an economic leaving, which is particularly bad in the regions of Quebec, "concluded the hon. Member for Chicoutimi.
