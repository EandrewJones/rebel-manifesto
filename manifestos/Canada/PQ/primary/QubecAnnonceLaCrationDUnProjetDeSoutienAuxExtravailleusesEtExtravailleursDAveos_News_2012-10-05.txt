Montréal- The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Agnès Maltais, announced the implementation of a support project to help staff affected by closure from the Aveos factory in Montreal. This project will affect at least 700 former workers looking for a job. It will be operational next week. The announcement was with Mr. Richard Guay, President of the Aveos Employees Union. 
"When closing the company, there are 1,800 workers who have been affected. It is important for the Quebec government to offer them help to reintegrate a job quickly. I want to ensure these people that they can count on job services in Québec. I am very sensitive to their difficult situation, since they are currently left behind, "said Agnès Maltais. 
In the coming days, Emploi-Québec will set up a project to support ex-workers and ex-workers of Aveos. It is a question of ensuring that the majority of them can be reclassified to meet the labor needs of the aerospace industry. An action plan is currently developing to ensure consultation with job partners-Québec, including the union, industrial clusters and employability organizations. 
Note that the former workers of Aveos have access to employment measures and services. The support project will focus and better coordinate efforts to facilitate rapid reintegration into the labor market. 
It should be noted that the Aveos company is of federal jurisdiction and, despite this fact, Employment-Québec ensures the help including ex-workers of Aveos need. The transfer of Air Canada (ACTS) technical services as a result of the restructuring of Air Canada in 2004, AVEOS closed on March 19, 2012 leading to the dismissal of 1,800 people in Montreal. "We have a duty to help those licensed in Quebec, regardless of the affiliation of their employer. The Quebec government will not let them down, "concluded Minister Maltese.
