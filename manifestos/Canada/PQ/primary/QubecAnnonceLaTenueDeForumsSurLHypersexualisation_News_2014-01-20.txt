Laval- The Parliamentary Assistant of the Minister responsible for the Status of Women and MP by Sainte-Rose, Ms. Suzanne Proulx, announced that she was mandated by the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister Responsible for the Status of Women, Agn√®s Maltais, to deepen the Reflection of the Government of Quebec on the problem of the hypersexualization of girls, in collaboration with the secretariat on the status of women. 
"The sexualization of the public space ensures that young people are more exposed than ever to women's reducing images. However, the internalization of this speech by our young people is not without consequences for the psychological, physical and sexual health of young girls and adolescent girls. It is important to worry about this issue and give us the means to act collectively, "Maltais said. 
"As many studies have shown, hypersexualization can have harmful consequences for our girls. Moreover, this phenomenon would not be foreign to social problems as serious as sexual exploitation and trafficking in people. It is therefore important for us to exchange with civil society actors who are concerned about hypersexualization, "said Proulx. 
The minister's parliamentary assistant will lead four forums, this spring, through Quebec to enrich the government's reflection on this subject. 
The first forum will be held in Laval, on January 30th. It is part of a desire not only to document the situation and to identify the issues, but also, more broadly, to mobilize all the stakeholders in order to act, collectively, to counter this phenomenon.
