I am very proud to announce that from today, the Government of Quebec takes up its rights on natural resources that belong to all Quebeckers. The potential impact of this important announcement could have a decisive impact on the Quebec economy. 
For my government, promoting energy independence is a priority. Through our ambitious transport electrification policy, we have accelerated our transition to renewable resources. But, in the meantime, we must imperatively reduce our dependence on foreign oil by substituting energy from here. 
The business model we have chosen allows the government to play a central role in the project and to ensure the interests of Quebecers. It will ensure that the oil potential assessment will be conducted responsibly, safely, with respect for environmental standards and in collaboration with local communities. 
This is the best guarantee for the interests of Quebeckers to always be taken into consideration, at every stage of the project. Above all, we will finally have full mastery on the future of natural wealth that belong to us and let us bequeath to future generations. 
In the long term, the Quebec state will control nearly 50% of the licenses on the island of Anticosti and eventually perceive more than 60% of the benefits related to oil exploitation. 
Economic benefits that preliminary assessments estimate $ 45 billion over 30 years, including royalties, tax revenues and profits related to participation. All of this is in addition to the creation of hundreds of quality jobs. 
Natural resources belonging to us, greater energy independence, more energy produced here responsibly, it means more prosperity for Quebec. All Quebeckers will be richer, collectively and individually. 
That's it, a more proud Quebec and stronger.
