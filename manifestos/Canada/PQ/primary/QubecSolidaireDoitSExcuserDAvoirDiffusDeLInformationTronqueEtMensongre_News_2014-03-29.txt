Montréal- "Quebec Solidaire must apologize for the accusations that it has launched against the candidate of the Parti Québécois in St. Jerome, Pierre Karl Péladeau. He must apologize for using truncated and false information, and to have dulled the population by holding totally irresponsible remarks, "said Pierre Paquette, Quebec's party candidate in the Assumption. 
"Quebec Solidarity wanted to attack the Parti Québécois but, finally, he splashed several respected Quebec companies and who have subsidiaries registered in Delaware, including Desjardins, Cirque du Soleil, Jean Coutu, Domtar. He also dirty organizations like Greenpeace, Oxfam and World Vision, also present in this US state, "added the candidate. 
Many companies around the world doing business in the United States are companies in the state of Delaware, as it has adopted corporate laws that are deemed in international markets. This explains that a large number of companies choose to incorporate there. 
"The affirmations of Quebec solidarity are absurd and ridiculous. There are limits to preparing press outputs from sloping and unfounded research, "Pierre Paquette pointed. 
"By systematically attacking the Parti Québécois, Quebec solidarity is mistaken. The only candidate for the post of prime minister who put his money in a tax haven, it's Philippe Couillard. Instead of striking on the only progressive party capable of training a government, Quebec Solidarity should take the time to apologize with all the organizations that have been soiled by its exit and have deceived voters with Truncated and false information, "concluded the candidate.
