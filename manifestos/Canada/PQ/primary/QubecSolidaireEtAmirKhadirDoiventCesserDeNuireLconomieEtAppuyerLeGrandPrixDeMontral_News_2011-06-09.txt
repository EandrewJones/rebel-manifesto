Quebec - The member for Matane and the official opposition spokesman, Pascal Bérubé, denounces the position of the member for Mercier, Amir Khadir, who opposes the holding of the Montreal Grand Prix. Indeed, MP Khadir will participate next Sunday at a demonstration against the holding of this world-class event that sets up our metropolis. 
"Renouncing the Grand Prix of Montreal is to give up the economic benefits that would reach nearly $ 100 million. Renouncing this major event, it is also harmful to thousands of hotels in the hotel, catering and businesses enjoying these major benefits, "said Pascal Bérubé. 
The hon. Member recalls that since 1978, the Montreal Grand Prix is a pride for Quebec. "In addition to a world showcase, the Grand Prix allows Montreal to vibrate intensely. In addition, hundreds of Quebecers, from all over Quebec, meet in the metropolis. In this sense, Mr. Khadir's participation in a demonstration against the Grand Prix reveals the true face of Quebec Solidaire: a party that wants to curb the economy and employment, "pursued Mr. Bérubé. 
He deplores the participation of the member for Quebec Solidaire for this event. "Amir Khadir should work for the city's economy of Montreal. Without a doubt, several traders and citizens of his constituency benefit from the Grand Prix of Montreal. Mr. Khadir should stop harming them, "concluded Pascal Bérubé.
