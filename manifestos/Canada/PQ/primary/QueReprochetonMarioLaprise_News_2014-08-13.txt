Quebec, August 13, 2014 - The member for Matane-Matapédia and the official opposition on public safety, Pascal Bérubé, is referred to the true reasons for the departure of the Director General of the Security of Quebec (SQ) , Mario Laprise. 
"The Minister Lise Thériault plays on the words. What exactly criticizes Mario Lapise? He had the mandate to collaborate with UPAC and the Charbonneau commission, which obviously gave results. Do the ongoing investigations of the Liberal Party have influenced the decision? The question should be asked, "said Pascal Bérubé. 
It should be remembered that the Liberal Party had supported a motion adopted unanimously on June 13 and reiterating the confidence of Parliament towards, in particular, the Director General of the SQ, Mario Lapise. Pascal Bérubé believes that despite the last spring crisis, the way Lise Thériault manages his ministry is still bad. "Did the minister have found Mario Lapise a scapegoat for his chaotic management of the prisoners' escape from the Orsoinville Detention Center? , Continued the spokesman. 
A lack of transparency in the mode of appointment will also deplore that Minister Thériault has announced a committee whose members have been appointed by the Council of Ministers. "The Prime Minister had promised transparency. However, the appointment process, as well as the creation of the Committee and its composition, all of this has been decided behind closed doors, without any consultation by parliamentarians. Once again, the Liberal government broke one of its promises, "concluded Pascal Bérubé.
