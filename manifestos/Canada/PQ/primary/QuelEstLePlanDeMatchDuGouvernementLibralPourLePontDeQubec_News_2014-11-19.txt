Quebec- The member for Vachon and sentence of the official transport in terms of transport, Martine Ouellet, and the member for Taschereau, a parliamentary leader and spokesman responsible for the Capitale-Nationale region, Agnès Maltese, ask Liberal government to say what is its match plan for the painting of the Quebec Bridge. 
"Minister Robert Poëti taught us yesterday that he had sent a letter to CN to signify the company that he would like to see a settlement for the painting of the Quebec Bridge. Does the minister really think that a letter of wishes on his part will convince CN? Instead, it should contact his federal counterpart to settle the problem that Ottawa has created himself when he has sold the rights of the CN bridge at his privatization in 1995, "said Martine Ouellet. 
"The Prime Minister said, in the election campaign, that it was a shame to see the" halved half and half-painted "bridge. While the file gets bogged down, in addition to writing to CN, does the government have a strategy? Will he contact Minister Denis Lebel to see if a legislative amendment could make sure to protect our national heritage? "Agnès Maltais concluded.
