Quebec- The member for Jonqui√®re and Official Opposition Leader, Sylvain Gaudreault, asked the Prime Minister to clearly detail the concrete actions that the Liberal government intends to implement to increase academic success, while self-proclaimed Prime Minister of Education. He did not obtain a satisfactory answer. 
"The Prime Minister still has the pellet, after the disaster of the last two years in education, to dare to assert before Quebeckers that he is the Prime Minister of Education. The liberal years are cups by hundreds of millions in the network of education, service reductions in homework assistance, hundreds of professionals less, an increase in the budget at the bottom of inflation, this which is less than the average of the last 10 years. And it is a government that annoyed in a structural debate for, finally, recognize its failure. In short, impossible to imagine worst assessment in education, not to mention that there were three ministers in two years, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
"The network has 250 professionals less since the arrival of the Liberals. These are front-line speakers to fight against stall; In this area, there is no more concrete way to act than theirs. The Prime Minister could make a first gesture and tell us how many of these 250 professionals will be re-engaged next September to help our young people most likely to win. I asked him the question, he refused to answer it. His words of the last days are definitely only words, "added the leader of the official opposition. 
Two years lost in structural debates  How many young people did we lose in the years when the Liberal Party plunged the network into a structural debate, an entirely useless exercise, like the Prime Minister itself admits? How many additional dropouts does Quebec expect due to the improvisation of the government? Despite all he can say, the Prime Minister has no credibility when it comes to the academic success of Quebec children, "concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
