Quebec- MP Carole Poirier, spokesperson for the Quebecois on international relations, as well as Maka Kotto, spokesperson for immigration and cultural communities, and Stéphane Bergeron, spokesperson for Quebec relations? Canada, deplore that the federal government refused to grant Canadian citizenship at RAIF Badawi, while last June, the Quebec government issued its certificate of selection from Quebec. 
"In December, Federal Minister Stéphane Dion demanded clemency to the imprisoned blogger. Justin Trudeau claimed for his part that his willingness to solve the case of Raif Badawi was unwavering. He even spoke to appeal to the king of Saudi Arabia! Today, he says that relations between Canada and Saudi Arabia, including an important weapons contract, be compromised if Canada gave the status of citizen to Mr. Badawi. What happened? ", Asked Carole Poirier. 
"How can Ottawa hold such a speech? It's absurd and far away from signals many times sent by Quebeckers. Since the imprisonment of Raif Badawi, those who have also shown their support, as well as his family, established in Sherbrooke. What more is needed to move, in Ottawa? , Brought Maka Kotto. 
Stéphane Bergeron adds that the Minister of Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Jean? Marc Fournier, must act quickly and clearly know the federal government that it must follow the PAS in Quebec, which has already made exceptional measures to repatriate RAIF Badawi. "We ask Justin Trudeau's government to demonstrate diligence and compassion in this case. Besides, what is his strategy for releasing Raif Badawi? Does he have a plan? This fall, Justin Trudeau had committed to put pressure on Saudi Arabia. What does he expect? ", Concluded the member.
