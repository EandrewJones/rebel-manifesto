Quebec- The Minister of the Family, Ms. Nicole Léger, announces that as a result of positive and fruitful discussions, an agreement was concluded with the Quebec Council for Childcare Educational Services (CQSgee). This agreement relates to the budget redevelopment measures provided for in the Network of Early Childhood Centers (CEP) for the 2013-2014 fiscal year. 
"In recent weeks, we have been open to our partners by forming a working group to enable them to offer other solutions. This approach allows us today to announce an agreement with the CQSgee. Throughout these discussions, it was essential to remain firm on the objectives of the budget redevelopment for 2013-2014, while remaining open on the views expressed and flexible on the means, "said Minister Nicole Léger. 
The agreement entered into by the government and the CQSGee ensures that the department puts in place a greater recovery of cumulative CPE surpluses and that the Funding Schedule for 4-year-olds is abandoned. In addition, a consultation table will be created with the purpose of ensuring the sustainability and optimization of CPE funding. 
"This is good news for all because we reach the requested budget goal and we accept the proposed amenities. CPEs play a vital role in our society, the creation of the 28,000 places by 2016 continues and remains a priority for our government, "said Minister Nicole Light.
