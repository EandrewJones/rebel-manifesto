Québec- The Minister of the Family, Ms. Nicole Léger, announces that an agreement in principle was concluded with the gathering of private child care (RGPQ). This agreement relates to the budgetary redevelopment measures provided for in the subsidized child care network for the 2013-2014 fiscal year. 
"As a result of discussions held in a positive climate, the RGPQ has clearly demonstrated a willingness to untie the current situation. A reasonable development proposal was made by its representatives to meet the target of $ 14.9 million this year. After analysis, I accepted this development, "said Minister Nicole Léger. 
[Recall that this effort is for 2013-2014 only, that the funding scale for four-year-olds is abandoned and that subsidized daycares were able to participate in the targeted project call to quickly create a maximum of 1,000 new places From next fall.

"It has always been essential for us to stay firm on the target of 14.9 million in 2013-2014, but open to dialogue on possible developments. Subsidized daycares are important government partners. By maintaining a respectful dialogue, we agreed on an agreement that is good news for all, "said Minister Nicole Light.
