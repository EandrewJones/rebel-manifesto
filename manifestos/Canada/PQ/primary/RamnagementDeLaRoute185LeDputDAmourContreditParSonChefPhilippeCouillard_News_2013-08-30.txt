Quebec- During a radio interview on the margin of the Liberal Caucus this morning, the leader of the Liberal Party of Quebec, Philippe Couillard, confirmed the words of the Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the territory, Sylvain Gaudreault. 
During this interview on the sheaves of Sky-FM, Mr. Couillard affirmed that "at the time of construction, the plans and quotes finished, there, you make the budget for the stretch that remains", confirming as well as the Former Government had not invested a penny in the completion of the redevelopment of the road 185, between Saint-Antonin and Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!. 
"In addition to demonstrating a deep misunderstanding of work planning at the MTQ, Philippe Couillard confirms the sad reality that the former Liberal government has tried to conceal somehow for several months. The sums for this portion of the redevelopment of Highway 185 were not at the rendezvous, despite the statements by the member for Rivière-du-Loup-Témiscouata, Jean d'Amour, "says Minister Gaudreault. 
Mr. Gaudreault has also sent a letter to the hon. Member for Love yesterday asking him to rectify the facts concerning the project to redevelop Route 185 while reiterating the Government of Quebec's willingness to finalize the work. 
"In front of the comments of his leader, the hon. Member for Love must give the public time and to collaborate in good faith to walk this important issue for the citizens of Bas-Saint-Laurent," concluded the Minister of Transport.
