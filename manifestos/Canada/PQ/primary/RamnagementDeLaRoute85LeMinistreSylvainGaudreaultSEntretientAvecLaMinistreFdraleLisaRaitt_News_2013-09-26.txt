I shared my counterpart of funding and security issues surrounding the implementation of Phase 3 of the Route 85 redevelopment between Saint-Antonin and Saint-Louis-du-Ha! -Ha!. This project is important for the Government of Quebec, but above all for the people of Bas-Saint-Laurent, "said Minister Gaudreault. 
Remember that the Government of Quebec is still waiting for the modalities of application of infrastructure funding from Ottawa. This is an essential condition for the realization of this last phase. 
"I also mentioned Ms. Raitt that I heard also discuss the file with his colleague Minister, Mr. Denis Lebel on September 27 in Gatineau on the occasion of a ministerial meeting. We make this file a priority, "concluded Mr. Gaudreault.
