Alma- The Government of Quebec is disappointed with the summary review of the Supreme Court which leaves many unanswered questions. 
Significant violations of the basic democratic principles have been raised by Professor Bastien and the Quebec government intends to respond to the unanimous motion of the National Assembly claiming that all the light be made on the events that led to the proclamation of the Constitution Act, 1982. 
The Quebec government will formulate further comments on Monday.
