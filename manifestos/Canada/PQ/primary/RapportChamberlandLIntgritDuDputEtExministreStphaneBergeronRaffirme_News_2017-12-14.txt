Quebec, on December 14, 2017- Following the tabling of the Locommission Report on the Protection of the Confidentiality of Journalistic Sources, the Leader of the Official Opposition, Jean-François Lisé, wanted to make the following statement: 
"The Commission has clearly validated the version of the facts constantly reiterated by our colleague deputy of Verchères, Stéphane Bergeron, about a police investigation initiated by the security of Quebec in September 2013. Then Minister of Public Safety, Mr. Bergeron acted with the transparency and integrity that all recognize and exercised any political pressure on the police officers, contrary to what some have claimed, without being able to provide the evidence. 
The report is very precise on this point: "There is no conclusive evidence here to say that an elected official has intervened to ask to institute, suspend or abandon a criminal investigation, or to give any directive whatsoever relative to such an investigation. " 
To the Parti Québécois, we have always argued that the integrity of our colleague was flawless and are pleased to see this conviction validated by the Chamberland Commission. On the merits of the proposals, we will focus on the report. However, from the outset, we indicate our full openness to collaborate to improve the protection of journalistic sources, for the good and health of our democratic society. »
