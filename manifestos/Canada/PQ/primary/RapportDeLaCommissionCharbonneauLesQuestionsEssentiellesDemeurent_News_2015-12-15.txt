The other opposition parties, too, asked them to hear the commissioners. "The questions posed by Quebeckers remain whole. You have to go to the bottom of things. All the light should be made on the reasons that pushed Renaud Lachance to dissociate from the France Charbonneau report, especially with respect to the financing of the Liberal Party of Quebec, "said Bernard Drainville. 
"The commission of inquiry lasted more than 4 years and does not happen to unanimous conclusions on an essential part of its mandate, the financing of political parties. It's not commonplace. We must do everything to understand what happened and ensure that this exercise, which has cost $ 45 million to Quebeckers, allow the truth, "concluded the spokesperson.
