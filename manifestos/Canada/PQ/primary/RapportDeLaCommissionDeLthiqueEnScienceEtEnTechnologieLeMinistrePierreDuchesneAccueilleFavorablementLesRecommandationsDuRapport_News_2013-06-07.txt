Quebec- The Minister of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology, Mr. Pierre Duchesne, welcomes the recommendations of the Committee on Ethics in Science and Technology on Government Research in Quebec . 
The report clearly demonstrates that relations between the federal government and its researchers are very tense both in terms of media communications and in carrying out their research, the subject being well documented. In Quebec, the situation is far from being as binding, mentions the Commission, "but we are not immune to questionable practices," said Minister Duchesne. 
The minister has read the report that suggests these measures: 
"The recommendations made by the Commission deserve to be studied. I intend to consider them in the context of the national research and innovation policy that is currently being drafted. The idea of a code of conduct specific to research is attractive. In addition, we will go further to recognize the role of researchers in the Quebec state analysis by seeing how we could enable them to use government data for research purposes, "said Minister Duchesne. 
With regard to the federal situation, Minister Duchene said: "I am dismissed by the situation of researchers in Ottawa as illustrated in the report. Tensions are strong between researchers and the federal government that prevents them from speaking. Moreover, the Information Commissioner of Canada, Ms. Suzanne Legault, agreed to open an investigation into the allegations of federal scientists who claim to be muzzled by the Canadian government. " 
The Ministry of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology is developing its PNRI. This policy will be the result of many consultations with actors from all sectors involved in research and innovation: companies, educational institutions, state and society. PNRA will make it possible to advance Quebec in the society of knowledge and innovation.
