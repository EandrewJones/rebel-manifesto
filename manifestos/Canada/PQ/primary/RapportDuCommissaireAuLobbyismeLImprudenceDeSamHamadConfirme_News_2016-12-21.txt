Quebec, on December 21, 2016 - At the light of the findings of the Commissioner's investigation of first tech lobbying, the Quebec party's speech on ethics and integrity, Agnès Maltais, reiterated that Sam Hamad can not not be renamed at the Council of Ministers. 
"After the ethics commissioner and the ethics, who pointed out that Sam Hamad had committed" a breach of the values of righteousness, convenience, wisdom and justice of the National Assembly ", it is now the Commissioner Lobbying announced that three offense findings have been served in connection with its first tech investigation. This report is another nail in the political coffin of Sam Hamad, who claimed to return to the Council of Ministers, "says Agnès Maltese. 
"This is another evidence than contrary to the Prime Minister last fall, the ethical problems of the Quebec Liberal Party are not the thing of the past. Since the beginning of his mandate, Philippe Couillard is constantly confronted with shortcomings in this area, "added the speech. 
The lobbyism commissioner pronounced: in the first tech case, the ex? Liberal fundraiser Marc? Yvan side did illegal lobbying; He took advantage of Sam Hamad's ethical spreads - then Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, then Minister of Transport - to influence him unduly. "This observation confirms, once again, that Mr. Hamad has contravened the basic ethical principles for the management of public funds. The ethics commissioner and ethics had reached the same conclusion in his June 2016 report, said Agnès Maltais. Sam Hamad lost all credibility; He can not in any way reintegrate the Council of Ministers. »
