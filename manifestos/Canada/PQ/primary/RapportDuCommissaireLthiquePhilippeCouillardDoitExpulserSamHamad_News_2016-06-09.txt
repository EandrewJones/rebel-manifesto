Quebec- reacting to the report of the ethics commissioner and the ethics on the case Sam Hamad, the spokesman of the Quebecois party on ethics and integrity, Bernard Drainville, takes note of his conclusion, according to which Sam Hamad has committed "a breach of the values of righteousness, convenience, wisdom and justice of the National Assembly". 
"In front of a second overwhelming report on the grant granted to the first tech under the authority of Sam Hamad, the Prime Minister has no choice but to expel his member from the Caucus. The Commissioner writes that the "behavior of Mr. Hamad is not simply imprudence, but constitutes a failure that undermines the maintenance of the confidence of the population to the members of the National Assembly". For his part, Sam Hamad no longer has legitimacy to continue sitting as a member of Parliament. If he refuses to resign, all the elected officials, all Quebeckers will come out, "said Bernard Drainville. 
However, the ethics commissioner, who "does not affect the many elements that cause serious questions about the possibility that Mr. Sam Hamad has placed in a situation of conflict of interest", "does not submit any Recommendation as for a sanction that could be imposed ". 
"The Prime Minister therefore has all the latitude desired to crack down against his member. Philippe Couillard must expel Sam Hamad from the caucus. It is the credibility of the National Assembly which is at stake, "concluded the spokesperson.
