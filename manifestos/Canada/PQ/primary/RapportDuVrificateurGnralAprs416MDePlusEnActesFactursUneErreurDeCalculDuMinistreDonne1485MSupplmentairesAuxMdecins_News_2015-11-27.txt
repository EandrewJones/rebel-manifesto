Qu√©bec- The member for Taillon and spokesman for the Quebecois health and accessibility of care, Diane Lamarre, denounces additional privileges still granted to doctors by the Minister of Health. 
The Auditor General's report confirms that the Liberal government offers gift after gift to doctors, without getting any improvement in access to care. It is $ 416 million more than expected that have been paid to them: $ 32 million to family physicians and $ 384 million to specialists. 
"In summary, the amounts paid to the doctors have exceeded the amounts planned, and the exceedances have therefore had to be assumed to the envelopes of the other programs. Meanwhile, the health network undergoes 220 million cuts for the year 2014-2015 and $ 450 million for 2015-2016. Public health, prevention, home care, social services - and I've passed it - have been eradicated to pay $ 416 million from extras to physicians, "said the member. 
The Auditor General also concludes that the Minister Barrette took advantage of spreading agreements to add, without the knowledge of all, $ 148.5 million for doctors. How can he dare to give them even more? It will never be enough. The Minister of Health overrated $ 148.5 million with remuneration increases in spreading, rising he had negotiated himself with Philippe Couillard in 2007, and with Yves Bolduc in 2011. 
"In short, the Minister Barrette has cheaply granted an umpteenth raising of compensation to physicians. No economy for the government, no more access for patients, but $ 416 million more for doctors. Is that, the liberal solution to improve access? Unfortunately for patients, there has been nothing for them for 18 months, and they will still have to wait, "concluded the member.
