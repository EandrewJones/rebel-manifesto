Quebec- The spokesperson for the Quebec's information resources, Guy Leclair, finds that once more, in an overwhelming report, the Auditor General highlights the serious gaps in the process of granting computing contracts. government. 
Unveiled this morning, the Auditor General's report is devastating about the management of computing contracts by the government. This is the third to sound the alarm. It reads that the independence and impartiality of the selection committees are not ensured, that suppliers assume only a small portion of the risks because of the structure of the contracts, that the terms of the contracts, often, are not respected and that the recourse to private is generalized, even when it comes to a strategic decision. In short, the Auditor General believes that the government does not have control. As a result, Quebeckers must assume increased costs, "denounced Guy Leclair. 
In order to solve the problem once and for all, the Parti Québécois asks the Government to set up a study commission on IT contracts in Quebec. " Hurry up. Quebeckers have already seen enough of their money being engulfed in the unfunderstanding wells that have become IT contracts. A study commission would allow us to understand why it's wrong, why the government ended up completely dependent on external expertise, why does it cost Quebeckers so expensive, and to find solutions, "added the member for Beauharnois . 
"I invite the Liberal government to act now. If he refuses to set up this study commission, Quebeckers will understand, like us, that he probably has something to hide or someone to protect ", has concluded Guy Leclair.
