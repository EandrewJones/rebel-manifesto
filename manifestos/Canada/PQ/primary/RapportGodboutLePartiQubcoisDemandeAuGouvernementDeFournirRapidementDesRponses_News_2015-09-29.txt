"We learned yesterday that two experts, economists and university professors question the findings of the report of the Quebec Taxation Review Board; According to them, these conclusions are based on calculations that have not been demonstrated. These warnings are extremely serious and commands that all light be done, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
Recall that economists at the origin of this warning, André Lemelin and Bernard Decaluwé, have participated actively in the design and implementation of a calculation model used by the Ministry of Finance, among other things to assess the benefits of The reform proposed in the GODBOUT report in terms of job creation and increased GDP. 
"Now, these two experienced economists question the minister's estimates and the relevance of tax reform, claiming that they can conclude that the forecasts are reliable because in the GODBOUT report, several essential information is not unveiled", continued the spokesperson.
