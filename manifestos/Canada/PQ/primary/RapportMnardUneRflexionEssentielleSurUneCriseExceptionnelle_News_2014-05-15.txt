Quebec- The member for Matane-Matapédia and official opposition on public safety, Pascal Bérubé, takes note of the Special 2012 Spring Event Review Commission, which makes significant findings about a crisis exceptional. He invites the government to follow up by carefully analyzing the recommendations made there. 
"The Liberals did not want the commission. The searched and substantial report she has handed over, however, that all stakeholders become aware of it. The Couillard government has the duty to follow up. We could not save this kind of reflection. It is not a matter of calling into question the work of the police; The report goes well beyond and encourages us to a much broader analysis exercise, "said Pascal Bérubé. 
The report issues different recommendations on the tools made available to the police community, as well as the organization and training of police officers. There are also findings about groups of protesters and the various organizations that have to intervene in many ways in the scene of a demonstration. 
Pascal Bérubé particularly attracts the attention of the government to the last lines of the report. The government is invited to take advantage of the period of accaltimia to "bring together all the actors concerned in order to agree on a new democratic framework of the right to the peaceful event". 
"This consultation is essential to coordinate the actions of all stakeholders: the police community, emergency services and protesters. The right to demonstrate peacefully is a recognized right in our society; Take the time to review all its aspects, "concluded the member for Matane-Matapédia.
