Quebec- The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the Territory, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, denounces the comments of the leader of the Liberal Party of Quebec, Mr. Philippe Couillard, who in a press point yesterday, Biecked the observations released in the Report of the Secor-KPMG Firm on the Management of Additional Expenditure on Service and Construction Contracts of certain public bodies. 
"The words of Philippe Couillard are an illustration that the more it changes the more to the PLQ. Even laxity, even trivialization of an organizational culture that led to an explosion of additional costs in projects at the MTQ. The PLQ made the bulletin overwhelming in its own management that this report represents, "deplored Minister Gaudreault. 
"Under the Liberal regime, the additional costs literally exploded from 68 extras in 2009 to 159 in 2012. Total of these additional costs: $ 309 million. Nevertheless, the new leader of the PLQ takes everything lightly. I find Mr. Couillard's attitude and irresponsible, "said Minister Gaudreault. 
"Our government is committed to putting the necessary gestures to reduce rigor and integrity in the management of public funds. We are in action to bring this necessary change of culture to the MTQ but also throughout the public apparatus. The creation of a transport agency is at the heart of this approach "concluded Mr. Gaudreault. 
In March 2013, the Government of Quebec mandated the Secor-KPMG firm to shed light on the cost overruns of construction contracts and professional services of three major public bodies, the Ministry of Transport, the Quebec Real Estate Corporation and The Shared Services Center of Quebec.
