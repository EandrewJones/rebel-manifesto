Québec-The member for Blainville and the official opposition on the municipal affairs, Daniel Rathedé, believes that the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Laurent Lessard, must quickly file a proposal that would change the criteria of representativeness. 
"Given the reflection began in several municipal councils on representativeness, we believe that it belongs to Minister Lessard to present to the National Assembly a proposal for amendments to the criteria and must proceed quickly so that the debate. Primer from this fall, "said Daniel Ratthé. 
Last week in parliamentary committee, Minister Laurent Lessard opened the door to change the criteria of representativity. "These criteria have not been reviewed since 1987. It is in the order of things to adapt our laws to the new realities of today, added the regatta deputy. However, to access municipal requests for the reduction in the number of elected officials, we can not do so without the clear support expressed by the population, the highly majority willingness of the municipal councils and the respect of the criteria that will be set out in the law " , insists the spokesman for the Parti Québécois. 
The hon. Member for Blainville also points out that this issue is imperative to be addressed right now to amend the municipal districts, if any. If Minister Lessard does not move quickly, it will be too late for these changes to be effective at the next municipal election in 2013. "The population would not understand that the government pushes back to the 2017 municipal elections, in six years, the fruit. A reflection that is quite advanced in many municipalities currently, "continued the member. 
For the Parti Québécois, the Liberal government must allow these changes to all municipalities on this crucial issue of representativeness because the exceptional laws can not become the norm. "The ball is in the camp of Minister Lessard," concluded Daniel Ratthé.
