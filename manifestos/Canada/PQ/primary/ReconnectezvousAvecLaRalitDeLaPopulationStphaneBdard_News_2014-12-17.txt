Quebec- The member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, invites the Liberal government to take advantage of the holidays to reconnect with the population. Indeed, in the light of the end-of-year interviews of the Prime Minister, he considers that he has adopted the tactic of denial of reality, even more from the families, regions and workers of Quebec. 
"Far from the reality of their environment and everyone in his turn, ministers govern enclosed vas. They do not talk to partners and maintain an atmosphere of permanent confrontation in all sectors. We all remember the social tension climates created from all parts by the Liberals, and we do not want to replay in this bad movie. The priority of ministers must be to contact families, regions and workers. Reconnect with the reality of the population! Stéphane Bédard said. 
An amazing admission 
The leader of the official opposition also points out that the Prime Minister made an amazing admission, according to which it is the New York credit agencies that control the public finances of Quebec. Moreover, Philippe Couillard says they rely on the report of the Auditor General. However, we know today that this report is not credible, since it is based on theoretical figures. 
"The Prime Minister must assume that the state of Quebec's indebtedness and the bad budget choices, they are largely due to the reign of nine-year-olds of the Liberal government, of which it was part. That he assumes his responsibilities and choices now. Families and regions of Quebec do not have to pay for the bad decisions of Philippe Couillard, "concluded Stéphane Bédard.
