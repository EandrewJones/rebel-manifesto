The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the Territory, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, is pleased to announce that today start the work of a third project for the reconstruction of the Route 112 between Thetford Mines and Saint-Joseph-de-Coleraine. 
"The start of this third site certainly confirms that the rebuilding of Route 112 is on the right track. This new construction is added to the other two already in progress, the work of rubbing the Haldes and the construction of the bridge that spans the Bécancour River. In addition, these two sites started last August follow their course and are progressing, "said Minister Sylvain Gaudreault. 
The work will take place in the wooded sector, located in the western part of the route and this, for a length of 5.4 kilometers. The work will be to carry out earthmoving, drainage, asphalting, retaining devices, landscaping and road lighting of the intersection with Lake Caribou Road. 
It should be remembered that with the goal of accelerating the construction of the new section, the project is divided into four sections, which will be worked simultaneously. Indeed, from west east, the wooded sectors (5.4 km), mining (4 km), from the Bécancour and Urban River Bridge (1 km) will be treated independently. The goal remains that the new route 112 is functional in the fall of 2015.
