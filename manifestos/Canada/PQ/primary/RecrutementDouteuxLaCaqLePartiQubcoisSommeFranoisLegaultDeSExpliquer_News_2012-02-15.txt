Quebec- The member for Chambly and Deputy Leader of the Official Opposition, Bertrand St-Arnaud, François Legault to be explained on the supply he makes to the Calculative aspirants during his recruitment interviews. 
In a report broadcast on Radio-Canada last week, a candidate approached by CAQ admits without detour to have been offered a job in the public service, from its first interview. "Not only does it come out the arrogance of François Legault, but in addition, it is contrary to the law that provides for hiring in the public service is made by competition. With the CAQ of François Legault, the expertise of the public service would take the edge and it is the political affiliation that would take, "denounced Bertrand St-Arnaud. 
The hon. Member recalls that section 42 of the Public Service Act is clear: civil servants are recruited and promoted by competition. "We can read and reread the law as we want, nowhere it is mentioned that a party leader has the opportunity to offer a job in the public service when recruiting on the eve of a campaign election ", adds the member for Chambly. 
For the Québécois Party, such contempt for Quebec's laws is worrying on the part of a political party that supports doing things properly. "This dubious recruitment campaign brings us 50 years back under the Duplessis era. Patronage, Quebeckers do not want it. François Legault can not hide as he did with his financing just as questionable. He must be explained, "concluded Bertrand St-Arnaud.
