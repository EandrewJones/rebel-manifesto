Montreal, February 1, 2017- Team members of the Québécois SME priority, MPs Alain Therien (Sanguinet), Mireille Jean (Chicoutimi) and Martin Ouellet (René? Lévesque), are worried about the decline in Quebec exports. in the United States for the year 2016. 
"Data published yesterday by Desjardins indicate that our exports to the United States declined 3.5% in 2016. The inaction of the Couillard government has made an opportunity to grow our exports, while the context was favorable . Indeed, the American administration saw the free trade of a good eye, the American demand increased steadily, and the exchange rate was advantageous for us. In short, this decline is another failure to add to the already embarrassing economic newsletter of the Liberal government, "said Alain Therien. 
"The Minister of Economy, Dominique Anglade, has only a meager $ 25 million to help SMEs export; It's clearly insufficient. SMEs are at the heart of the Quebec economy, and they need more muscular measures to support them in their efforts in international markets, particularly in the United States, "continued Mireille Jean. 
A particular sector must be a priority for the government, according to the Parti Québécois. "Quebec must claim the inclusion of timber in any negotiations related to the reopening of NAFTA. In order for the economy of our regions to restart, we must, among other things, encourage the growth of our exports of timber, "said, in closing, Martin Ouellet.
