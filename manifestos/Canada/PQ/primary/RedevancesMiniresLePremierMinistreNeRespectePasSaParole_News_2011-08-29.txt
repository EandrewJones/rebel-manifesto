Québec -Alors that Prime Minister Jean Charest said last May to the journalist Alexandre Shields of the duty he was "ready to debate" of the question of mining royalties and that the fall would certainly be a good time to do it, he said exactly the opposite right now on the margins of his trip to Asia. 
"It's aberrant that the Prime Minister comes back on his word. Bill 14 is the occasion par excellence to establish a royaltime regime that will ensure that Quebeckers get richer and instead, Jean Charest prefers to do nothing, "lamented the spokesman for the Official opposition in terms of mines and MP from Vachon, Martine Ouellet. 
"Why does the Prime Minister come back to his word? Is it in order to amaad Chinese investors by making them mirror natural resources virtually free? "Asked the hon. Member. 
The Parti Québécois proposes to find the maximum of mining royalties by setting up a mandatory royalty on gross income, without tax deduction, while establishing a fair sharing of overprofit, as the Australians do. In addition, the Parti Québécois proposes to take strategic catch of participation in mining companies as already done Newfoundland and Norway for oil. 
"Nothing has been settled since the deposit of the devastating report of the Auditor General. Of the four billion gross revenues carried out by the Quebec mining industry in 2009-2010, the Quebec government received only 23 million net rights. Nearly half of Quebec mining (7 out of 18) does not pay any royalty because they make no proficiency after the application of all tax deductions. 12% zero dollar equal zero dollar. Even if the government increases this percentage at 16%, it will always zero dollar! It is unacceptable! It must change and fast! We do not have the means to deprive us of these income, whatever in France Charest thought, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
