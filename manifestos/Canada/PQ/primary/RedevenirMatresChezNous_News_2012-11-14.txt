Quebec- The Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Daniel Breton, wanted to emphasize today the fiftieth anniversary of the election of the Government of Jean Lesage, whose slogan was: " Masters in your own house ". Since then, this expression has become emblematic of the quiet revolution and the entry of Quebec in modernity. 
Recall that the 1962 election kicked off a project that would become a turning point in Quebec's history: the nationalization of electricity. This vast construction site has brought with him a wind of renewal that has greatly contributed to forge the Quebec identity. It is today a source of inspiration for many Quebecers for whom it symbolizes the spirit of entrepreneurship, the sense of innovation and the brand of a young and bold nation. 
"Even after all these years, it's the same spirit that runs today our government. It is time to reclaim our inheritance and become the true fiduciaries of our natural and energy resources. We all know that Quebec has incredible potential; It is therefore natural that Quebeckers are the first beneficiaries, "said the minister. 
"Unlike our predecessors, we take the bet to bet on Quebec and its many resources. This is why we want to end all the uncertainties related to northern development. We want a "North for All", which will benefit society as a whole, rather than a few foreign multinationals. This second phase of the masters among us will also go through the acquisition of greater energy independence and by the electrification of transport. It is this vision that will allow us to become masters home, "concluded the minister.
