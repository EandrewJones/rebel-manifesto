Quebec- The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, is satisfied with the decision of the Supreme Court, which welcomes the Quebec's request to appeal the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Destruction of Quebec Data for the Shoulder Weapons Registry. 
"This authorization from the Supreme Court will allow us to assert our point of view about the law of Quebec to obtain the data of the shoulder registry concerning Quebeckers and Quebeckers. We are also pleased with the decision of the Supreme Court which maintains the obligation to register the data until a final decision is made. This will ensure that the registry will have an up-to-date data and will not become obsolete, the time the Supreme Court makes its decision, "said the Minister of Justice. 
The Court of Appeal, remember, had concluded that the abolition of the Federal Weapons Registry was valid, hence the will of Quebec to appeal this judgment. 
By the case of the Supreme Court makes its decision, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec will reserve his comments, pending the decision of this last court.
