Québec- In the light of this important development that is the discount to justice of Quebec Firearms Register, the member for Verchères and the official opposition spokesperson for Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, Remember the Liberal government again to require the federal government without delation that it gives it this data. 
"We evade today: Quebec data always exists on an external hard drive. The only reason that could explain the refusal of Ottawa to transmit them to us, it is bad faith, "said the member for Verchères. 
Mr. Bergeron recalled that Quebeckers are somehow proprietary to these data, since they paid to collect them. "This is particularly due to taxes and taxes paid by Quebeckers and Quebeckers have been raised the information contained in the federal registry. It is therefore entirely legitimate and desirable to claim them, what the Quebec government would immediately do if it was standing up with Ottawa. The opportunity offered to him today is unexpected and, if he does not grab it, he will have proof of his negligence and his indifference to see Quebeckers pay a second time to collect the same data, " -T he pursued. 
"Do not seek noon at fourteen hours; If the Harper Government has so far refused to submit this data in Quebec, it is for purely ideological reasons, so inadmissible. Prime Minister Couillard and his ministers must now challenge the Canadian government and demand immediate transmission of Quebec data from the Federal Firearms Registry, "concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
