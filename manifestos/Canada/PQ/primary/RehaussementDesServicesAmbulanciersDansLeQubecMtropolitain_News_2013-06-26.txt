I would like to thank the emergency prehospitality of this territory, which has participated very constructively in improving the efficiency of ambulance transport, "said Minister Hébert. 
This territory is served by two ambulanty companies, the cooperative of Quebec paramedic technicians (CTAQ) and Lessercomm. The first will have three more ambulances, allowing it to add 260 hours of service per week. The second, with its current vehicles, can offer 36.5 overtime service per week.
