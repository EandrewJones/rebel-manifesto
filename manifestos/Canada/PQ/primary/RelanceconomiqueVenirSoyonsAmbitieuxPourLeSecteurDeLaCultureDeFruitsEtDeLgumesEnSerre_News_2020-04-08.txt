Quebec, April 8, 2020 - The member for Matane-Matapédia and parliamentary leader of the Parti Québécois, Pascal Bérubé, as well as the hon. Member for Bonaventure and Spokesperson on Agriculture and Food, Sylvain Roy, propose to the Government of the Quebec to launch a large chore to develop the greenhouse growing and vegetable cultivation sector, a lever that can be very beneficial as part of future economic recovery, in many respects. 
IN SHORT 
The current Pandemic of Covid-19 represents a turning point and we force us to rethink our ways of doing things. "Brutally, we realized that we depend a lot - even too - from outside in terms of our supply, especially fruit and fresh vegetables. Quebec must seize the opportunity to correct this flaw; We have everything in human and material resources to develop greenhouse cultivation, a sector of the economy that will create sustainable jobs throughout Quebec, in addition to ensuring the freshness of food, the protection of the environment, the diversification of our agriculture and a reduction of our commercial deficit. As a bonus, it would be a strong gesture in economic nationalism, a certain advantage for all Quebeckers, "said the parliamentary leader of the Parti Québécois. 
The idea is not new, the Parti Québécois. "In May 2013, our government published the food sovereignty. Our goal was to take advantage of the combined knowledge of all the branches of the agri-food sector to promote the products here. Then, at the end of 2018, before the pandemic, we have again wished to increase Quebec greenhouse vegetable production, among others to curb the price of the grocery basket price. To this effect, it would be a promising bet, which could certainly make small in the future. For the government, it would be investing in innovative projects and grant producers a preferential electricity tariff, for example, "illustrated Sylvain Roy.
