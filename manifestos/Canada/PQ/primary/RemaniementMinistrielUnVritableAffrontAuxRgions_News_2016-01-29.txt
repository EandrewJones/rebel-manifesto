Québec- In the aftermath of the ministerial reshuffle by Philippe Couillard, the spokesman of the Parti Party for the development of the regions and deputy of Gaspé, Gaétan Lelièvre, vigorously denounces the total absence of consideration of this government for the regions of the Quebec. "Since the election of the Couillard government, the regions have always been the big losers. The formation of the new Council of Ministers is another demonstration, "he said. 
Of a total of 28 ministers, indeed, only 6 come from constituencies outside the major urban centers, and none of them occupies a key position for the development of the regions - transport, health, education or economic development, for example. 
"The regions are unfortunately once left behind. Even with all its good intentions, how the member for Anjou, the new minister responsible for regional economic development, will she understand the regional reality? In the same way, Martin Coiteux, now at the head of the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and the occupation of the territory, is a member of the metropolitan area. Is it really because of what is happening in the region? , Continued the spokesman. 
Remember that, to their arrival, the Liberals withdrew the word "regions" of the appointment of the Ministry of Municipal Affairs. "It sends the message that for this government, the regions, it's secondary, or even worse. The place they are allowed to decrease continually. It's discouraging. Who will rise, to the Council of Ministers, to defend the regions of Quebec and the citizens who live there? "A concluded Gaétan Lelièvre.
