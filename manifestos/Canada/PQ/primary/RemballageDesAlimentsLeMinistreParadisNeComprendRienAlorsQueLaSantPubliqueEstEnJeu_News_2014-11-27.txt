Quebec- The member for Berthier and official opposition on food, André Villeneuve, are surprised by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Paradis, who wants to prohibit The repackaging of meat in grocery stores, as a result of the broadcast of a report of Radio-Canada on this subject. 
"The minister does not understand anything. The solution it advocates, or to prohibit repackage, purely and simply, would be damaging to food safety. Indeed, by acting thus, the retailers would be prevented from ensuring clean packaging by removing the liquids being passed there. The consumer does not run from risk because of the repacking of the product; What is dangerous is when you change the date indicated on the packaging, "said André Villeneuve. 
The hon. Member recalls that the solution to the situation denounced in the reporting of Radio-Canada is in accordance with the laws and regulations in force. "The problem is that the current law is not always respected. However, the application of the law is the responsibility of the minister. It must ensure that the austerity imposed by his Government will not prevent his department from hurrying a sufficient number of field inspectors to verify whether the law is respected, "he added.
