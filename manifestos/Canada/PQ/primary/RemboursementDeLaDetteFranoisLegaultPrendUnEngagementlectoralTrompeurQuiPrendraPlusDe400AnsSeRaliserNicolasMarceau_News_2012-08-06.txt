Montréal - the Quebec party candidate in the riding of Rousseau, Nicolas Marceau, questions the commitment made today by the Future Québec Coalition (CAQ) to bring Quebec debt to the same level as the other Canadian provinces in ten years. 
"To achieve this promise, François Legault is expected to reimburse $ 81.5 billion over the next ten years. It plans to do so by paying all royalties perceived on non-renewable natural resources, which it does not expected to increase. Mining revenues are estimated at about $ 4 billion over the next decade. The head of the CAQ also plans to affect oil royalties at the repayment of the debt, "he explained, adding that François Legault should know that these sums are hypothetical since no oil company expects to pay royalties. Before 2015, and this, in the best case. 
"François Legault should also remember a basic notion of public finances: half of the royalties collected by the Government of Quebec is retained by the federal government through the equalization system. It is therefore technically impossible to promise to allocate more than half of these royalties as long as the equalization formula is changed, "continued Nicolas Marceau. 
"As a result, to fulfill its commitment, to bring Quebec's debt to the same level as that of other provinces by affecting all royalties perceived on non-renewable resources, it will take over 400 years," concluded Nicolas Marceau. .
