As part of this election campaign, I want to meet as many Quebeckers: in markets, restaurants, festivals, shopping centers and even - Yes! - in the street. 
People come to see me and what I hear more and more often is: "Madame Marois, it does not make sense! Quebec must be given to order! Yes, it's time to replace Quebec on the right track. 
We must give back all its place to French, to our identity; solve the crisis of reasonable accommodations; Repeat our story in schools. 
We must end the student crisis. 
You have to look for the fair share that comes back to the exploitation of our natural resources. 
We must stand in front of the Harper government. 
We must clean one by all corruption nests. 
Obviously, this is not shouting scan. It takes knowledge, you need to know how a government works. It takes a solid team, not just two or three stars without any experience of the state. You need a program containing rigorous measures. And above all, you need a will of iron. 
I listen François Legault and I feel like I've hear Jean Charest in 2003. He promises to make the big household of the state, but everything is completely improvised. He has neither the team nor the experience and changes continuously. 
The choices are clear. If you want a dirty and messy house, choose the Liberal Party. If you want a house without foundation and patchy, choose the coalition. If you want a house in order, choose the Parti Québécois. 
If you think Stephen Harper must choose in our place, you can vote for the CAQ or the PLQ, but if you believe it's up to us to choose, vote for the Parti Québécois. 
We have experience, we have the team, we have ideas. We have especially a will of iron and we have proven it!
