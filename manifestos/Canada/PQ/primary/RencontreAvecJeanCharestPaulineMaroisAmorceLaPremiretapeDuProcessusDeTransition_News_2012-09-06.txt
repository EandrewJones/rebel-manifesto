This meeting allows me to assure Quebeckers that the current government continues to look after current affairs while my government is preparing to take responsibility. » 
The designated first Minister took the opportunity to pay tribute to Mr. Charest and his family who spent 28 years of their lives serving Quebeckers. 
"In the last nine years, Jean Charest will have exercised the demanding position as Prime Minister of Quebec, evidence of the great strength and courage of this outstanding political man. Infatigable traveler, he has been a passionate ambassador of Quebec on the international scene. He defended with energy the Quebec's point of view in the fight against climate change, woven many links with the member countries of the Francophonie and concluded beneficial agreements for Quebec with France, "she mentioned. 
The story will also retain Mr. Charest that he has been a great promoter of equality between women and men. "Anxious to grant an important place to women, he has been able to build a board of joint ministers, which is not a thin feat considering the difficulty always present for women to get involved in politics. We must also welcome Mr. Charest's decision to require parity in the Boards of Directors of Crown corporations, "concluded Pauline Marois, taking advantage of the opportunity to wish Mr. Charest and His wife, Michelle Dionne, and their children the best chance for the future.
