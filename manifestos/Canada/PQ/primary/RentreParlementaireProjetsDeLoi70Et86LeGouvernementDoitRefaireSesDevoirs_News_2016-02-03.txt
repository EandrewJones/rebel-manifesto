Quebec- This morning in the press, Alexandre Cloutier, spokesman for the Education, and Dave Turcotte, spokesperson for employment and solidarity, have made requests to the new ministers of the government Philippe Couillard, as well as the Prime Minister himself: the Liberal government must review its priorities and put aside bills 70 and 86. 
"After removing his cabinet, the Prime Minister must now redefine his priorities for action. While our schools fall into ruins, Quebec continues to accuse a significant degree in graduation and that students are cut across, the Liberal government goes astray with a bill that will not improve the school success. The Minister of Education should put aside Bill 86 and focus on real problems. There is a way to give more power to parents without going through all this brewing of structures, "said Alexandre Cloutier. 
For its part, Dave Turcotte emphasized the importance, for the new Minister of Employment, to clarify his positions. "On one side, Fran√ßois Blais finds himself forced to advocate for a social assistance reform that plans to impose sanctions to the providers, while on the other, he makes the idea of a guaranteed minimum income. In front of such a paradox, Bill 70 must be withdrawn, since it becomes obsolete. That the government redo its duties and that it takes the opportunity to launch the necessary company debate on the guaranteed minimum income, "he claimed. 
Certainly, the parliamentary session that will begin will soon hold the members of the official opposition. "That the government is holding it to say: either it attacks the real priorities that education and employment are, or it will have constantly on the heels. We will call him back, until he hears, that Quebec tomorrow will be rich if today's young people succeed in school and find a job of quality ", have concluded members.
