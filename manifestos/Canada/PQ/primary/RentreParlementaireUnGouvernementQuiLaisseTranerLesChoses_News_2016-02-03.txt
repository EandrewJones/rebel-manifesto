Quebec- On the sidelines of the presensive Caucus of Quebec Party members, the official Leader, Pierre Karl Péladeau, and the parliamentary leader, Bernard Drainville, emphasized the priorities of the Parti Québécois for the next session: the economy, Education and families in Quebec. In addition, in addition to austerity, they also denounced the government's let-make, which has become its habit and trademark. 
"The impacts of the economic inaction of the Government of Philippe Couillard are felt everywhere in Quebec. The indicators are down, jobs as well. There are more unemployed today than at the power of the Liberals. Today, we lose another head office, that of Rona, and the government of the inertia lets it do, once again. The Prime Minister, who is not interested in the economy, persists in inaction. When will we have a real economic development policy? Asked Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"The members of the Parti Québécois will continue to combat this austerity that hurts. We will fight on behalf of families, children, middle-class people and those in the region. Austerity is not a project of society! We will also continue to demand a real economic vision, a real enrichment plan for Quebecers. Our chef, Pierre Karl Péladeau, is the designated person to lead this battle, and to push this government to highlight sustainable solutions rather than letting the problems rot, as it is currently doing, "says Bernard Drainville. 
"We will continue our work on the ground, near Quebeckers, to know their aspirations. That's it, the work of the official opposition. And there is only we to do it everywhere in all regions of Quebec. The economy, education, families will be our priorities for the coming weeks, "concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
