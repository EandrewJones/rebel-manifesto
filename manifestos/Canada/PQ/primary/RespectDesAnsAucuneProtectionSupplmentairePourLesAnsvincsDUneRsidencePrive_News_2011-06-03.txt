Quebec - Member for Crémazie and official opposition spokesperson for seniors, Lapointe Lisette, said Sorry that Bill 22, filed this morning by the Minister responsible for seniors, Marguerite Blais, does not solve any Situations recently reported in the news where seniors have been swallowed riders of Monaco, Dickson and Woode Saint-Aubert residences. 
"The amendments that the minister contribute to the Civil Code by Bill 22 respond to claims that seniors' rights advocate have for years and he had committed to respond almost two years ago. But do not come to the problems we have raised lately, "said Lapointe Lisette. 
"The particular situation of elders evacuated from a private residence that closes or changing vocation remains. This attempt at diversion of recent problems I raised at the question period and in the media illustrates a flagrant lack of respect for the rights of our elders. Situations where seniors have been evinced within deadlines that do not meet the six months of the Civil Code, always constitute a threat of their rights and I deplore that Marguerite Blais does not do anything tangible to further protect the rights of seniors hosted in residence. Private in Quebec, "added Lapointe Lisette. 
The member for Crémazie reiterates that when seniors in loss of autonomy must relocate in disaster, protection guarantees must be put in place so that they can continue to benefit from the same rights as all Quebeckers
