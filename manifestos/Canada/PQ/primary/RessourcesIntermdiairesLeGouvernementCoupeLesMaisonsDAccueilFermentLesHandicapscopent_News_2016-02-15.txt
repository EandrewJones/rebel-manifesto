"The closure of RI-RTF will concretely result in the investment of those who were hosted there, for some since 10, 15, or even 20 years. Why does this government want a return to institutionalization, while these people enjoy, in our RI-RTF, a living environment much more adapted to their needs, in addition to cost a lot less to State an investment in CHSLD? This liberal decision is simply incomprehensible, "denounced the member. 
These are 500 resources that are now undergoing the selective austerity of this government and see their funding cut. "To these cups adds a wave of declassification of the hosted persons who, overnight, see their condition improving themselves, if we believe the assessments made by the authorities of the Ministry of Health. Even today, we have additional examples that illustrate this wave with the sole purpose of reducing the amounts allocated. It is scandalous to note that these cups are carried out in a purely accounting and budgetary goal, regardless of the real needs of households, "added Jean-François Lisée.
