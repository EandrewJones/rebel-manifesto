The partnership with the Religious Heritage Council of Quebec, lasting for almost twenty years, illustrates this commitment. I am convinced that this new agreement corresponds more to the reality and needs of today's heritage protection, "said Maka Kotto. 
Since 1995, the Ministry of Culture and Communications has paid to the Religious Heritage Council of Quebec more than $ 270 million as part of the Quebec Infrastructure Plan. The main mandate of the Council is to support the environment and assume the management of these sums to support and promote the conservation and development of religious heritage of Quebec. 
New cultural heritage dissemination tools are added to the Cultural Heritage Directory of Quebec (RPCQ), allowing to discover all its richness and diversity, making it accessible to all. Part of the RPCQ content is now on the Open Data Portal of the Government of Quebec, atwww.donnes.gouv.qc.ca, as well as on the Social Pinterest network, in the form of virtual exhibitions, AWWW.

The department's contribution comes from the Private Capital Assistance and is part of the 2013-2023 Infrastructure Québécois Framework. Recall that this ten-year plan will eventually result in $ 2 billion investments for the cultural component. It will have a major economic impact throughout Québec, with nearly 60,000 jobs created or maintained, on average, per year.
