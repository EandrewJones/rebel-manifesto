Quebec, October 29, 2014 - The member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and the official opposition for international relations, Carole Poirier, deplores the diplomatic setback of the Prime Minister of Quebec in China. 
"Philippe Couillard has just failed their first major economic mission abroad. Several experts have evaluated that the Prime Minister, trying to sell Quebec pork to the world's largest pork producer, has committed a major diplomatic blunder. This testifies to total ignorance of the file, "said Carole Poirier. 
The Université de Montréal course officer, and specialist in Chinese issues, Loïc tackled, considers that: 
"Mr. Couillard does indeed come to lose his face in China in a public exchange with the governor of the powerful Shandong Province. 
He wanted to defend the pig producers in Quebec by asking Shandong to facilitate imports of pork meat from Quebec. Except that China is the largest producer of pigs in the world. [...] 
Conclusion: Mr. Couillard is poorly surrounded, or he is poorly prepared, or both. » 
The member also deplores that the Prime Minister has doubled his wrongs of an affront, publicly stating that he was "not surprising that the governor is not aware of the routing problems." Shortly after, the Minister of the Economy, Jacques Daoust added, claiming that the Chinese had misunderstood what Quebec had come to offer them. 
"What is even more serious than the first minister's bout is his lack of respect for the Chinese authorities. He must make amends honorable and apologize. He goes to China to support our businesses, to facilitate their entry into the Chinese market; It's certainly not losing the face there that he will help them get there. It is the image of Quebec that is tainted, and this, by its fault, "concluded Carole Poirier.
