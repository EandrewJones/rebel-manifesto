Quebec- The Quebec Party Spokesperson for Education, Research and School Perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, questions the real benefits on student success that the reform of school governance proposed by the Liberal government. Faced with the concerns and legitimate questions raised by Bill 86, the official opposition calls for general consultations to ensure that all stakeholders have the chance to decide on the content of the reform. 
"The Minister of Education will have to demonstrate that this brewing of structures will bring real benefits favoring the academic success of Quebec students. At this point, the proof is far from being made. The bill also raises several serious issues and concerns. This is why general consultations appear unavoidable, "said Alexandre Cloutier. 
In the eyes of the Parti Québécois, the establishment of a two-speed school democracy - where some citizens will be right to vote to elect the members of their school board and others, not, according to the regions - raises several questions immediately . The same applies to the granting of a tax of taxation to a school board not elected by universal suffrage, a situation that involves a basic democratic principle: "No taxation without representation". 
In addition, the extent of the new powers conferred on the Minister of Education, as well as the functioning of the new resource distribution committees, will require clarification. 
Finally, Alexandre Cloutier deplores the time chosen for the filing of the bill. "The Government has deliberately decided to file a major reform on the last day of a parliamentary session to avoid having to answer the opposition questions to the National Assembly. He tries to walnut the fish in this day of balance sheets. Such a way to make a testament to a lack of respect for the democratic process, "he concluded.
