Québec- In the case of the reform of emergency prehospital services, Diane Lamarre, Member of Parliament for Taillon and spokesman for the Quebecois health and accessibility of care, is questioned on the intentions of the Minister of Health, Gaétan barrette; It calls for a transparent plan, with respect for patients and employees in the ambulance sector. 
"The Ouellet Report, commissioned by the Parti Québécois, was given to the Minister of Health in June 2014. He was entitled prehospital services: urgency to act. The message was no longer clear. However, the minister took several months before appointing, in February 2015, an implementation committee of the recommendations. The report highlighted serious gaps, including the absence of a culture of performance and accountability, despite the hundreds of millions of public money that are invested to ensure emergency prehospital services, "denounced Diane Lamarre. 
"In the study of budget appropriations, last April, we learn that this Implementation Committee has not met since June 3, 2015. At the same time, the Minister announced a redesign of the service contract in The ambulance sector. What are these decisions based on and these choices? Some aspects, in the light of the Ouellet report, it is clear to us relevant, but the absence of a minister's plan prevents us from understanding his overall vision and some of his decisions, including the withdrawal of the government negotiations with the paramedics. We ask ourselves about the intentions of the minister; He should show transparency and clearly expose his plan, "continued the spokesperson. 
"The paramedics are also perplexed; They do not know where the minister goes away and would like to meet him about it, but their request remained unanswered. Will he agree to meet the paramedics? Will he expose his plan and be transparent? ", Concluded the member.
