Quebec, March 10, 2021 -The Member of Matane-Matapédia, Parliamentary Leader and spokesperson for the Reformation of Democratic Institutions, Pascal Bérubé, is eager to begin the detailed study of Bill 39, Law establishing a new voting system. "If the government does not move immediately, it will be too late for the next general elections," he warned. 
IN SHORT 
The Parti Québécois press the government to call as soon as possible the detailed study of Bill 39, on the reform of the voting mode. The new Quebec political and parliamentary reality makes it necessary to re-believe our mode of Voting. To well be this reform before the next general election was an election promise of the CAQ. 
Like the New Democracy Movement (DND), the Parti Québécois urges the Government of the CAQ to actually launch the reform of the voting system, as it had promised. "We expected enough. The CAQ must honor its commitment and offer Quebeckers a new regional mix of voting, which will better reflect the will of the population. In Parliament, the new multi-party reality requires it, "said the parliamentary leader. 
Pascal Bérubé recalls that it was François Legault himself who had established the roadmap in 2018. "The candidate for the post of prime minister had given his word: elected, he was going to carry out this long-awaited reform. He moves, now; Everyone is ready, "he said. 
Let us remember that recently, the Chief Electoral Officer warned that if we were not going soon, time would fail and reform would not be in effect at the next general election. "Do not act, it is the equivalent to encourage cynicism. François Legault wants to pass for the one who scrolls? I do not believe, "concluded Pascal Bérubé.
