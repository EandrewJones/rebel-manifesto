Quebec - Responding to the Couillard Government's proposal for the Senators' Nomination Process, Stéphane Bergeron, MP for Verchères and Quebec's Word of Party for Quebec-Canada Relations, is sorry to find that the Liberals are still seeking to reform Canadian Senate rather than simply claiming its abolition. 
"Once again, Philippe Couillard misses an opportunity to get to the diapason of Quebeckers and demand the abolition of the Senate. The Liberal Party is struggling to maintain this moribund and undemocratic institution. We pay nearly 100 million per year for this "high room" which is essentially useless. Although the liberal proposal was accepted, the Canadian Prime Minister would still keep the last word about appointments, despite the fact that the Senate should, in theory, fulfill the function of "Chamber of Regions". We are far from a great democratic renewal, "said Stéphane Bergeron. 
Moreover, while the Prime Ministers of Canada and Quebec have fun looking for ways to reform the Senate, several issues remain unndonalized between Quebec and Canada. "Instead of reviving the ball and sketching proposals about the Senate, Philippe Couillard and Justin Trudeau should work towards resolving the important disputes that cost Quebeckers very expensive. The Liberal Party of Quebec could tackle, for example, to the significantly insufficient indexing of health transfers, the unfair ceilings imposed on equalization, or the unfair treatment of Hydro-Québec dividends in the calculation on the part of the Quebec, rather than proposing reforms of naive optimism that does not improve the situation in Quebec, "concluded the member for Verchères.
