Québec-Diane Lamarre, Member of Parliament for Quéillé and spokesman for the health and accessibility of care, denounces the imposition of a third increase in tariffs in three years for insured persons of the public drug plan . 
"While the Prime Minister had committed not to weigh down the tax burden of Quebeckers and to increase any rate beyond inflation, now the RAMQ announces that, from 1 July, the annual premium for Insured will increase from $ 640 to $ 660 a year, an increase of 3.1%. However, during the study of budget appropriations, in April, the documents provided by the Minister of Health reported a forecast of only 0.6% increase in the cost of drugs for the year 2015-2016. Why, therefore, increase so much the contribution of insured? Asked Diane Lamarre. 
"We are talking about a rise in the triple of the inflation rate, which was 1.1% in 2015. We are very far from the promise of Philippe Couillard, and this position is indefensible. How can the Minister of Health justify this umpteenth rise that it refers to patients? , Continued the spokesperson. 
"These are some 3.5 million Quebeckers who will have to absorb this increase, including that of the monthly franchise, which will increase from $ 18 to $ 18.85 a month. Since the arrival of this Liberal government, tariffs have steadily increased; that's enough! "Concluded Diane Lamarre.
