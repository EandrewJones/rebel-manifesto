Montreal- As the flip-flop became a trademark at the CAQ, François Legault made another turnaround yesterday on the issue of municipal employees' pension plans. The Caquist Chief announced to Quebeckers that he rename his platform and that he would not wait for the Love Committee's report before imposing a solution. 
"The lack of rigor that characterizes the CAQ is disturbing. François Legault shows irresponsibility with respect to municipal employee pension plans. He promised to create a committee while there is already one, and there promises us to impose a solution even before hearing the recommendations of this committee! What a lack of respect for representatives of municipalities and employees who were consulted by this committee, not to mention the experts of the Committee, "said Quebec's candidate in the riding of Blainville, Bernard Generous. 
The candidate of the Parti Québécois in the riding of Rousseau, Nicolas Marceau, deplores the dangerous amateurism of François Legault on this file. "François Legault no longer ends up. In its platform, the CAQ offers "an expert committee [which] will also be put in place to propose sustainable solutions to the management of municipal employees' pension plans." However, such a committee has already existed for several months! This committee is chaired by ALBAN D'Amours and is composed of recognized experts. We must believe that François Legault had forgotten the existence of the committee when writing his platform! » 
For the Parti Québécois, there is no question of playing the matamore with the retreats of the workers. "At the Québécois Party, we trust the experts of the Amours Committee and we will inspire ourselves with their recommendations to resolve this problem as soon as possible. We will be responsible and we will act in the interest of Quebeckers, "concluded Nicolas Marceau.
