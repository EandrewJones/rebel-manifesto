François Legault announced this morning that he "entrust the management of the RERs at the Régie des Rentes rather than the banks". At his press, Mr. Legault indicated that this measure will not cost "a penny to government". 
However, during the study of the credits in parliamentary committee on 24 April, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Régie des Antes, Mr. Denys John, indicated, in response to a question from the Parti Québécois, that the establishment would not be done at zero cost but would cost at least $ 25 million: 
Mr. Jean (Denys): I am informed, Mr. Chairman, that the examination, the management assumption of the voluntary retirement savings plan by the Régie des Antes, was done at one time, when There was a question of putting in place this kind of diet there and it is told that the information available to us gives us a cost of implementation of 25 million to adapt the Revenue Québec system to that of the Régie des Antes. This is the information I have. 
These 25 million represent only the costs of setting up the computer system, not to mention the annual recurring costs and the cost of the additional staff that will have to be hired. 
Once again, the CAQ makes an improvised ad, written on the corner of a table. What is amazing is that this information was revealed by the CEO of the Rennies Régie, while the Chatte François Rebello deputy was sitting around the table. Did he forget to communicate this crucial information to his leader? 
A proof of more than François Legault is not ready to govern Quebec in three weeks!
