These will use this budget envelope to maintain and renovate their real estate assets, as well as to replace or enhance their furniture and equipment. 
"Our government wishes to invest in all regions, with the greatest rigor in infrastructure spending. Whether it is major development projects or expenses related to existing assets, our government is committed to improving the quality, accessibility and safety of the care and services offered to the Quebec population, what will contribute the regional envelopes announced today, "said Minister Réjean Hébert. 
"This allowance will allow institutions in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region to realize several projects that will provide a quality service offer to the population. In addition to supporting institutions and professionals in the health and social services network in their mission, these downpayments are a powerful economic leverage, particularly in terms of employment, "said Minister François Gendron. 
This regional envelope stems from total investments of $ 698.2 million across Quebec, which fall within the framework of the Quebec Infrastructure Plan to ensure the sustainability of our infrastructure.
