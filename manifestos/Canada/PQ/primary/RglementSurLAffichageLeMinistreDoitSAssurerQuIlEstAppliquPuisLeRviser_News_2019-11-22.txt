Quebec, on November 22, 2019 - a few days from the deadline given to businesses to comply with the 2016 Display Regulations, the Mapleine Islands and spokesperson for the Quebec Language Party French, Joël Arseneau, press the minister responsible for the French language, Simon Jolin-Barrette, to have it rigorously enforced, before improving him to ensure, finally, a predominant presence of French in the Quebec linguistic landscape. 
IN SHORT 
Let us first remember that in May 2016, the Liberals adopted a new regulation on commercial display; The businesses had more than three years, until next November 24th, to comply with it. "It is, however, to note that this regulation has considerably weakened the presence of French in the Quebec linguistic landscape. It does not impose any predominance; We only speak of a "sufficient presence". This minimum threshold must absolutely be respected, and it is the responsibility of the minister to make sure, "said Joël Arseneau. 
The spokesman is categorical: sanctions must be imposed on businesses fault. "In 2018-2019, the OQLF received more than 2800 complaints, more than half of which were the public display or commercial documentation. The CAQ government has an extraordinary opportunity to prove that its "nationalism" is not one of the facade. The minister must ensure that the OQLF strictly rages against recalcitrant businesses that, in three years, did not think it necessary to adjust, to take action to respect the law, "he added. 
Nevertheless, once the current law is applied, the minister will have to go even further. "Simon Jolin-Barrette is slow to tackle the revision of the rules regarding the display. It must improve them, so that French finds its rights. Because, in Quebec, it is the only official language. If his action plan is vigorous, clear and firm on this point, we may be able to forgive him the time he has put it to present it, "concluded Joël Arseneau.
