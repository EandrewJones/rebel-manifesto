Quebec- At the end of the working session following the hearings of the parliamentary committee on the relevance and impacts of regulating the public selling price of new printed and digital books, the Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, undertakes to propose measures to 12,000 Quebeckers working in this industry within a reasonable time. 
"The situation of independent libraries is worrying and I am very sensitive to it. The Parti Québécois had committed to hold a parliamentary committee on this issue. I am very proud to have respected this commitment inside the first year of our mandate, "said the minister. 
At the end of the Parliamentary Committee, Minister Kotto draws up six main findings: 
"I am pleased to see the work done in recent weeks. This democratic exercise has made it possible to better identify the ins and outs of a regulation of the selling price of new books, while opening more broadly on the habits of reading and consumption of Quebeckers, the creation and the culture. I will bring concrete and viable solutions to maintain a network of independent libraries throughout Quebec and it will not take five years to do it, "concluded Mr. Kotto.
