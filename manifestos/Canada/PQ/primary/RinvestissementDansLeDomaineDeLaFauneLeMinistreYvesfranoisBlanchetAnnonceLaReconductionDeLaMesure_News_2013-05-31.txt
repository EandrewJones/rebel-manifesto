Quebec- The Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Yves-Fran√ßois Blanchet announces the maintenance of reinvestment in the field of wildlife in its current form, for a fifth year in a row. 
"I am pleased to announce the renewal of the reinvestment measure in the wildlife area which, after four years and over $ 15 million invested, has led to more than 450 projects in Quebec," said the Minister . 
Reinvestment in the field of wildlife has become one of the main tools for intervention and partnership for the Wildlife Sector of the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks. Over the years, it has adapted both the needs of wildlife federations than those of the middle organizations. 
In 2009, an increase in fishing, fishing and trapping tariffs, agreed with key wildlife partners, created reinvestment in the wildlife area (RDF). By this budgetary measure, the government invests, every year, about $ 4 million in projects for the development of activities related to exploited wildlife species. Current license selling trends also estimate RDF revenue for 2013-2014. 
"With this sum, the Ministry of Sustainable Development, the Environment, Wildlife and Parks and its wildlife partners will be able to implement even more projects that will help consolidate sustainable wildlife," said the Minister Blanchet.
