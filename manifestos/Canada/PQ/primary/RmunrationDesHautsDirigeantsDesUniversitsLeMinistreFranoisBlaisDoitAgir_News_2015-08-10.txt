Quebec- In response to an article published this morning, regarding the dual remuneration of a Vice-Rector at Laval University, the member for Joliette and the official opposition speech on higher education, Véronique Hivon, Calls on the Minister of Education, Higher Education and Research, François Blais, to act in order to supervise the conditions of remuneration of the senior leaders of Quebec universities. 
"This morning's article confirms the need to act. In the case of submandard conditions of the senior leaders of Laval University, moreover, the impasse has been persuring for more than nine months. Enough is enough. The Minister of Higher Education must quickly introduce a bill to supervise the remuneration and conditions under the term of the senior leaders of Quebec universities, "said Véronique Hivon. 
Remember that the Government of Pauline Marois had tightened the regulations in this matter, ensuring that any changes to the salary or the working conditions of the senior leaders of the universities had to be approved by the Government. 
"We sent a strong signal but, obviously, everyone did not understand it. However, you have to go to the next step. We ask the Minister Blais to introduce a bill on this subject at the beginning of the parliamentary school year, "concluded the member.
