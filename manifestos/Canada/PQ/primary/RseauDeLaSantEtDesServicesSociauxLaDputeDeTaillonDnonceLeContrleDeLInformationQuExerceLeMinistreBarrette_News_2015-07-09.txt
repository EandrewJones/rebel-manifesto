Qu√©bec- The member for Taillon and sentence of the official objection to health and accessibility to care, Diane Lamarre, denounces information control at the Ministry of Health and Social Services (MSSS) since the 'Adoption of bill 10 under gag, last February. 
"We made requests for access to information for details and measuring the extent of compressions of nearly $ 600 million and optimization measures imposed in health and social services in institutions in different regions of the Quebec. We find that old agencies, now called "CISS" and "Ciusss", no longer respond to requests for access to the information themselves. It seems indeed that a directive has been given by the MSSS which requires institutions to redirect the requests. This is a good example of all the centralization of the powers and the control of the information we have denounced throughout the study of Bill 10. It is deplorable! Diane Lamarre said. 
Section 48 of the Access to Information Act invoked not to respond to claims suggests that institutions do not have the competence to do so, while it is the opposite. 
"Never in the past This article has been invoked not to respond to requests with respect to budgets and institutional optimization measures. Why muzzle institutions? Previously, it is still agencies and institutions themselves who responded to requests for access to information. Why does this decline in terms of transparency and, above all, in terms of the autonomy of institutions? , "Said the spokesperson. 
"It's unacceptable that the MSSS exercises such information control. The Minister praises his reform, but prohibits new institutions to transmit the information they hold. When we are proud of the results, we should have nothing to hide anything. The minister must now end these obscure practices that deprive institutions of their autonomy and, above all, who deprive citizens of access to the information they are entitled, "concluded Diane Lamarre.
