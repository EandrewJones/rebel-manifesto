Quebec, on September 16, 2016 -The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesman of the Parti Party in terms of education, research and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, regrets that the government took two and a half years before Give priority to the educational success of all students, after having made significant cuts in the education network. 
"After three minister changes, after two and a half years to virevolt, to cut draconally into student services, the government finally responds to our requests and announces that he now wants to focus on student success," declared Alexandre Cloutier. 
Remember that the Parti Québécois government announced in 2013 the development of a policy on school perseverance and another on adult education and continuing education. "Three years later, the liberal heritage in education is a disaster. It boils down to an attempt at structural brewing, cups in the network that have greatly affected direct services to students, and two cooked failures, the attempt of the Liberals to reform school governance and to concentrate the power in The hands of the minister, "added the member for Lac Saint John. 
Major reinvestment 
"It will take that the minister's shades and the Prime Minister and the counseling days are accompanied by a major reinvestment in education, otherwise the announcement of this morning will have been a wishful wish. Because we realize, when we analyze the figures of the last update of the Ministry of Finance, that in the first quarter of 2016, the government has spent $ 10 million less to education than the same period last year. We want to leave the chance at the runner but since the last minister, Sébastien Proulx, the figures of the Ministry of Finance show that no reinvestment is made. However, consultation days will not be enough to guarantee the success of our students. The government must stop playing with the numbers and make sure, rather, that the sums are at the rendezvous, "concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
