Montréal - The Parti Québécois launches its second web advertisement and invites voters to make the choice to enrich themselves by supporting the Parti Québécois program, especially for a responsible development of our natural wealth. 
The Plan of the Parti Québécois rests on six axes: 
Thus, a Quebec party government will increase royalties on natural resources by setting a minimal fee based on gross income just as it is done in many countries. We will also establish a tax on the surplus profits of the mining companies to ensure a more equitable sharing of our collective wealth. 
A Quebec party government intends to ensure that the state takes part in the ownership of certain strategic projects and also intends to ensure maximum transformation of our resources in Quebec. 
"Quebec is full of outstanding natural riches. To obtain the best spin-offs and enrich Quebeckers, we must refuse to be dispossessed from our natural resources and quickly resume control. This is the majority that must take advantage of it, not a minority. It must be done in respect of the environment and communities. It is possible and this is the plan of the Parti Québécois, "said Quebec's leader, Pauline Marois.
