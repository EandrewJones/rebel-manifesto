Montreal- The leader of the Partician, Pauline Marois, is committed to setting up a tax credit to encourage the practice of sports activities among young people. "A real public health policy must contain prevention measures, and the practice of physical activity clearly contributes to having better health. To encourage young people to play sports, a Quebec party government will give parents' means to put their children with sports activities in an association, a federation or a club, "she explained. 
The Parti Québécois is committed to providing a refundable tax credit by $ 500 per child aged 5 to 16, for any registration for sports activities for families with less than $ 130,000. This measure will affect just over 300,000 young people. It will cost $ 25 million that will be drawn from the specific tax on tobacco products. 
We will also put in place a program to increase sports activities in public schools. 
"According to statistics, one in three families can not afford his children to sports activities. Yet a young person who practices a sport he loves is more likely to maintain healthy lifestyle habits. The more youth will be active and fit, the more they will have a good quality of life and good health. In addition, this inexpensive action will allow in a few years to make substantial savings in the health sector. ", Concluded Pauline Marois.
