Montreal - The Leader of the Partician, Pauline Marois, is committed to better supervising temporary investment agencies that offer staff services in all areas of employment. "This is an industry that is booming in Quebec. People who are employed by these agencies are often vulnerable and know the laws and regulations that supervise work in Quebec. Some agency practices are sometimes doubtful. It is more than time to manage them adequately, "said Pauline Marois. 
A government government will adopt a law that will introduce three specific measures to frame the practices of these investment agencies. First, obtaining an operational permit will be made mandatory, an employment information information form will also be mandatory and ultimately, a principle of co-responsibility between agencies and client companies will be established. 
The situation of workers of investment agencies is special. On the one hand, there is the agency hiring staff and payroll. On the other hand, there is the agency's customer who oversees the worker and directs it on a daily basis. The hired person is paid by the agency, but she works for her client. Being stuck between two companies places the agency employee in a difficult situation in relation to labor rights. In theory, the same rights should apply, but in practice the application of these rights is often more difficult. 
"We want to better supervise the practices of these agencies to protect the rights of workers. Some do not know their schedule or salary or even the name of the company that hires them. These practices must stop. The worker is often the big loser in the relationship between the agency and the employer. It is noted that the employer tends to disappower against this employee, treated as if he was second-class. We will go to workers their right place. We have a moral duty to make sure they are treated with dignity and respect, "concluded Pauline Marois.
