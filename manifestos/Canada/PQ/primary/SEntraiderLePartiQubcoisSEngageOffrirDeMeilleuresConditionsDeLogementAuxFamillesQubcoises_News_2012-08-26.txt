Montreal- The Leader of the Party Party, Pauline Marois, is committed to investing $ 35 million per five years in the AccessLogis Québec program to provide better housing conditions for Quebec families. The budget of this program will be increased to nearly $ 210 million a year. "We will put in place a real multi-year plan to achieve new community housing units. We are committed to building 15,000 more accommodation, 3000 per year over five years to house families as well as vulnerable and traveling people. These units will have to comply with ambitious energy standards, "said Pauline Marois, making public the commitments of the Parti Québécois in social housing. 
Many cities are struggling with a serious shortage of private rental housing. In some of them, the vacancy rate is of particular concern and many Quebeckers have trouble staying. Thus, in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, this rate is 0.1% to Amos, 0.3% in Rouyn-Noranda and 0.2% in Val d'Or. On the North Shore, there is a rate of 0.3% to seven-islands and 2% at Baie-Comeau. The vacancy rate is also low to Gaspé (1.7%), in Quebec City (0.7%) or Saguenay (0.7%). The equilibrium threshold is 3% fixed. 
"With such vacancy rates, we see that it is necessary to act to help many households to stay. While the Caquists do not offer absolutely nothing about it, the Liberals have left the situation to worsen. The Québécois party has decided to act and we will invest $ 25 million, or 5 million per year over five years, for the construction of additional affordable housing by boring the affordable housing program Québec - private component, "added Pauline Marois. 
"In total, it's $ 200 million over five years that we will invest in community and affordable housing," added Pauline Marois. A Partician government will act to help the poor and vulnerable and traveling people. It is by helping each other we are stronger. It is the choice that a government of the Parti Québécois offers Quebeckers, "concluded Pauline Marois.
