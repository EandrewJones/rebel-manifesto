The Pocatière - the leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, is committed to supporting the agricultural environment by investing more in the succession. "I'm making a commitment to enhance agricultural succession programs. The Québécois party will invest $ 20 million more per year to give our young farmers to thumb up so that they can prosper in this vital sector for our economy and for Quebec, "said Pauline Marois. 
"After a long career, many farmers want to leave their land to their children. This is unfortunately not possible for all. Some 800 farms sold each year in Quebec, 10 to 12% are found in the hands of a new owner who has no relationship. We will help young producers take over. Farm Financial will have the mandate to develop new solutions to support agricultural succession, "she explained. 
This measure to support agricultural succession adds to those already announced by Pauline Marois to promote the development of Quebec agriculture. 
"Our farmers and their products are an incredible source of pride for Quebeckers. Food sovereignty policy is a key element of our agricultural policy. The objective is to increase from 33% to 50% the proportion of Quebec foods consumed in Quebec. Thanks to a fund dedicated to innovation, the transformation and distribution of Quebec products and through increased support to Québec's controlled appellations, it will be possible to better support the agricultural environment. Developing our agriculture, enhance this neuralgic sector and encourage succession, this is what the Parti Québécois intends to do on September 5th if it is brought to power, "concluded Pauline Marois.
