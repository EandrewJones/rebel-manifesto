Quebec- The Minister of Labor, Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Ms. Agn√®s Maltais announces the appointment of Mr. Julien Perron as a conciliator in the negotiations between the corporation of dealerships. Automobiles Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean-Chibougamau and the Democratic Syndicate of Garage Employees Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (CSD). 
"I think the time has come, after eleven months of conflict, to bring about a rapprochement between the parties. In a region such as Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, a conflict that affects hundreds of workers and who paralyzes a whole commercial sector is not without consequence. I ask the employers and the union members to seize the perch that is tense and resume the negotiations in the presence of the conciliator, "said the Minister of Labor. 
Since the beginning of the conflict, last March, the Ministry of Labor has contacted the parties to offer them to resort to conciliation, but no request has been addressed to it. The intervention of the Minister derives from the powers conferred on him by Article 55 DuCode du Labor: "At any phase of the negotiations, the Minister may, ex officio, designate a conciliator; He must then inform the parts of this appointment ". 
Remember that the conflict affects 27 car dealers in the region. The collective agreements of some 430 employees have been exposed since 18 February 2013. In most cases, union members have been in lockout since March 5th. 
"The conciliator is ready to get to work. I invite union and employers' representatives to collaborate with him and negotiate in good faith to find a compromise. Only the negotiation can make it possible to untie the impasse and only the parties have the key to the solution, "concluded Minister Maltese.
