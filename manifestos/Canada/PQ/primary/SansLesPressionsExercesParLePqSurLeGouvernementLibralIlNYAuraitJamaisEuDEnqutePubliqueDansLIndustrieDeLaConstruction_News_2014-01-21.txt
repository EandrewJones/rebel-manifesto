Québec- The Parti Québécois posed many gestures for all light to be made on the allegations of corruption and collusion in the construction industry and to restore integrity in the process of granting public contracts. The PQ defended this principle before, during and after the elections. 
In the opposition, despite the stubborn refusal of the Liberal government to create a commission of inquiry, the Parti Québécois has never dropped. We heated the Liberal government day after day for two years by placing hundreds of questions, by offering a dozen motions, depositing petitions, mobilizing the population and multiplying public interventions.Dè October 2009, the Prime Minister, Then speaker of the opposition, reiterated the need to hold a commission of inquiry with a broad mandate. 
"If pressure had been exercised on the PQ to prevent us from demanding a construction commission on construction, they would have hit a wall. An integrity wall, "said the leader of the government and hon. Member for Chicoutimi, Mr. Stéphane Bédard. 
To the government, the PQ continued its struggle for corruption, particularly with the mandate of the commission of inquiry, enassigning the financing of political parties and adopting the most binding laws on ethics. 
"It's certainly not a coincidence that Quebec has adopted the most stringent measures in combating collusion and corruption. Without the constant pressures of the PQ on the Liberal government, there would never have an investigation. Once in power, we did the housework. We ask the necessary gestures to bring the public confidence to its institutions. Our will is unshakable, "concluded Stéphane Bédard.
