In Chauveau, a journalist and ex-municipal councilor presents himself for the Parti Québécois: Sebastien Couture. He is from Tewksbury and has always lived in Chauveau. 
He was elected for the first time at 27 years as a municipal councilor. He became involved in the Youth Commission of the Jacques-Cartier and the Youth Forum of the Capitale-Nationale. As many have affirmed in recent weeks, Sébastien is the candidate who best knows Chauveau's files. Here, the Jonathan Trudeau analyst, in Choi Radio X: http: //go.pq.org/ddt 
He said: 
".... I would like to not notice the good performance that the Québécois candidate does in Chauveau. Sebastien Couture ... At the level of deep knowledge of the files, sincerely it is he who master the best the files ... We see that he really has a profound knowledge of the files of the profile of his county .... " 
And also, Gérard Deltell, always on the waves of Choi: 
"Sebastien sewing is a good application. This guy, he is young and dynamic, he is involved in the county, he was a municipal councilor ... ". 
You can see by listening to the debate on the wave of Radio-Canada: http: //go.pq.org/dds 
Among the many files that challenge Sébastien, mention that of the environment and the protection of water. Lake Saint-Charles represents 53% of the consumption of drinking water in Quebec City. This is an important issue for the population. 
Two articles talk about it: http: //go.pq.org/drethttp: //go.pq.org/ddq 
The CAQ has not been able to keep an excellent deputy, Gérard Deltell. Why vote CAQ? The population has the best choice: the PQ, the best candidates, the best team to defend the interests of the people of Chauveau and Jean-Talon.
