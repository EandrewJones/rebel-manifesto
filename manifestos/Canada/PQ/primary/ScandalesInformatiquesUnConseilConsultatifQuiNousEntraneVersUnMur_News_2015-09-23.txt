Qu√©bec- The member for Sanguinet and spokesman for the Treasury Board for the Treasury Board and In Pension, Economics, Exports and Information Resources, Alain Therrien, notes that the Quebec Advisory Council for Technologies. The information, set up by the Treasury Board Secretariat, lost a large part of its legitimacy with the withdrawal of the professional association of free software companies (APELL). 
"The APELL considers that the government does not take the right path to resolve computer scandals. Full of large private firms that already control the sector, the conclusions of the Council will certainly go in the direction of their interests, "denounced the member for Sanguinet. 
Indeed, the Apell tells us that the solutions proposed by the Council will promote the big players, will weaken the competition and, above all, will not help the Quebec SMEs of the field of IT that need a door of entry to grow. "There is a repetition of what happened in 2004, when the Government of Jean Charest had also brought together engineering firms and the Ministry of Transport in a consultation committee. Shortly afterwards, we could see what this strategy had given in terms of collusion, corruption and cost overruns. Are we witnessing the same thing to the Treasury Board? Some indices suggest that yes, "said the member for Sanguinet. 
"The Liberals and the President of the Treasury Board, Martin Coiteous, have a bias for big computer and private firms: six of the ten computer firms that receive the most contracts every year are based with the minister to find solutions. cost overruns. It's like we asked the wolf how to make the henhouse be better kept! The coiteful minister must listen to what groups like the Apell have to propose, "concluded Alain Therrien.
