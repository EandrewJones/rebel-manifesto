Quebec- The Minister of Public Safety, Stéphane Bergeron, is pleased to announce that the MRC of Haute-Yamaska has obtained its conformity certificate for its fire safety scheme. The Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport and Minister responsible for the Montérégie Region, Mrs Marie Malavoy, welcomed this announcement. 
This certificate is accompanied by a $ 20,000 grant paid to the MRC in accordance with the MRC Financial Assistance Program and other regional authorities for the establishment and implementation of risk coverage schemes. 
"I am pleased to announce that the MRC de la Haute-Yamaska has successfully completed the development of its fire safety risk cover scheme. This important regional planning exercise will enable the MRC to increase the effectiveness of fire safety services on its territory and, by the same fact, to significantly reduce fire losses, "said Minister Bergeron . 
Risk coverage schemes are aimed at increasing the knowledge of fire risks present in a territory. Thus, they not only improve services to citizens while optimizing resources, but also to provide more efficient coverage of territories in the event of fire and facilitate the work of community stakeholders. It is therefore a must-see action for the 103 regional authorities and for the municipalities of Quebec. 
For his part, the minister wanted to emphasize the work of the MRC. "I am proud of the work done by the MRC of Haute-Yamaska, since the fire safety hedge scheme will allow him to offer more effective protection to his citizens," Ms. Malavoy said. 
The development of risk coverage schemes is the most important step in setting up the new conditions that should improve Quebec's balance sheet in terms of human losses due to fire.
