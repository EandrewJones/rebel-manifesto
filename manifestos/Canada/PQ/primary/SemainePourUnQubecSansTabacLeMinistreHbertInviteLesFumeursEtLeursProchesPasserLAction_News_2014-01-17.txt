Québec- "The prevention and adoption of sound lifestyle habits is a growing concern, both for our health network, but also for all Quebeckers and Quebeckers. Smoking abandonment is a very symbolic gesture in this chapter. As the Quebec week begins for Quebec without smoking, I encourage smokers to take action and crush once and all. This is what the Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Elders, Dr. Réjean Hébert, on the eve of Laseine for a Quebec without tobacco, which takes place this year from 19 to 25 January. 
Tobacco is 28 victims per day in Quebec. He is responsible for the death of no less than 10,400 Quebeckers each year, thus constituting the most important cause of avoidable deaths. Smokers who want to stop smoking can count on various smoking assistance services offered free of charge, including smoking abandonment centers from all regions of Quebec. 
"Those who choose to stop smoking opt for a better quality of life and for better health. Indeed, to stop smoking, it is prolonging its life expectancy of nearly 10 years. We can all contribute to lowering the smoking rate in Quebec, including encouraging smokers around our entourage to take action. This is a way of participating in the well-being of our society - including our youth - and gradually develop a smoke-free Quebec, "said Minister Hébert. 
Remember that the Ministry of Health and Social Services leads many actions to encourage a profound change in smoking social standards, actions primarily supporting the Québec tobacco and Québec Smoking Act. . Efforts are thus deployed for prevention, particularly with young people, as well as for protection against exposure to second-hand smoke.
