Montreal- The Minister of Immigration and Cultural Communities and Minister responsible for the Charter of the French Language, Ms. Diane de Courcy, today proceeded to the launch of the Quebec week of intercultural encounters animated by Mr. Eric Meboua . The Zuruba Afro-Brazilian percussions set and the Nyata Nyata dance company in Zab Maboungou also offered a service during the event. The week takes place this year from September 30th to October 6th on the theme rub shoulders, to know each other, gather. "This theme reflects what is constantly and frequent in our neighborhoods, our schools, our workplaces, our parks, at the grocery store and elsewhere. The proximity promotes the knowledge of the other. These are the beginnings that allow Quebeckers from all walks of life to unite in a world that promotes sharing and exchange, "said the minister. 
Organized by the Ministry of Immigration and Cultural Communities since 2003, the Quebec week of intercultural encounters aims to emphasize the contribution of ethnocultural diversity to the social, economic and cultural development of Quebec, promote intercultural dialogue and reconciliation and bring down prejudices and discrimination so that every Quebecker and every Quebecker fully participates in the development of our society. 
Several Quebec institutions celebrate each year this week by organizing, in particular, open days, exhibitions, artistic events and community dinners. "It's a great opportunity to emphasize the contribution of diversity and rub shoulders, to know oneself and gather," the minister concluded.
