Sherbrooke- What I wanted do not reflect my thoughts on the subject. Pauline Marois is an exceptional woman, who is the most competent to be premier of Quebec. And it has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that it is a woman. This question is settled for a beautiful Lucette. Quebeckers are made elsewhere. They judge people according to what they have in the belly and their skills. This is why I am convinced that Ms. Marois will succeed in carrying the Quebecois party on September 4th. I would not have worn candidate in his team if I was not convinced.
