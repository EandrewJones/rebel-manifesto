Quebec- The member of Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson in terms of primary and secondary education and school perseverance, Nicole Léger, notes once again that the wild party cuts directly affect the services to parents and young people. 
"Not only has the government decreed a rise in child care rates in schools from $ 7.30 to $ 8, but has also decided to reduce its subsidies from 9% to 43%, depending on the number of young people attending the Guard Service. What it means is that parents will pay more to have even fewer services, "denounced light Nicole. 
"This time, the government can not attempt to blame schools; This is a decision of the Minister of Education, François Blais, that he has taken by personally approving new budget rules, "said Madame Léger. 
The speech of the Liberals is not credible 
"For more than a year, the government has repeated ad Naifeam that education cuts do not affect student services. But we have known for a long time that all this was only powder in the eyes. The Liberal government must stop looking for emissar goals, "the spokesman concluded.
