At the request of the Parti Québécois, the Planning Commission met on Monday to find solutions to the difficulties of access to local financial services in the region. Sylvain Gaudreault, whip of the official opposition and spokesperson for the development of regions and decentralization, has presented concrete ideas going in this direction. 
IN SHORT 
In parliamentary committee, discussions with financial institutions and municipalities have made it possible to advance in searching for solutions. "It is essential that one and the others put some of their infrastructures in common to reduce costs, which will provide local financial services," says Sylvain Gaudreault. 
According to the spokesman, the federal government must guide Canada Post to discuss with financial institutions and municipalities to put its resources for the regions. "Post offices are present throughout the territory, they can be used to improve the services offered in the region," he advanced. Quebec's questions have shown that post offices can be part of the solution. 
On the other hand, currently the financial services in the region are mainly based on a single financial institution: Desjardins. "Banks should also do their part," added Sylvain Gaudreault. Access to a real high-speed Internet service, no matter where we are in Quebec, would also help improve the situation. "On that, I do not have congratulations to the Liberal government; He has been dragging his feet for too long, "he lamented. 
The member is satisfied with the holding of this parliamentary committee, the result of the Leadership of the Parti Québécois. "My riding is located in the region; Access to services is an issue that interposes me directly. I am pleased that we could discuss it at the National Assembly. To the Parti Québécois, we are in "Solutions" mode; The CAQ and the Liberal Party, they had nothing to suggest, "he concluded.
