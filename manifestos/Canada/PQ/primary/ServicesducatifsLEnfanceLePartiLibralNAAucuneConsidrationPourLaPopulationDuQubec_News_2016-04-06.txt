Québec- Following a working session of the Citizen Relations Committee, the member for Labelle and spokesman for the Parti Québécois family, Sylvain Pagé, denounces the total lack of consideration for the population of deputies Liberals, who refused to take note of the historical petition of 250,000 signatories demonstrating the importance of educational services to childhood, filed by the Quebec Association of Early Childhood Centers. 
"The arguments put forward by the members of the Liberal Party to explain their decision had no sense and were purely dogmatic. More than 250,000 people have signed this petition, it's not nothing! A petition is an important democratic tool that we have given ourselves to allow the people to be heard. The Liberal government can not simply reject it from the reverse of the hand; If he respects the citizens, he has the duty to take himself into account, "said the member for Labelle. 
"Our child care network is a pride for Quebec; Many countries of the world send it to us. However, the ideological choice of government touches hard the quality of services offered to our children. Worse, the Liberal refusal to look into the future of early childhood centers is more evidence that they govern without listening to the population, they have no respect for its claims. In short, having no consideration for the 250,000 petitioners, the Liberal members reaffirmed that they ignore citizen democracy, that they do not believe in the public network and that they will not do anything to protect it, " concluded Sylvain Pagé.
