Quebec, on May 4, 2017- The Quebec Party spokesman, Véronique Hivon, explains himself the enthusiasm afficked by the Quebec Minister of Justice, Stéphanie Valley, last Friday, at the exit of the Federal-Provincial-Territorial Conference of Justice Ministers. Ottawa has decided that our justice system should be content with 4 nominations at the Superior Court of Quebec, while a unanimous motion of the National Assembly asked to fill a minimum of 14 positions. 
In short, the Quebec party estimates that the 4 nominations at the Superior Court are insufficient to meet the urgent needs of the justice system. Only one of the appointed persons has criminal and criminal experience; It is very little to solve the crisis of unreasonable deadlines.- The enthusiasm of Minister Valley at last Friday meeting with its counterparts in Canada was not justified, considering the lack of results obtained today. ** 
"We are learning today that the federal government has appointed only 4 judges to the Superior Court of Quebec. Now, not only do these 4 nominations do not even fill the 6 vacancies - and that is not to mention that Québec calls for the creation of 8 additional posts - but, in addition, only one of the names has experience in law. criminal. In short, the needs remain screaming in criminal and criminal matters. This decision, added to the inaction of the government, maintains the judicial system of Quebec in a state of crisis. It should be remembered that the admission of Minister Valley, 95% of the cases before the Montreal District Superior Court are the subject of a request for the procedures, "says the member. 
"We are far from the account; 10 positions of judge remain to fill in the Superior Court. Minister Valley, who had last Friday's enthusiasm, obviously failed to convince his federal counterpart. How does she explain this failure today? Requested Véronique Hivon.
