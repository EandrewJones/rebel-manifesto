Quebec- The member for Berthier and spokesman for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, denounced, during an interpellation to the National Assembly, the inconsistency of Minister Pierre Paradis, who should Invest in agriculture instead of cutting budgets and ignore succession applications. 
"Minister Paradis constantly repeats that the agri-food sector has a larger economic impact for Quebec than aeronautics. Why, then, has the government invested $ 1.3 billion in a bad deal with Bombardier, while cut $ 151 million in the operating budgets of the Farm Financial? "Asked André Villeneuve. 
"The minister tells us about the future, but he is not listening to the succession. He instructed someone else to report, while successful youth have already made concrete proposals. Why does not he listen to them? ", Continued the member for Berthier. 
André Villeneuve also pointed out that Minister Paradis put an end to the policy of food sovereignty, pushing the audacity until the department's website withdrawn, which is unusual for government policy. "The predecessor of the Minister, François Gendron, had made the policy of food sovereignty, which was welcomed by all the actors of the sector. Pierre Paradis, he chose to remove any reference to this policy, in order to camouflage his own inaction. Farmers are not fooled; They understand that the Liberal Party is curbing the momentum of the agri-food sector, "he concluded.
