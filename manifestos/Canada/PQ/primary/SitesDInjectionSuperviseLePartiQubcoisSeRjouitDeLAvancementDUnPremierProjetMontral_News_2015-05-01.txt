Quebec- The member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, protection of youth, home care and prevention, Jean-François Lisée, and the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Carole Poirier, rejoice in the announcement that a first Montreal project of supervised injection site is authorized; They ask the Liberal government to commit to unlock the amounts necessary for the realization of the project. 
"Not only supervised injection sites encourage safe practices for drug users, which are more at risk for infections or overdose, but, in addition, they reduce the number of syringes left in public places and contribute to Decrease the sharing of syringes. It is a project that will certainly have positive impacts on the public health, and which will help us better fight homelessness. Nevertheless, we hope that this time, the Minister Delegate to Rehabilitation will more actively defend Quebec priorities, and more particularly this project, to the federal government, "said Jean-François Lisée. 
"Very awaited in Montreal, this announcement, however, occurs in the full period of austerity; We hope that the Liberal government will involve the investments required for supervised injection sites to be born. This is a carrier project, a real bridge between prevention and reintegration, but that will require more than a paper support, "says Carole Poirier. 
The hon. Member has also stressed all the work done for many years by the fields in the field so that this project materializes, in particular that of the public health department of Montreal, teams working in the network of Health, and Cactus Montreal, street spectrum, dopamine and anonymous. "Without the commitment and collaboration of these and other actors in the health of health, community and the municipal level, this project could not be achieved," she concluded.
