Quebec, November 30, 2017- The Leader of the Official Opposition, Jean-François Lisée, the Spokesperson for Immigration and Cultural Communities, Carole Poirier, and the Quebec-Canada relations spokesperson, Nicolas Marceau, sent a letter today to the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, as well as to the Federal Minister of Immigration, Ahmed D. Hussen, so that they act to prevent the young Leyon Pavithra Lawrence And his family are deported to Sri Lanka this Sunday. 
IN SHORT 
"The case of Leony Pavithra Lawrence touched Quebeckers and Quebeckers. She and her family represent a model, a success in terms of integration with Quebec society. Deportation is scheduled for this Sunday; Justin Trudeau's government must act now, it has the means! Because breaking the expectations and dreams of a young woman as promising, who nourishes such beautiful ambitions, it would be an aberration, "said Jean-François Lisée. 
"Leony Pavithra Lawrence would be deported, even if it has been accepted at CEGEP, and has received a Certificate of Acceptance from Quebec and a federal government study. While everything was about believing that she would be able to stay in Quebec and start her college course in January. The decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada is at least difficult to understand; Ottawa must repair this error, "said Carole Poirier. 
"We are asking the federal government to grant temporary residence permits to all family members for humanitarian grounds. The death threats of which they were victims at Sri Lanka show that their safety is not assured. It should be noted that this opinion is also that of Amnesty International, which requires a grace period to make all the light on this situation, "concluded Nicolas Marceau.
