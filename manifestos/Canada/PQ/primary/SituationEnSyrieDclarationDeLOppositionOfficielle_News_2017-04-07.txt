Québec- The Leader of the Official Opposition, Jean-François Lisée, as well as the spokesman for the Quebecois on international relations, Stéphane Bergeron, made the following statement regarding the current situation in Syria. 
"For several years, we have deplored and condemn the barbarism of the Syrian regime. The use of chemical weapons, which is more against civilians, is one of the worst war crimes that can be committed. Quebec must support any attempt to resolve the Syrian conflict, and it necessarily involves concerted action by the international community and the United Nations. 
We support the annihilation initiatives of Daesh and the departure of Bashar Al-Assad. This odious regime must imperatively be stopped so that the Syrian people can finally aspire to better days. In closing, we obviously have a thought for all the victims of the conflict, as well as for Quebecers and Quebeckers with family or relatives in Syria. »
