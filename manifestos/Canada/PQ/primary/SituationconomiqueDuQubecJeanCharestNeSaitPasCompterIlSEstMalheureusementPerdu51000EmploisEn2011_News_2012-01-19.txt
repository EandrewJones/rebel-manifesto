Quebec- The member for Rousseau and the official opposition spokeswoman in the field of finance and economic development, Nicolas Marceau, reproach the Prime Minister of Quebec, Jean Charest, to mislead the population in the economic situation of Quebec . 
"The reality is implacable: from January 1st to December 31, 2011, it has unfortunately lost 51,000 jobs in Quebec. These are the figures of the Quebec Institute of Statistics. To say that he has created 38,500 jobs in Quebec, as Jean Charest did today, it is deceiving the population, "denounced Nicolas Marceau. 
Quebec is the only province where employment declined in 2011. In addition, in its latest budget, the Minister of Finance, Raymond Bachand, planned to create 55,400 jobs in 2011. "Minister Bachand is therefore deficit of 106,400 jobs on its forecasts. To hear Jean Charest say today that he has no reason to believe that Quebec will have an economic performance below average in 2012 is absolutely laughed: all the economists in Quebec, including the Ministry of Finance, say exactly the opposite ! , Continued the spokesman. 
The member for Rousseau believes that if the Liberal government is in jovialism, Quebec goes directly into a wall. "Last September, we said that the Liberal government had burned all its cartridges to stimulate Quebec's economy, by overfeating the construction community with public investment. The net result is that Quebec's debt climbed at a record level where Jean Charest can, without the shadow of a doubt, bring the title of Mr. Debt, "he added. 
"By announcing today the creation of three committees, Jean Charest again has again confirmed, after his finance minister. Unfortunately, it is not by multiplying the creation of committees and wanting to take Quebeckers for suitcases to relaunch Quebec's economy, "concluded the member.
