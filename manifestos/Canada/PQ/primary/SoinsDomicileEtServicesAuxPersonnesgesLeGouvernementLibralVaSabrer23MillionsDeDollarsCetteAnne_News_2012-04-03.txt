Québec- The Parti Québécois revealed today in the National Assembly a secret of the last budget presented by Raymond Bachand concerning the care of the elderly. 
In its budget, the Liberal government undertook to spend $ 200 million for its investment plan for the elderly for financial year 2012-2013 (page E111). However, for the same plan, in the last budget presented a few weeks ago, the government announced that it devotes $ 177 million (page 9). Net result: $ 23 million less for seniors. 
"The Liberal government can publish beautiful fascicles and mirror mirrogenous amounts, net income is that investments promised to treat our elderly people are not at the rendezvous. There is therefore nothing surprising that the Protector of the Citizen comes to the same conclusion as we; Our elders are neglected by the current government, "said official opposition and hon. Member for Charlevoix, Pauline Marois. 
"The Charest government has promoted us for months a plan of action to better support our elders and their families, but already, it still seems like a wish. By reading the small print of budget documents, there are unfortunately bad news for our elders, "continued the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesman for seniors, Carole Poirier. 
The Québécois party estimates that Quebec is an important turn to help our elders and their families. "It's certainly not by offering 25 cents a day to the caregivers, as does the Charest government, which we will make this important turn so necessary," concluded Carole Poirier.
