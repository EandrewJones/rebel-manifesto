"Given the improvisation of the Minister of Health - who disrupts our health system without prior consultation - and his intransigence, we meet today to launch a message: his approach is not the good and the" wall " to wall ", it does not work. A solution as simplistic as Bill 20 will not solve a problem as complex as the lack of accessibility to our public health system.

Together, today and tomorrow, they will discuss access to care and offer carrier solutions for the future of our public health network. I thank them once again for their daily commitment and their willingness to ensure that our health system is accessible to all, at the right time, and, above all, proportionally effective at the substantial sums devoted to it, "concluded the member. taillon.
