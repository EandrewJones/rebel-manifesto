Quebec- The member for Berthier and spokesman for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, finds that after two and a half years in office, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and the Food, Pierre Paradis, has still not developed an agri-food strategy, made necessary because of the abolition, by the Liberals, of the policy of food sovereignty. 
"By arriving in 2014, the first thing Pierre Paradis made is to put the ax in the policy of food sovereignty, which had received praise from the whole agri-food environment. Two and a half years later, the minister has no strategy, no concrete plan to revive the sector. After thirty months, all that the Liberal government has to offer is a consultation. Where was the minister, all this time? He had more than two years to consult. What farmers and processors require, it is an agri-food strategy that will allow them to realize their full potential. By only launching a preliminary approach to a possible vertex, Minister Pierre Paradis Rate lamentably the target, "said André Villeneuve. 
Nearly a year ago, a coalition of agribusiness actors, conducted by the Union of Agricultural Farmers and the Quebec Food Transformation Council, demanded a strategy. "The needs of the agri-food sector are known. Producers and processors are well aware of consumer demands, and Minister Paradis dare to tell them that they are not listening. Does he know that all stakeholders agree that he himself has serious shortcomings on this plan? It's been two and a half years since he is in his office cutting in the budgets without talking to anyone and, suddenly, he decides that they are farmers and processors who do not consult consumers. The minister should come out of his office and go to one of the multiple dynamic companies working in the sector; Thus, he will be able to understand, or even see, how they constantly consult consumers and learn about their needs, "concluded André Villeneuve.
