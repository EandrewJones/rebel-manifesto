We have just completed intense work. I would like to sincerely thank all those who took part in this dialogue. 
Over the past 36 hours, we have been able to establish many consensus on structuring measures that will allow us to commit ourselves to a knowledge society. 
It is working around the stakes that unite us that we can move forward. At the end of these frank discussions, we can conclude that from now on, the universities will be properly funded, that there will be a more efficient and transparent university accountability, that tuition fees will be predictable than the debt Student will be limited and that accessibility to higher education will be ensured. 
We can now hope that we will live no divisions like those we lived last year. 
We are now continuing our work to another step. In order to ensure the continuity of the efforts that have been made for several weeks, the Government opens five work sites who have as objectives to define the principles of a framework law of the universities, to develop a proposal for a structure and mandate From the National Council of Universities, to optimize the offer of collegiate training in Quebec, to review the policy of financing universities and, finally, to improve financial assistance for studies with student associations. 
We have challenges to take up. Quebec can - and must - join the top of the country's leading peluton in education. The continuation of the excellence, creativity and fulfillment of our young people will come to the center of our priorities. 
Because, you know, nothing can stop a people who speaks, who tighten the elbows and starts. Let's work together to deploy a Quebec from Knowledge for All. This is the challenge we all invited from now.
