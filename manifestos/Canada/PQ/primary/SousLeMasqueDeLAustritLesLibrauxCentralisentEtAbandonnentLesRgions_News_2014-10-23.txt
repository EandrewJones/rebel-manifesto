Quebec, on October 23, 2014 -The MP for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, and the member for Gaspé and Spokesperson for the Development of Regions, Gaétan Lelièvre, denounce the will of the Liberal government to centralize further Decisions, which reduces the tools and resources available for the regions of Quebec. 
"Under the mask of austerity, the Liberal Party, with the support of the CAQ, made a deliberate choice to tackle the means given to the regions to occupy their territory, to assume their economic development and create jobs. There is a centralization exercise around ministries in Quebec City, as if the Liberals knew better than people in the field how to serve their fellow citizens, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
The bad liberal decisions reduce the proximity of services: 
The member for Gaspé emphasizes the essential contribution of CLDs to the economy of the regions. "The CLDs are places of consultation and action that arouse maximum local development and the care of communities in the face of their future. They often prove to be the only professional and financial resources available to local and regional leaders in their hard fight for the dynamic occupation of their territory. If the CLDs are removed, several regions of Quebec are likely to lose their unique and essential tool for consultation and development, "concluded Gaétan Lelièvre.
