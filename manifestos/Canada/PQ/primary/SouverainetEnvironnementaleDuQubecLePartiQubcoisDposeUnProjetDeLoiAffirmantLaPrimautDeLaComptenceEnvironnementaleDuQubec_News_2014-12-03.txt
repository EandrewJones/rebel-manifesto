Quebec- The member for Jonquière and the official opposition spokesman for sustainable development and the environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, tabled Bill 390, An Act to amend the Environmental Quality Act in order to assert the primacy of Quebec's competence in this area. 
This bill is the result of a number month legislative work to ask the Quebec government to assume its environmental skills. It is also a bill that is relaying the concerns of civil society and Quebeckers as to the control of their territory. "It's the culmination of a national affirmation approach. In 1962, being "masters at home", it was realized by the nationalization of electricity by René Lévesque. Today, Quebec must have all the necessary legislative tools to control its environmental and energy forward, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
Quebeckers have unfortunately not yet the full control of their territory, and we can not count on the National Energy Board or the federal government to ensure the defense of the environment. As a political formation, we come to the conclusion that it is by affirming the primacy of the jurisdiction of Quebec in this matter that Quebeckers will be able to guarantee the protection of the environment. "The energy project is not the values of Quebeckers, who do not want their territory to become a highway for the export of oil sands oil. Promacy to Quebec's environmental competence is to allow the Government of Quebeckers to say no to harmful projects for their natural wealth, "added the member for Jonquière. 
With this bill, the Parti Québécois continues its approach to reappropriation of power to Quebecers and to recognize the importance of rigorous environmental assessment.
