Quebec, June 9, 2017 - Today, the official opposition to the health, accessibility of home care and home support, Diane Lamarre, has filed a petition denouncing the increase in rates of Parking of health facilities in Quebec and their application to CHSLD, CLSC and other public services. 
IN SHORT 
Initiated by the Alliance of Professional and Technical Personnel for Health and Social Services (APTS), this petition denounces the policy submitted last summer by the Minister of Health, Ga√©tan Barrette, with respect to the parking lots of hospitals. It has had the effects of a significant increase in tariffs, and the application of tariffs to many previously free places, such as CHSLD and CLSC. 
"This policy has significant impacts, particularly in the region where users do not have the choice to take their car to go to the hospital, failing to have a public transportation service. There are also spouses, families and friends who visit a close in CHSLD, helping to break their isolation. Does the minister know that he creates a "disincistiff" to visit them? Also think of the most vulnerable people, often low-income, who have the most needs in health care; They will be penalized by this directive, "raised Diane Lamarre. 
"We hope that the Minister of Health will be sensitive to reality on the ground and that he will withdraw this unjust policy. Parking rates in the health network must not become a new disguised tax aimed at particular for Quebeckers who need more care or the presence of a loved one, "the spokesman.
