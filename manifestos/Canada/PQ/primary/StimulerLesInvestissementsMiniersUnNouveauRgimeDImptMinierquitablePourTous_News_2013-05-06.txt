Quebec- The Minister of Finance and Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau, and the Minister of Natural Resources, Mrs. Martine Ouellet, presented today's new Quebec mining tax system. "The government's ambition is to make Quebec one of the most prosperous places in the world, prioritizing private investment. This prosperity must benefit all Quebeckers. It is in this context that we present the new Quebec mining tax system, "said Minister Marceau. 
"Quebeckers were right to be dissatisfied with the Liberal regime as some companies could perpetuate the exploitation of natural resources without paying one hundred fees for a long time. In addition, when considerable profits were kept due to a sudden price increase, the share of profits paid in royalties did not know any increase. We present a fair royalty regime for citizens and ensures the completion of mining investment projects, "said the Minister of Finance. 
Ministers emphasized that the government brings two major initiatives to the mining tax system. First, it ensures that all mining farms will now be required to pay a mining tax, which was not the case so far. 
Now all mine operators in activity in Quebec will have to pay a minimum mining tax, applied to the value of the ore at the head of the well. To take into account the reality of the smaller operations and facilitating the start of mining projects, the levy rate will be 1% for the first $ 80 million in extracted ores. On the excess, the rate will be 4% of the value of extracted ores.
