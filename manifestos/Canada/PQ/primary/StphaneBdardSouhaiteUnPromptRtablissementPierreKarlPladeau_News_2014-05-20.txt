Quebec- The Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, confirms that the hon. Member for Saint-Jérôme, Pierre Karl Péladeau, will not be able to participate in the beginning of the work of the National Assembly because of a bike accident occurring this Sunday while he was circulating on a road from the Estrie region. 
"On behalf of all my colleagues members of the Parti Québécois, I wish a speedy recovery in Pierre Karl Péladeau. We hope to see it quickly by our side at the National Assembly but, by then, that it takes all the time needed to recover its strength, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
Pierre Karl Péladeau is currently hospitalized at the Sherbrooke University Hospital, suffering from several fractures. For the moment, no date of leave is planned. 
"I want to tell my colleagues that I anticipated with great emotion the beginning of parliamentary work. I wish my colleagues from the Parti Québécois, as well as to all members of the National Assembly, a very good return. Unfortunately, this bike accident will keep me home for a moment, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"That said, I remain very involved as to my role as a member of Saint-Jérôme, thanks to daily communication with the people of my riding. I will continue to take care of their records, as well as those of the parliamentary agenda. I finally want to thank the staff of the Sherbrooke University Hospital for the quality of care that gives me as well as for the good mood they spread around them, "added the member.
