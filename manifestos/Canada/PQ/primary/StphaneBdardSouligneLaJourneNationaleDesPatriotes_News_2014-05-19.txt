Quebec- The Leader of the Official Opposition invites the people to celebrate National Day of Patriots and to take advantage of it to remember the history of Quebec. 
"On this National Day of the Patriots, let us tribute to these women and men who have struggled for democracy. With courage, they defended their values and their convictions. Let us remember our history, marked by these struggles aimed at more solidarity and more freedom for our people. I invite all Quebeckers to celebrate together this significant festival, "said Stéphane Bédard.

It was in 2002 that the Government of Quebec proclaimed, by decree, the National Day of the Patriots, established on Monday preceding May 25 of each year. Thus, we wanted to better assert the events of May 1837 where the patriots held public meetings across Quebec after the refusal of the Government of London to accept their claims. The text of the decree stipulates that "this holiday will highlight the struggle of the patriots of 1837? 1838 for the national recognition of our people, for his political freedom and to obtain a system of democratic government".
