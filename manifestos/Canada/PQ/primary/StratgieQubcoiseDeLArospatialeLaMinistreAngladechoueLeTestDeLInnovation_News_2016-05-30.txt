Québec- The member for Sanguinet and spokespersons of the Parti Québécois in the field of economics, energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, is particularly disappointed with the 2016-2026 aerospace Question strategy. Unveiled this morning. 
"The strategy presented does not contain any new or innovative idea, no more than it sets a job creation objective. How does the government intend to measure success, without the establishment of a target? If the Liberal government itself doubts that its strategy will create jobs, how can Quebecers trust the Liberals to implement it? Let us remember Aerolia, a success of the Parti Québécois in terms of the attraction of large integrators. We had delivered, while the Liberals are content to promise or worse, to abandon the workers, as was the case for the 1800 Aveos, "deplored the member for Sanguinet. 
"Moreover, if the will, on paper, of the Liberal government to seek the share of Quebec in the federal defense contracts must be welcomed, it must be questioned that Quebec does not receive it naturally, and this, each once a federal contract is granted. Why should we ask, while 20% of the amounts spent comes from the taxes of Quebecers? In addition, does the federal government not support our aerospace sector, as it does for the automobile in Ontario, with a lot of funds? It was still the case in the last Morneau budget, "added the spokesman. 
"The Minister of Economy, Science and Innovation, Dominique Anglade, has clearly failed the test of innovation. Its aerospace strategy, which it had presented as to breathe confidence in the future to Quebeckers, is unfortunately a condensed commonplace, "concluded Alain Therien.
