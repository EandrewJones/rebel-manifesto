Quebec- The member for Marie-Victorin and the official opposition on energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, is worried about the Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, which minimizes the impacts and issues of Security related to the passage of superprternoliers on the St. Lawrence River. 
"If the federal government wants the St. Lawrence to become a highway to export Alberta's bituminous oil, Quebeckers have the right to say no. They even have the duty to say no, to protect our river and the integrity of our territory. It is to the Quebec government to say no on our behalf, "said Bernard Drainville. 
Today, in response to the member's questions, Philippe Couillard said: 
"Why is it a problem that a tanker increases from 32 to 44 meters - that's it, the number? - If we go from west to east or from east to west? What is this story? What is this salad, Mr. President? Â» 
"The lightness and casualness with which the Prime Minister considered the question today are disturbing. Just a year ago, only ships under 32 meters wide could circulate on the river. Philippe Couillard does not see any problem with what Ottawa has changed the regulation to allow larger oils, up to 44 meters, just pass on the river. However, the regulations adopted by the federal government is made to measure for the superbreakers. We are talking about giant ships whose hull passes less than one meter from the bottom of the river when they are loaded into two thirds, "said the member. 
"Does the Prime Minister understand that Quebeckers' drinking water reserve are talking about? Can the government explain why Quebec agrees to take this risk? Where is our interest? Why accept that the river becomes a simple export route for west oil? Asked Bernard Drainville.
