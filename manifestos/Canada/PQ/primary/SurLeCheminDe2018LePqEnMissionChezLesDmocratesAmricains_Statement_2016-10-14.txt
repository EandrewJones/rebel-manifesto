For a third consecutive election, a delegation of political organizers and citizen activists will cross the American border to achieve an educational and preparatory mission for the 2018 Quebec elections. 
This weekend, about fifteen delegates from the Quebec Party International Relations Committee (CRIPQ) will visit the Democrats of Manchester City in New Hampshire State. 
On the program, activists will be invited to experience land experience in the United States and to participate in voting release activities (GET Out The Vote - GOTV): Door Holder, Phone Calls, etc. 
In addition, participants will learn more about the organization in a democratic election campaign through training and meetings with different Democratic organizers. By trying to understand the social and political dynamics of New Hampshire, the organizers will seek to draw inspiration from the American method to apply it in the Quebec context. 
Since the involvement is at the heart of the vision of the Quebec's democracy, we will continue to set up the most modern electoral organization, assisted with state-of-the-art technological tools. More than ever, election preparation in the 2018 campaign begins now. 
And with the race behind us, the Parti Québécois now spends the word to the acts. 
Saturday at 8pm, join us for a live discussion of New Hampshire with the US Cripq Mission team! On the program, all about the American electoral organization, the state of mind of the democrats and practical applications for the Parti Québécois! It will also be happy to answer your questions! It's an appointment! -> http://go.pq.org/rd5
