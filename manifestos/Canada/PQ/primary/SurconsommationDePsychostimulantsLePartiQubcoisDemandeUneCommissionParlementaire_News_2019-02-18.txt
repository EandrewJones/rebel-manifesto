Quebec, February 18, 2019 -The MP for Jonquiere and spokesperson for the Second Opposition Group in Health, Sylvain Gaudreault, accompanied by pediatricians Jean-Benoît Bouchard, Guy Falarceau, Valérie Labbé and Pierre Claude Poulin, asked The Health and Social Services Commission (CSSS) to bring an initiative mandate to ensure that its members can look at overconsumption of drugs to regularize ADHD. 
IN SHORT 
"We know that since the turn of the 2000s, in Quebec, the consumption of drugs against the deficit disorder with hyperactivity, the famous ADHD, exploded. Why, exactly? Why does psychological distress seem more marked in young Quebeckers? , Is worried Sylvain Gaudreault. 
Sharing this concern last January, nearly fifty pediatricians have a concert sounded the alarm and denounces the use too fast and too easy to medicines to treat the symptoms of ADHD. Today, other pediatricians join this group and propose concrete solutions to reduce overconsumption of psychostimulants: the establishment of a study committee bringing together the ministries of health and education, the Improved psychosocial services, a reflection on evaluation questionnaires and the guidelines that define ADHD, as well as an increased offer of physical activity for young people, among others. 
According to Sylvain Gaudreault, parliamentarians must imperatively look at the solution tracks that these specialists advance. "We want the members of the Commission to be able to hear experts in this area to take stock of this situation more than a concern. It's health and quality of life of our young people; This is why I ask other parties to support our application for the holding of this parliamentary committee, "he claimed.
