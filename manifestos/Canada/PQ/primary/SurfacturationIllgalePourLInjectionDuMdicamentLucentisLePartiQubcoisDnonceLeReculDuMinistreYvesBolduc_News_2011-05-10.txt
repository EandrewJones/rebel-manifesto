Quebec -The MP for Taschereau and Official Opposition Spokesman for Health, Agnès Maltese, is a stomach of the new orientation of the Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, who no longer has a specific timeline so that ceases illegal surfacturation for the injection of the Lucentis drug. 
"In February, Minister Bolduc promised to put an end to this illegal surfacting practice in the coming days. Three months later, it is now unable to keep promise and muffs with hollow and unconvincing sentences. Meanwhile, thousands of people are victims of the minister's inaction. It's unacceptable, "said Agnès Maltais. 
This afternoon at the National Assembly, the member for Taschereau filed a petition of 3700 signatories demanding the end of this illegal surfacturation, in the presence of people with macular degeneration. To date, more than 4200 people claimed the intervention of the minister. 
"The words of Minister Bolduc have nothing to reassure these people. Rather than sending a clear directive to the Health Network or the Quebec Health Insurance Régie so that this practice ceases, it is now waiting for an action plan of each institution. Worse, people with macular degeneration are at the center of a negotiation they charge, the minister who himself admits that he takes this opportunity to negotiate with the medical federations on ancillary fees. It is shameful. The view of thousands of people is at risk, "Ms. Maltais denounced. 
"Yves Bolduc must stop acting in technocrat and realize that by its inaction thousands of people suffer. It is his first duty to preserve the health of the citizens and to enforce our laws by ending now to the illegal surfacturation practiced since 2009 for this type of treatment, "Agnès Maltais concluded.
