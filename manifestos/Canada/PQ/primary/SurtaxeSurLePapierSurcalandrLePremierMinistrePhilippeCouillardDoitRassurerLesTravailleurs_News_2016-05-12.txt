Quebec- In the company of representatives of the forest workers of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region, including several of Kenogami and Dolbeau-Mistassini factories, the member for Jonqui√®re and Official Opposition Leader, Sylvain Gaudreault, As well as the member for Bonaventure and spokesperson for the Quebecois on forests, Sylvain Roy, insisted that the Prime Minister act quickly in the export file that afflicts the producers of paper-based paper, and reassuring the workers. 
"In last October, the US Department of Commerce determined that Quebec producers of paper-based paper should pay a surcharge. Kenogami's factories, Saguenay, and Dolbeau-Mistassini, Lac-Saint-Jean, have since paid a tax of 18% on the paper they export to the United States. It represents additional costs, for each, more than $ 1 million a month. The situation becomes dangerous for the future of these two factories in my region, also that of the Prime Minister. Workers are with us today and they are worried. The Prime Minister said there was a delay on the federal side. It does not seem to realize that the situation is serious. He must reassure workers, act with diligence and with force. I remind him of the closure of Graphic Packaging, last summer, who could have been avoided if he had acted, "said Sylvain Gaudreault. 
"Since 2005, it's more than 20,000 direct jobs that have been lost in the processing of wood. Some 286 factories have closed their doors. There are two others on who weighs a very serious threat. A closure, even temporary, could allow American competitors to take the market of our factories. The Minister of Forests must take responsibility and ask Ottawa to cancel this surcharge, which threatens forest communities in Quebec, "says Sylvain Roy.
