Québec- The member for Terrebonne and official opposition on the family, Mathieu Traversy, strongly denounces the decision of the Minister of the Family, Francine Charbonneau, desuspend to the allocation of new spaces in child care. 
"Parents are waiting for these places and care are preparing to make them available. It is totally unacceptable to suspend all this process. The Liberal Party has never spoken about this in the election campaign; It is again the good old liberal recipe. The families of Quebec should have known what was waiting for them, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
In addition to not allowing the 15,000 places of the last call for tenders, the minister goes so far as to suspend those of the previous call for tenders, launched by the Liberal government in 2011. 
"When we arrived in power, we accelerated the award of places, since there was a significant delay. The story is likely to be repeated. We have no assurance that these places will not be simply canceled. It is totally irresponsible; Families from all regions of Quebec are waiting for places, "said the member for Terrebonne. 
The minister must tell the network what awaits it. CPEs and subsidized daycares have received their promises to attribute places. A whole process is started by the teams of these institutions; The freezing will cause worry throughout the network. 
"Let's not forget that the last time a Liberal government delayed the allocation of child care places, there was the scandal of liberal daycare. The minister must immediately reassure parents who are waiting for a place and the entire child care network, "continued Mathieu Traversy. 
"See the development of the child care network as an expense is a simplistic vision, concluded the member for Terrebonne. Developing places is to encourage job creation in all regions, promote work-family reconciliation and facilitate the arrival of young parents, especially women, in the labor market. This development should not be braked. »
