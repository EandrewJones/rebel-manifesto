Quebec- The member for Joliette and sentence of the official opposition in the field of justice, Véronique Hivon, denounces the Fiasco of the Integrated Justice Information System (SIIJ) which, because of the incompetence of the Government, cost $ 75 million to Quebecers without any results. 
"Yesterday, we learned that the government suspended the project of creation of a SIIJ, even if the latter has already cost $ 75 million. This announcement is the newest development of a saga that has lasted for years and has been marked by liberal incompetence at all stages. There has been a change of approach in 2004, then a call for tenders in 2006, then a suspension of the project and another call for tenders in 2010. In 2012, while $ 75 million of the $ 105 million authorized for This project has already been committed, only 20% of the project is developed! In the meantime, the Auditor General did not fail to denounce the SIIJ was not managed with the sake of economy and efficiency, "Véronique Hivon recalled. 
On several occasions, the official opposition spokesman asked the government about the SIIJ. "In the spring of 2011, I questioned the Minister of Justice on the progress of the work of the SIIJ and he replied that the project was on track of achievement, that it was satisfied with the progress of the work. However, less than a year later, the President of the Treasury Board suspends the project because it is doomed to failure. Why did the Minister of Justice show so much laxity in this case? How could he have a waste of $ 75 million while his department should be content with just 1% of the overall state budget and that access needs for justice are screaming? The minister regularly relies on the lack of resources to refuse to meet the demands of victims and groups working for access to justice. With this SIIJ scandal, we are entitled to wonder how the Minister Fournier manages his ministry and priorities, "Concluded Véronique Hivon.
