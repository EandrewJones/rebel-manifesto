Québec- Following the alleged remarks of the Minister of Transport, Jacques Daoust, reported by the former president of Rona, Robert Dutton, on the 98.5 FM waves on the Dutrizac issue, the Parliamentary Leader of the Opposition Official, Bernard Drainville, reiterated the request of the Parti Québécois: Minister Jacques Daoust must leave office. 
During a meeting with Mr. Dutton in August 2012, Minister Jacques Daoust, then to Investisse Québec, would have said: 
"I do not want to know about Rona. I'm going to lose my job; All that interests me is to have a vineyard pis you are better to give me a good price. Because I'm going to make big renovations and I want to have good prices on my vineyard. » 
"It does not finish, with Minister Daoust. The only thing that interests him, when we were going to lose a head office, it's his vineyard? These remarks are added to all the bounds of this minister. Whether at Investisse Québec, as Minister of the Economy or Minister of Transport, the problems accumulate around him. He should no longer have the confidence of the Prime Minister, "said Bernard Drainville.
