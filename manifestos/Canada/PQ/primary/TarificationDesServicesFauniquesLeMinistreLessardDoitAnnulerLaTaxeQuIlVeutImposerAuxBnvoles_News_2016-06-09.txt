Quebec- with two stakeholders from the Saguenay watershed organization, the member for Bonaventure and spokesman for the Quebec's forest, wildlife and parks, Sylvain Roy, and the member for Chicoutimi, Mireille Jean , urged the Liberal government to cancel the new wildlife pricing that it wishes to impose on volunteer organizations. 
"The regulation proposed by the government is an unprecedented attack on volunteering in Quebec. The new tariffs for wildlife permits make no distinction between a non-profit organization, an NPO, and a tanker who wants, for example, to develop a spawning ground. NPOs will have to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars to carry out a complementary work to that of the department. For example, it will cost $ 506 to develop a fish habitat, an amount that is a good part of the annual budget of certain organizations. This is unacceptable! "Denounced the hon. Member for Bonaventure. 
"Volunteers who carry out wildlife management on our streams do it with heart, and for the benefit of the entire community. For what reasons does the government want to kill citizens' initiatives in our regions? Are the Liberals not aware of the additional expenditures that for the government should assume the entire costs of the work done by volunteers? The minister must cancel these tariffs for volunteers! , "Added Mireille John.
