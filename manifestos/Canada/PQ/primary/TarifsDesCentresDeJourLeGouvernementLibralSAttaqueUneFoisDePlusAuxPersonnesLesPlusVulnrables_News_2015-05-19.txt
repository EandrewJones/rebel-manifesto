Quebec- The member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, Jean-François Lisée, denounces the raising rise in tariffs that the government plans to impose on seniors and persons with disabilities, among others for the service of Adapted transportation allowing them to attend the day centers of the health and social services network of Quebec. 
"Day centers are places where seniors and people with disabilities go a few times a week to help keep autonomy. The fact that these people remain at home cheaper to Quebec society and, above all, that's what they want. The adapted transportation service could cost the equivalent of a metro ticket, approximately. But we learn that it will increase to $ 10 for everyone. Why does the government impose such a tariff shock to seniors and people with disabilities in Quebec? It is indefensible, "said Jean-François Lisée. 
The hon. Member stresses that in December, the Prime Minister had committed to no longer increase the rates to achieve a balanced budget, admitting that taxpayers had done more than their fair share. In this case, however, we are talking about up to 600% for adapted transportation, and up to 87% for meals offered in daylight centers. "What happened to the good intentions of Philippe Couillard? Let us remember how the Minister of Health and Social Services, Gaétan Barrette, had to retreat in the CHSLD rate file; Currently, we really feel that he wants to reflect the lack to win elders and people with disabilities, "he added. 
"Day centers are beneficial for both patients and their caregivers, who find a little respite. The Prime Minister must make reason to Gaétan barrette and summon it to give up these increase in unacceptable tariffs, "concluded Jean-François Lisée.
