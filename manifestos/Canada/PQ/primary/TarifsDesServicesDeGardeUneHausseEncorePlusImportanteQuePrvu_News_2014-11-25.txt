Québec- The member for Rousseau and the official opposition spokeswoman in finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, deplores the improvisation of the Liberal government in the dossier of child care rates. First, he broke his promise, made in election campaign, only to index the rates. Then we learn that nothing has been formally agreed with Ottawa in terms of the inclusion of federal tax credits. 
"To increase the tariff shock pill that it will impose on middle-class families, the government has indicated that it will be entitled to the federal child care tax credits. But we learned this morning that the Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, did not attach anything with Ottawa. He improvised and, again, he put his prime minister in the embarrassment by making him promise highly hypothetical amounts. This government broke its promise, it will tax families and, in addition, it says anything to the population, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
The member recalled that several tax experts consider that the portion of the amount invoiced to parents for child care through their income statements would not be eligible for federal tax credits. Asked about this, the minister admitted that he had not attached anything with Ottawa, adding that he did not have to do so. 
"For a family, in addition to the increase announced by the government, it could mean an additional amount of more than $ 1,000. How can the government present reduced increases by tax credits, while formally, nothing is planned? What do families do? Provide a big family tax or a very big family tax? ", Concluded Nicolas Marceau.
