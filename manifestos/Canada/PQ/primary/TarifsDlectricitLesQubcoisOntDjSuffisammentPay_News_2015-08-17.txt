Quebec- The member for Rousseau and the official opposition spokeswoman in the field of finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, as well as the member for Marie-Victorin and Word in Energy and Natural Resources, Bernard Drainville Asking the government to take a clear position and say whether it counts, yes or no, follow up on the recommendations of the GODBOUT report, which advocates a real explosion of electricity rates. 
"It has been confirmed this morning: the bad receivables reach a record level. There have never been so many Quebec families who are struggling to pay their electricity bill. With increases of more than 20% imposed by the last liberal governments since 2004, it is no longer solely the poorest families who can no longer pay their electricity bill, they are also the families of the middle class. What will happen to them if the government follows the recommendations of the GODBOUT report and further increases 12.6% rates, in addition to imposing a new tax of 10% on overconsumption? Do Philippe Couillard and his ministers will soon understand that the middle class can not provide more? Nicolas Marceau asked Nicolas Marceau. 
Bernard Drainville abounds in the same direction. "Hydro-Québec must put an end to certain indecent practices and quite unjust for Quebeckers. For example, it is urgent that subscribers cease to pay succession fees, new generation counters no longer requiring manual succession. Hydro-Québec thus unduly pockets $ 67 million a year, "he illustrated. In addition, the annual interest rate of 14.4% that the Crown corporation imposes families with the difficulty of paying their electricity bill is completely unreasonable and must be revised downward. Hydro-Québec belongs to all Quebeckers, after all; Do not forget it. »
