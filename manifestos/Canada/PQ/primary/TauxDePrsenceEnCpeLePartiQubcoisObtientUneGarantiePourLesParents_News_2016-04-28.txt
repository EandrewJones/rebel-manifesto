Quebec, April 28, 2016 - The member for Labelle and spokesperson for the Quebecois family, Sylvain Pagé, asked this morning the Minister of Family, Sébastien Proulx, on his decision to impose on each CPE the target 80% of the attendance rate, without distinction of results already obtained and without taking into account the reality of the environment. 
"Mr. Proulx has understood that for a CPE whose presence rate is already above 80%, there is no problem. On the other hand, for a CPE that welcomes more vulnerable or sick children, whose parents are separated or have to deal with atypical schedules, the target can be difficult to reach. Fear of threat of financial cuts by the department, some CPEs have already sent a directive that worries parents, "said the member for Labelle. 
The directive in question goes as follows: 
"When the number of days of absence of the child reaches the permitted limit, the following procedure will be applied.  A written notice will be sent to parents by registered mail to terminate the service agreement with a 2-week notice. » 
Tuesday, in a press point, the member for Labelle, accompanied by disconcerted parents, had already attracted the attention of the minister and the public to the consequences of this measure for families whose children must be absent more often. Today, Minister Sebastien Proulx said that "CPEs could not put an end to a service agreement because of an insufficient presence rate." 
"I am reassured for the parents that the minister finally heard right. That said, we will remain vigilant. We must ensure that this measure put forward does not cause other concerns to parents, "concluded Sylvain Pagé.
