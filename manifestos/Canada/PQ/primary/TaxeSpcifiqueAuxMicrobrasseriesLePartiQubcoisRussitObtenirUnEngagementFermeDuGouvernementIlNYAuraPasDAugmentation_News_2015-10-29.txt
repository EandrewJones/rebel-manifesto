Quebec - While the Quebec microbreweries sector continues its strong expansion, and that the talent of their craftsmen is increasingly recognized around the world, anxiety remained: we feared an increase in the specific tax imposed on the purchase of Their products, as recommended by the GODBOUT report. This morning, in front of the insistence of the Parti Québécois, the Liberal government firmly committed to no increase in this tax. 
It will be remembered that the report of the Quebec Tax Review Board recommended increasing the specific tax for microbreweries. "It was just foolish to consider rising this tax. The microbreweries sector, in Quebec, it is 130 companies and some 3800 direct jobs. Often, they were created by young entrepreneurs who come back or settle in the region to actively contribute to the development of them. Quebec needs them; They energize and value our regions, in addition to doing our pride around the world, "said Gaétan Lelièvre, spokesman for the Regional Development and Treasury Board. 
"On the part of a government, it was totally irresponsible to allow a doubt about a possible increase in taxes for these companies in particular. Across Quebec, microbrewers have suspended their investments while waiting to see what the Liberals would do. These very legitimate fears were easily understood, and our party had to defend the interests of these companies. That the government finally committed not to increase the tax is good news, "added the member. 
It also recalled that it is under the impetus of a government of the Parti Québécois that the microbreweries sector has had a great boom, starting in 1996, until today, one of the jewels Quebec's know-how. "The products of our microbrewers regularly have prestigious prizes during international brewing competitions. They are among the best in the world. The government must continue to make all the necessary support, "concluded Gaétan Lelièvre.
