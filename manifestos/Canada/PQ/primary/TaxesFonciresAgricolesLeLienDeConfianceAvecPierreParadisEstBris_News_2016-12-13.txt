Quebec, December 13, 2016 -The Parti Québécois spokesperson in agriculture, André Villeneuve, notes, once again, that the trust between farmers and Minister Pierre Paradis is broken. Indeed, Monday, the Union of Agricultural Farmers (UPA) has put the Government of Quebec as a result of the changes planned for the agricultural land tax credit program. 
"When farmers have rendered the government, it demonstrates the depth of their misunderstanding. For months, we have been eating out, alongside farmers, to denounce the impacts of changes to the Liberal government tax program. Pierre Paradis's only answer was to make fun of farmers by dealing with liars not knowing. The farce has lasted enough, "said André Villeneuve. 
The calculations of the UPA, based on the MAPAQ figures, demonstrate that among the 83% of farmers who will raise taxes, many will have to pay thousands of dollars more, for an average increase ranging from 30% to 40% to 40 %. This analysis has been confirmed by an independent study of Forest Lavoie, commissioned by the Federated Coop. 
"Minister Paradis has misleaded farmers. In the taxes file as in many others, he lost the confidence of the agricultural community. The Prime Minister must take note of it and do the necessary: to withdraw at Pierre Paradis his duties, "concluded the member.
