Quebec, on December 19, 2016 - After the Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, had suggested using an expert to measure the impact of his reform of the agricultural land tax credit program, the Quebec party. In the area of agriculture, André Villeneuve, reacted by proposing that the appointment of the said expert is the result of a joint recommendation from the Union of Agricultural Farmers (UPA) and the Government. 
"The Liberal government broke the trust link that united it to farmers, even going to treat them with liars. The announcement of the minister, this week, is more of panic than a real good will, "says André Villeneuve. 
Remember that the figures put forward by the UPA - that 83% of farmers will undergo a tax increase of 30% to 40% on average - have been confirmed by a study by Forest Lavoie, commanded by the Federated Coop. "The Minister has no credibility; We maintain it must resign. However, if the government wishes to appoint an expert to measure the impacts of this bad reform on the ground, the least of things is that this expert is recognized by the farmers, "concluded the member for Berthier.
