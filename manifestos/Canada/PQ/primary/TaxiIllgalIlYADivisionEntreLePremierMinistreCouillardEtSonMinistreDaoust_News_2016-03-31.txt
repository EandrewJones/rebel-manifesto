Quebec- MP Martine Ouellet, spokesman for the Parti Quebec's transport, maritime strategy, transport electrification and digital strategy, denounces the interference of Prime Minister Couillard, which prevents his Transport Minister Jacques Daoust , to act to counter the illegal taxi by blocking the filing of his bill. 
"After Robert Poëti, it is now the turn of Jacques Daoust to bury the interference of Prime Minister Philippe Couillard in the illegal taxi file. The two transport ministers, Mr. Poëti in the fall of 2014 and Mr. Daoust this winter, said in parliamentary committee that Duberx was doing unlawful transport. During Uber's appearance last February, Minister Daoust wondered how the company could wait to have abused the system 450,000 times in a month. " There is only the prime minister who protects the foreign multinational by bonding the illegal taxi. Why does the Prime Minister strike constantly in favor of Uber, even going against the will of his own ministers? Why does Mr. Couillard tolerate the illegality of Uberx, to the detriment of 20,000 Quebec workers? , Asked the hon. Member for Vachon. 
While the Prime Minister's office is obstruction, the reality on the ground continues to deteriorate. Still last week, a judge refused to put their vehicle back to the recidivist drivers, believing that the currently required deposit was insufficient to counter the illegal taxi. 
"The Prime Minister is now the sole responsibility of the disturbances we know. It has been allowing the situation for several months already. It is more than time that Philippe Couillard leaves his minister of transport doing his work and enforce the law. The government can act now, whether by injunction, as in Calgary, or by calling on Bill 593 to counter the illegal taxi, tabled on February 18th. We also offer all our collaboration for the study of a bill that would modernize the taxis law, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
