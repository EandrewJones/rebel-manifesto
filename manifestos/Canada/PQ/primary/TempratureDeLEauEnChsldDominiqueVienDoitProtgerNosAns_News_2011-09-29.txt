Quebec- The member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and the official opposition for seniors, Carole Poirier, would like to remind Minister Delegate to Social Services, Dominique Vien, that the security of seniors is essential and that meaning, a clear message must be heard by Quebec's CHSLD as to the temperature of the water. 
"Despite two deaths by burns at the Manoir-de-L'Aest-de-l'ÃŽle in Montreal, the minister has still not issued a directive. Even after a first report of the coroner stipulating that it was the temperature of the water that was involved and that it was necessary to remedy quickly to the situation, no follow-up was made. How much does the minister finally settle this file? "Asked Carole Poirier. 
"Rather than contradicting the protector of the citizen who has made a very rigorous analysis of the file and who found that there was a serious problem, the minister must act without delay to make such a situation again. We can not tolerate that our elders may burn dangerously, sometimes until death, taking their bath. It is necessary that a 40-degree ceiling is imposed, as recommended by the Protector of the Citizen and Coroner, "said Carole Poirier. 
The Protector of the Citizen, both in his annual report and at the press conference this morning, has been categorical: 
"The minister must quickly understand what the demand for the Protector of the Citizen is and to take action," concluded Carole Poirier.
