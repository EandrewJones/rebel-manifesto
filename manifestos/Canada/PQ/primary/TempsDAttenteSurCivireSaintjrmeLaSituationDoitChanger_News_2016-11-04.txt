Québec- We learn today that the average waiting time on stretcher at the Saint-Jérôme Regional Hospital is one of the worst in Quebec. While the national average is 15.3 hours, the citizens of Saint-Jérôme are waiting for 24.1 hours, nearly 9 hours more. Diane Lamarre, spokesperson for the Quebec's health, accessibility of care and home support, denounces once again the situation, which she qualifies as unacceptable. 
"Today even at the urgency of Saint-Jérôme Hospital, 14 people have been waiting for stretchers for at least 24 hours, and for more than 48 hours! It's indecent. The citizens of Saint-Jérôme fed 4:08 on average before even being able to see a doctor at the urgency in 2015-2016, almost twice as long as the Quebec average, which is 2:18. We have the Printing that the government is not sensitive to the health situation in the Laurentians! Denounced Diane Lamarre. 
"Rather than improving patient services, as he had promised to do so, the Liberal Party has deteriorated them. However, the solutions are before and after. Before, on the front line, where specialized nurse practitioners could heal minor problems independently; And after, with a real home support policy for vulnerable people. With centralization, compressions in services and rising physician remuneration, the patient has been forgotten, which is always losing. The Liberal candidate, Naömie Goyette, should apologize with Jéômians and Jéômians for this new failure of barrette reform, "concluded the spokesperson.
