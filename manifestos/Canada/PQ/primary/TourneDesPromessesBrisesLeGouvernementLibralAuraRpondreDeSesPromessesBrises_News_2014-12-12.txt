Quebec, December 12, 2014 - The member for Terrebonne and the official opposition on the family, Mathieu Traversy, takes advantage of the end of the tour of broken promises, organized by the Quebec Association of CPEs, to reaffirm The support of the Parti Québécois party to families, family policy and the Quebec Care Network. 
"The Liberal government deliberately broke the promises made to Quebec families. While it promised, in the election campaign, not to increase child care rates beyond inflation, it imposes a significant tariff shock for families. In addition, the development of places is braked throughout Quebec. These austerity measures will have significant consequences. Quebeckers did not vote for that; The government has intentionally broke the trusted link, "said Mathieu Traversy. 
"Liberal members have had the opportunity to bring the families' voice of their constituencies at the National Assembly. Having preferred to endorse the broken promises of Philippe Couillard, we invite them, during the holiday season, to talk to families and explain why they broke their promises, "added the member for Terrebonne. 
CPE projects compromised by the reform of the Minister of Family  The MP is also worried about delays and the cancellation of several CPE projects, particularly in disadvantaged, due to changes in the infrastructure financing program. From now on, CPEs will have to provide 50% of the sums necessary for the realization of new projects, which greatly compromises the development of places. 
"How long, money and energy will have been spent in vain because of Francine Charbonneau minister? The child care community states that the majority of projects are compromised. By its reform, the minister pushes projects in the hands of the private network, painting the public network. I invite him to take new resolutions for 2015, to reconnect with the network and to act in the interest of the families of Quebec, "concluded Mathieu Traversy.
