The Tuque - on the occasion of an exceptional tour of the members of the Parti Québécois government in the regions of Mauricie and Center-du-Québec, the Minister of Natural Resources, Mrs. Martine Ouellet, announced an investment of 3 million dollars in the acquisition of knowledge of mineral resources in the gouin tank sector, northwest of the tuque. 
"The territory of Mauricie covers nearly 40,000 km2 and has great natural riches. This $ 3 million investment will acquire knowledge about the geology of the Mauricie region, "said Martine Ouellet. 
In 2012-2013, the Ministry of Natural Resources collaborated with the city of the Tuque to the realization of a geological recognition project in the Gouin tank sector. Over the next six years, the Department will invest $ 3 million in continuing knowledge acquisition on mineral resources in the territory. This work will be used to better document the mineral resources that the region has. Aeromagnetic surveys will be carried out in 2014 and 2015 in the Gouin Reservoir sector and the mapping work will extend until 2020. This geological work will be done in collaboration with the Atikamekw communities in the region. 
The members of the Parti Québécois and the government ministers will meet on February 5 and 6 in Shawinigan, on the occasion of the Caucus of MPs and the Council of Ministers. They will benefit from this meeting to tour nine constituencies in the Mauricie region and the Center-du-Québec region. In less than a week, they will do more than 80 advertisements of different orders. These ads will contribute to the development and growth of the regions of Mauricie and Center-du-Québec.
