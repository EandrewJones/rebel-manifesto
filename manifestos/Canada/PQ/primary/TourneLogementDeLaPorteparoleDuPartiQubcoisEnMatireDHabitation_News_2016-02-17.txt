Quebec- This week, the hon. Member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and Quebec's Word of Party in terms of housing, Carole Poirier, meet various housing organizations in Greater Montreal, as part of a tour having themed housing theme social. 
"There are 6,000 licensed and financed housing units, and the Liberal government has decided to reduce from 3000 to 1500 the number of units that will be carried out in 2015-2016. Why block the development of as many units, while the needs are patent? Why do so many units remain waiting? Which step are these units rendered? What are the major obstacles encountered by the groups? I'm trying to understand, and I want to make a clear picture of the social housing situation to demonstrate to the Liberal government that it is wrong, and that slowing the development of community social housing for private benefit is not the solution On the contrary, "said Carole Poirier, after a meeting with two important groups in the field of housing together in Saint-Eustache. 
The member recalled that the AccessLogis Québec program, which has existed since 1996, aims to promote the realization of social and community housing for modest or low-income households, or to the clienteles in difficulty with special needs. It asks, among other things, that its annual funding, amputated by the Liberal government, which is fully restored. 
Carole Poirier continues his tourism tour until Sunday; It will also visit groups in Montérégie, Laurentians and Gatineau.
