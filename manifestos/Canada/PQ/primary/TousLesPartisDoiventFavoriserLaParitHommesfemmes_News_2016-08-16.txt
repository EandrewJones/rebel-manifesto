Quebec, August 16, 2016 -The Member of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesman for the Quebecois Party on the matter of women, Carole Poirier, is sorry for the fact that young liberals rejected a resolution that their party undertakes to present Between 40% and 60% female applications with each election. 
"As members of the National Assembly of Quebec, we have the obligation to move towards a representativeness of the entire population. However, for too long, women are saying that the changes will arrive one day or another. At the Parti Québécois, we believe that concrete and daring gestures must be made from the next election, in 2018, "said Carole Poirier. 
The member stated to the elected officials of the Liberal Party that their former chief, Jean Charest, yet signed the Manifesto for the parity of the Women, Politics and Democracy Group. In addition, last March, a Liberal MP filed an initiative to consider the place occupied by women in politics. "The position of the young liberals is totally illogical and contradictory. What should we think about it? On the side of the Parti Québécois, on the other hand, we are consistent: In November 2015, our National Council adopted the following resolution: "It is proposed that the next government of the Parti Québécois applies parity during the training of the Council of Ministers." Moreover, our national executive is already parity. " 
In addition, to reach the parity in politics and within the decision-making apparatus, the Parti Québécois took, last March, the following 10 commitments: 
"The Prime Minister delegated to the Status of Women was Lise Payette, in 1979. Nearly 40 years later, we find that the place of women in politics has been strengthened, but that we can do more. The Parti Québécois intends to take responsibility; It will continue to embody the change for Quebec women, because the future of our nation goes through equality between women and men, "concluded Carole Poirier.
