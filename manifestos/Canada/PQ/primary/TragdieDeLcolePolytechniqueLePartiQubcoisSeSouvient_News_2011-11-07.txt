Quebec - "On the occasion of the 22nd anniversary of the Polytechnic School drama, the Parti Quebecker wishes to commemorate this event in memory of the 14 young women victims of an act still incomprehensible and unacceptable after all these years. This drama lived by the families of the victims should not be forgotten and the struggles that they conducted later should not be vain, "said the member for Marguerite-d'youville and spokesperson for the official opposition. In terms of women's condition, Monique Richard. 
"While all Quebec commemorates this drama, it is deplorable to note that the Government of Canada persists in wanting to abolish the Firearms Register," added the member for Marie-Victorin and the official opposition spokesman. Canadian intergovernmental business, Bernard Drainville. 
It will be remembered that it is following the tragedy of the Polytechnic School that an unprecedented mobilization led by the relatives of the victims had brought the federal government to set up a firearms register. 
"Since 2006, the National Assembly of Quebec has adopted seven unanimous motions to require the full maintenance of the register and the protection of data from Quebec. The National Assembly asked the Quebec Firearms Controller to take all measures to protect the data. It is imperative that the data be preserved to protect the registry in Quebec. In front of the Canadian government's intransigence, the Government of Quebec must bring a legal remedy to prevent the destruction of data, "concluded the member for Verchères and the official opposition spokesperson for public safety, Stéphane Bergeron.
