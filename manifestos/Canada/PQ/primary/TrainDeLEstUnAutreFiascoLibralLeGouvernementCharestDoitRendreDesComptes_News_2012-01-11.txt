Quebec- "How could we record a cost overrun of nearly half a billion dollars compared to the East Train project announced by Prime Minister Jean Charest in 2006 without anyone getting the bell alarm? Â» 
This is the question posed by the member for Gouin and the official opposition spokesman, Nicolas Girard, after reading the new revelations published this morning in the newspaper the press. It is learned that the initial project provided for a $ 300 million disbursement for the Eastern Train. However, according to the new estimates, the project risks rather to cost more than double or even triple. 
"There is someone somewhere who did not do his job properly. With this further overtaking, it will cost taxpayers more than the extension of the metro in Laval, "added Nicolas Girard. 
Tunnel Mont-Royal: Minister Moreau must be explained 
On several occasions last fall, the member for Gouin questioned the Minister of Transport, Pierre Moreau, on the security of the Mont-Royal tunnel which has no emergency exit and has no device in case of 'fire. MP Girard claimed a notice from the Fire Department of the City of Montreal, which Minister Moreau refused. 
"Minister Moreau supported the beak and nails that there would be no compromise on the safety of citizens and users, but did not worry about the lack of emergency exit. Now we have learned last December that the Fire Department of the City of Montreal has rang the alarm and worries about this reality. Since it has in the hands of such a notice for almost two months, Pierre Moreau must now tell us whether the tunnel is always so safe in the current state, as it has been affirmed once again at the National Assembly, "has concluded Nicolas Girard.
