Quebec- The hon. Member for Vachon and spokesperson for the official opposition on shale mines and gas, Martine Ouellet, is concerned about the results of the study commissioned by the Auditor General of Quebec regarding the treatment of water from Schist gas fracturing. "The findings of Raymond van Coillie's analysis are very disturbing for the health of citizens of Quebec. Municipal sewage plants are simply not designed to treat wastewater from hydraulic fracturing, "worked with the official opposition spokesperson. 
"This is another demonstration of the Improvisation and Amateurism of the Liberal government in its management of the shale gas file. Waters from hydraulic fracturing contain metals and radioactive elements that can reduce the treatment capacity of the treatment plants thus jeopardizing the quality of drinking water and the health of the population. It's extremely alarming, "said Martine Ouellet. 
"The researcher at the Université de Sherbrooke is categorical. The attitude of the Liberal government as to the possibility for municipalities to treat the soiled water of hydraulic fracturing is absolutely inappropriate. From now on, this government has the obligation to put the necessary gestures to ensure the sustainability of our water, "added the member for Vachon. 
"The Parti Québécois requires an immediate moratorium on the exploration and exploitation of shale gases including any hydraulic fracturing activity in the territory. The conclusions of Raymond van Coillie reinforce our position and the will of hundreds of Quebec citizens to block the road to the learned wizards of the gas industry, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
