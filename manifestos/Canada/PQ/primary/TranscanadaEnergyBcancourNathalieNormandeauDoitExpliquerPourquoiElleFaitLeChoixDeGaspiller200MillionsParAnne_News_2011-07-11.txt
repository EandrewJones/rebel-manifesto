Quebec -The Parti Quebecism calls for transparency on the part of the Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, in order to make public the agreement with TransCanada Energy. The initial application was formulated at the National Assembly on May 4, 2010. Minister Normandeau had taken note and undertook to respond to this request. Later, she invoked commercial information to avoid transparency. 
"It's always the same story: we are calling for commercial secrets to avoid transparency. However, this plant, built since 2004, costs more than it pays to Quebeckers. Nathalie Normandeau has the obligation to unveil the details of the agreement with its government with the company. It must assess the possibility of ending this contract that costs $ 200 million a year to Quebecers, without any profit, "said the member for Jonquière and spokesperson for the official energy opposition, Sylvain Gaudreault . 
On several occasions since 2008, the member for Jonquière has intervened in order to obtain clarification from the Liberal government about this gas plant in Bécancour, a real white elephant, but in vain. 
The failure of the liberal energy strategy 
For the Parti Québécois, the Bécancour gas plant perfectly illustrates the failure of the energy strategy of the Liberal government and the poor Planning of Hydro-Québec and Thierry Vandal. "When you have to offset a company for $ 200 million a year because you do not need its energy and at the same time you juggle with the idea of restoring a nuclear power plant next door for a Minimum cost of $ 2 billion is a blatant sign of an improvising government, "denounced Mr. Gaudreault. 
"The current energy strategy of Quebec is an important obstacle for Quebeckers to be masters of their resources. The Liberal government must show transparency, but it must also return to its drawing table to rewrite an energy strategy that will better meet the aspirations and will of Quebeckers, "concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
