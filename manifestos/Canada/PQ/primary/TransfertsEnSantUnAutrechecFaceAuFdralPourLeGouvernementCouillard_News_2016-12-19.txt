Quebec, On December 19, 2016 -The Parti Québécois spokesperson for Finance and Relations Québec-Canada, Nicolas Marceau, notes another failure from the Couillard Government to the Trudeau Government, which refuses to maintain health transfers to a annual rate of 6%, without conditions. 
The 3% reduction in health transfers will lose $ 13.7 billion to Quebecers in 10 years. 
"We have another proof of the failure of cooperative federalism advocated by the Prime Minister of Quebec, in addition to another confirmation that Justin Trudeau does nothing more than Stephen Harper for Quebeckers; He only has the concern to heal his image. While Philippe Couillard tries to be the best friend of Ottawa, our patients are waiting and our elders suffer. Although Minister Gaétan Barrette maintains Quebec's traditional position on transfers, the Trudeau government is not worried, knowing that he can always count on the cooperation of Philippe Couillard, "said Nicolas Marceau. 
"The unilateral refusal of the federal government in the priority issue of health transfers demonstrates the limits of the powers of Quebec in Canada. The question that arises at the Liberal Party and the CAQ, it is: what do you propose to get out of this impasse? So far, the answer is nothing at all, "continued the spokesman. 
"If the Cutee government wants to make gains against Ottawa, it will have to learn to stand up, instead of looking for good agreement at all costs. Gaétan Barrette tried to harden the tone repeatedly, but it is clear that the Prime Minister refuses to support him fully. I invite Philippe Couillard to review his approach, to draw inspiration from the attitude of his Minister of Health in this particular file, "concluded Nicolas Marceau.
