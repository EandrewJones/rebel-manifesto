Québec- The member for Taillon and sentence of the official objection to health and accessibility to care, Diane Lamarre, and the member for Verchères and spokespersons in Canadian intergovernmental cases, Stéphane Bergeron, denounce Prime Minister Philippe Couillard's intention to consent without response to the future decline in federal health transfers. This acceptance represents billions of dollars less for Quebec's public finances. 
"The changes proposed by Ottawa for federal transfers mean the loss of more than $ 9 billion over 10 years for Quebec's finances. While the government makes budget cuts, moreover denounced by the health network, this decision is unacceptable. Philippe Couillard must be in the defense of Quebeckers on this issue. How would the government justify this shortage of 9 billion within the next 10 years? What services will no longer be rendered to patients, who already suffer from the shifting lack of access and who are exposed to announced cuts? Asked Diane Lamarre. 
Let us remember that Even Jean Charest, during a speech made before the Canadian Medical Association, had denounced Ottawa on this issue, replacing his lack of dialogue. In fact, since the federal decision has been known, since 2011, all premiers and finance ministers of Quebec have denounced this situation, except Philippe Couillard, which bonds it. 
"Prime Minister Couillard accepts what Mr. Charest has denounced. With the Ottawa decision, the share of the health costs assumed by the federal government will fall within 20%, compared to the 50% it originally represented. Should we understand that the resignation and refusal to ask will be the new way of doing things and the new policy of the Liberal government against the federal government? It's a decision that will cost Quebeckers. Where will Philippe Couillard go get this money remained in Ottawa? Will it increase taxes? Stéphane Bergeron added.
