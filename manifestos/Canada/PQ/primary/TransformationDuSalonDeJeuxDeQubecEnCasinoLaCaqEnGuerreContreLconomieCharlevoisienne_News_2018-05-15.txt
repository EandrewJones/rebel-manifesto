The member for Taschereau and the official opposition spokesman responsible for the Capitale-Nationale Region, Agnès Maltese, fiercely denounces the will of the Future Québec Coalition to transform the Quebec Casino playlist. 
IN SHORT 
"The CAQ proposes to transform the Quebec Play Fair in Casino; This very bad idea is a frontal attack towards the economic vitality of the Charlevoix region. There is already a casino in the Capitale-Nationale region, and it is in Charlevoix. In no case should it change. Charlevoix, it is an economy already weakened by the centralization of jobs in the public service operated by the Liberals. For the Parti Québécois, there is no question of opening a casino in Quebec City; Instead, we rely on the complementarity of the tourist offer, "said Agnès Maltais immediately. 
"The people of the Capitale-Nationale now know that the CAQ proposes to jeopardize the 250 good jobs in the Charlevoix casino. This proposal clearly demonstrates that it has no vision with respect to regions and economic development. Only for her, it's secondary, as for the Liberals. Charlevoix is an incredible tourist region that enjoys an enviable reputation, and its casino is one of its main tourist attractions. The opening of a casino in Quebec would be resolutely harmful to its economy and population, "concluded the hon. Member.
