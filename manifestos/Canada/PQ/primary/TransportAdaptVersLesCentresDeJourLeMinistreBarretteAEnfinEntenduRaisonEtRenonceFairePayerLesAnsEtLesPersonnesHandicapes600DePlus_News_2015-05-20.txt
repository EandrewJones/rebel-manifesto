Quebec- The member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, Jean-François Lisée, and the hon. Member for Richelieu and spokesperson for seniors, Sylvain Rochon, are satisfied that the Minister of Health And social services, Gaétan Barrette, accepted the request of the Parti Québécois to cancel the draconian rise in the cost of the adapted transportation service for seniors and persons with disabilities attending day centers. 
"For some people, the increases reached 600% and accounted for costs of $ 1,000 a year. The minister was a "adjustment?", It was an absolutely disproportionate and unjustifiable increase. For the vast majority of seniors and people with disabilities, $ 1,000 is simply overpriced. He n n. There was no other solution than to give up these totally unfair increases, "said Jean-François Lisée. 
"First the CHSLD, then the pricing of day centers: for the second time in as many weeks, the Minister Barrette is forced to give up higher tariffs affecting seniors. This is an excellent news, but we will nevertheless monitor the minister closely to ensure that he does respect his Prime Minister's commitment to not raise taxes and rates beyond inflation ". , added Sylvain Rochon. 
The member for Rosemont also pointed out that seniors and people with disabilities did not have to pay the government's obsession with a balanced budget. "The government has made the political choice to significantly increase the salary of doctors, and it must assume it. Quebec patients do not have to undergo a tariff shock to compensate for a shortfall caused by its mismanagement of public finances, "he concluded.
