"The choice of government is the lightweight rail system (SLR). The latter is part of this vision of the future of transport in the 21st century. The latter incarnates by the transportation of the electrification of the transport launched by the Prime Minister of Quebec, Ms. Pauline Marois. In addition, the SLR joins our environmental, urban planning and economic development guidelines. It helps meet the challenges posed by demographic growth and sustainable development. Powered by electricity, it is an ecological mode of transport that has the ability to meet current and future needs in this strategic axis already strongly solicited, "said Minister Gaudreault.
