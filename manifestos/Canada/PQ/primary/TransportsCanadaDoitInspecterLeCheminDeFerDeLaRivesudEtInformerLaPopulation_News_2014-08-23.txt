Quebec- The member for Vachon and the official opposition spokesman for transport, transport and maritime strategy, Martine Ouellet, and the member for Verchères and spokespersons in Canadian intergovernmental cases, Stéphane Bergeron, say very worried about the state of the railway borrowed, for a few weeks, by convoys carrying hazardous materials on the south shore of Montreal. 
Indeed, associations and mayors of the region argue that the railway of the South Shore is in a deplorable state. In addition, the media also taught us that three million liters of oil circulate every day on these rails for a month now. 
It is useful to remember that the operator of the railway in question, CN, is judge and part in the case since it is the sole responsible for inspections. Although CN tries to be reassuring, it is perfectly legitimate for the people of the region to worry about the situation and demand more information. 
"Citizens and elected officials are concerned with reason. Transport Canada must send inspectors to the premises. What explains this increase in oil circulation on the railway of the South Shore? Is this temporary or permanent? How long does CN work? Considering the poor status of rails and the increase in traffic, Transport Canada must inform citizens and elected measures that have been taken to ensure the safety of the people of the region, "said Martine Ouellet. 
"Transport Canada must be very vigilant in the transportation of hazardous materials, which has seen its work severely criticized, this week, in the report of the Transportation Security Bureau following the terrible tragedy of Lac-Mégantic. To hope to regain the confidence of Quebeckers, Transport Canada will have to be perfectly exemplary, which sometimes means doing much more than the basic rules prescribe, "add Stéphane Bergeron.
