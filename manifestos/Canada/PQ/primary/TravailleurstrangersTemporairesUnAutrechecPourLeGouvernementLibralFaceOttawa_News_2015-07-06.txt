Quebec- The member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, the member for Berthier and Spokesperson in Agriculture, André Villeneuve, and the member for Bourget and Door -Parole in immigration, Maka Kotto, find another failure from the Liberal government against Ottawa, while the Canadian Minister of Employment and Social Development, Pierre Poilievre, Ribbed Sam Hamad after it has mentioned An opening of the Federal on changes to the Temporary Foreign Workers Program. 
"It's a cooking failure for the Philippe Couillard government, which likes to imagine that the Canadian government listens to it. The Liberal Government wipes reverses against the federal on the federal and is not worried about the lack of consideration of Quebec's interests by Canada, "said Stéphane Bergeron. 
"The limits imposed by the Canadian government with foreign workers weaken the operations of several factories, particularly food processing, where recruitment difficulties make these workers essential. The majority of the jobs of these factories are occupied by Quebeckers, and they are likely to lose their jobs if companies do not succeed in maintaining their production at 100% of their capacity. The Canadian government tackles businesses that create jobs in Quebec, "continued André Villeneuve. 
"What will the Liberals do now, so that these workers can continue to contribute to the maintenance of the operations of these factories? An independent Quebec could itself establish the rules governing the hiring of temporary foreign workers and would not be at the mercy of the ideological postures of the Conservative government of Stephen Harper, "concluded Maka Kotto.
