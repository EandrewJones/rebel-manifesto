Quebec- You will find attached a joint statement this morning by the member for Champlain, Ms. Noëlta Champagne, and the member for Saint-Maurice, Mr. Luc Trudel, concerning the impossibility for deputy ministerial members to continue the work in the framework of the mandate to study the decommissioning of the Gentilly-2 nuclear power plant and the economic diversification plan for the sectors of the Center-du-Québec and Mauritius, during the Working Session of the Committee on Agriculture , fisheries and natural resources (Capern). 
Members of the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries, Energy and Natural Resources (CAPERN) 
"Whereas the parliamentary committee held on 29 and 30 January last on the study of the decommissioning impacts of the Gentilly-2 nuclear power plant and the economic diversification plan for the Center-du-Québec and Mauricie sectors allowed to the various stakeholders to express themselves freely; 
"Considering that sometimes sturdy exchanges have just allowed the Minister of Natural Resources and the Government of Quebec to understand the impacts of such decommissioning; 
Considering that a report written by parliamentarians of different political formations seems obviously dedicated to a deep misunderstanding; 
Considering that the February 20 working session, demonstrated beyond doubt the incompatibility of understanding on the Fund of Things; 
"Considering that aggressiveness and words shocked during this work session have undermined the smooth running of the meeting and put an end to the basic respect between parliamentarians; 
Considering that such an atmosphere is in no way conducive to the drafting of a report devoid of any partisanship; 
"The members of the Parliamentary Committee representing the Government can not continue under these conditions to discuss this report. 
"As a result, there is no consent to continue trade in order to file a report at the National Assembly beyond the date proposed in the mandate, on February 21, 2013.
