Qu√©bec- The member for Bonaventure and spokesman for the Quebecois on forest, wildlife and parks, Sylvain Roy, finds completely unacceptable that the Minister of Forests, Laurent Lessard, retains 25% of the budget announced by Prime Minister Philippe Couillard for the execution of non-commercial silvicultural work. 
"It's $ 151 million that should be spent directly on the ground. The Minister of Forests holds 25%; It means a cup of $ 38 million. He breaks a promise made by the Prime Minister in February 2015. The amounts selected were already planned by the Ministry of Finance to ensure predictability to entrepreneurs. But a few days from the beginning of the sylvicultural work season, the government denounces its commitment, "denounced the hon. Member for Bonaventure. 
"In addition to causing job losses in silvicultural businesses - who had planned the execution of the work according to the announced budgets -, the $ 38 million Cup will result in the waste of sums already invested in the planning in 2015 . Minister Lessard must immediately release these amounts, in order to ensure the smooth running of silvicultural work and not to compromise planning for the coming years, "concluded Sylvain Roy.
