Quebec- The spokesperson for the Quebec's transport, maritime strategy, transport and telecommunications electrification, Martine Ouellet, asks the new Minister of Transport, Jacques Daoust, to go further than his predecessor by doing Stop the activities of the UBERX illegal taxi service. 
"During his tenure, Robert PoÃ«ti has repeatedly told the UberX service was illegal. Minister Daoust must go further than words and stop illegal taxi activities. The tension rises in the industry, the drivers are in touch and the Cuteillard government abandoned them. In which other industry tolerates illegal activities made in broad daylight? Minister Daoust must do more than denounce; He must stop the Uberx service once and for all, to prevent the situation from degenerating, "said Martine Ouellet. 
Indeed, it is illogical that, on the one hand, the government requires taxi drivers they hold a permit worth several tens of thousands of dollars while, on the other hand, it tolerates that some people offer the same service without a license. This competition is not only unfair, it turns out to the laws. 
"It's not normal for workers to make legal approaches to enforce the laws of Quebec. The industry is modernizing at large V speed; Several taxi companies have developed technological platforms just as efficient as UberX. The problem is not technology, it is the illegal taxi activities. Worst, UberX encourages honest citizens to become illegal. The government must protect taxi drivers and their families, "concluded Martine Ouellet.
