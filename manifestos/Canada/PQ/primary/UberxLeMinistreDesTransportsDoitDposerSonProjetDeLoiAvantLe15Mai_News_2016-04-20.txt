Québec - For several weeks, the member for Vachon and spokesman for the Quebec's transportation party, Martine Ouellet, press the Minister of Transport, Jacques Daoust, to introduce a bill to supervise the services of UberX. Today in the House, she claimed he's acting here on May 15, deadline to pass a bill before the end of this parliamentary session. So far, however, the minister refused to commit to that effect. 
"In the field, the situation deteriorates. Every day without a bill allows UberX to continue its illegal activities. The minister had enough time. He must file his bill to prohibit the illegal taxi no later than May 15th. This is a matter of justice and fairness: all taxi services must be subject to the same rules. Why would there be a particular diet for Uberx, and another for taxis? The minister has no excuse; As his predecessor, Jacques Daoust repeated several times that he intended to file a bill. Why wait? Asked Martine Ouellet. 
"It's been two years since the file is studied. We have fully worked on the management of the taxi industry and the Parti Québécois has even proposed a bill to counter the illegal taxi. Already two consultations were conducted: one in the summer of 2014, and another Spring. Minister Jacques Daoust has all the information he can dream. He also repeated that he was doing everything to file on time, but he refuses to talk about May 15th. He must, however, act, and quickly, "concluded the member of the Parti Québécois.
