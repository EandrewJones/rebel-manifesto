Québec- Reacting to the interference revelations of Minister Pierre Moreau in the appointment process at the Independent Investigations Office (EIB), the spokesman for the Parti Québécois on public safety, Pascal Bérubé, briefly denounces the attitude of the Minister, which blocks the appointment of independent candidates, guarantors of parity between police and civilians within the EIB. 
"The Liberals pervert the very nature of the Office of Independent Investigations, which was to be based on a parity between police and civilians. This parity is essential to the credibility of EIB as a truly independent organism. Why does Pierre Moreau block appointments? "Asked Pascal Bérubé. 
According to the law creating the EIB, adopted by the Government of the Parti Québécois, "the investigators are appointed on the recommendation of the Director of the Bureau", and it "promotes parity between investigators who have never been peace officers and those. who have already been ". 
"Minister Moreau has no reasonable reason to block the recommendations of the EIB Director. He must explain why he opposes the appointment of independent investigators at the Independent Investigations Office. In the interest of who does he act so? It is certainly not in that of Quebeckers, "pursued Mr. Bérubé. 
Recall that last week, Pierre Moreau, at the dawn of an announced ministerial reshuffle, took advantage of the absence of his prime minister to propose the creation of a tailor-made department for him, bringing together public safety and the Municipal Affairs. 
"Weekly on the week, we discover that instead of working for Quebeckers, Pierre Moreau works first and foremost for Pierre Moreau," concluded the member for Matane-Matapédia.
