Dolbeau-Mistassini- The Prime Minister of Quebec, Pauline Marois, accompanied by the Minister of Natural Resources, Martine Ouellet, and the Parliamentary Assistant for Forests, Denis Trottier, announced an investment of 8.5 m $ for the realization of silvicultural projects and to harvest the woods affected by insects or the forest fires of the summer of 2013. 
"This support for sylvicole employment across Quebec is made possible by adding an envelope of $ 5 million and reallocating $ 3.5 million for priority sylvicultural projects at this autumn. This investment will carry out non-commercial silvicultural work, partial sections, especially in the leafy forest, and specially damaged wood recovery plans in the summer of 2013 by insects or forest fires. In addition, given the late date for the realization of several works, undecided budgets can be postponed to next season, "said the Prime Minister. 
"The forestry sector is one of Quebec's leading economic engines. It is all the more for a resource region like ours. The announcement we do today will result in an additional investment of more than $ 2.2 million at us, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, "said the member for Roberval, Denis Trottier. 
"Forestry will be at the heart of the discussions of the next appointment of the Quebec Forest. Our forest offers very interesting prospects for economic development that will benefit all Quebeckers. It is together that we can find ways of solution to maximize the forest territories we have chosen to develop in respect of the environment, and create wealth for Quebec and all its regions, "concluded the Minister Martine Ouellet.
