Quebec-Carole Poirier, MP D'Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesman for the Parti Québécois in terms of women's condition, is very proud of the adoption of an amendment to Bill No.83, An Act to amend various municipal legislation concerning including political financing. It will allow any elected municipal to be absent from the Council meetings for a maximum period of 18 consecutive weeks, if this absence is attributable to its pregnancy, birth or adoption of its child, without that his mandate ends. 
The hon. Member recalls that it was one of the commitments made by the Quebecois party at the Summit of Women last March. "I want to emphasize the determination of several municipal elected municipal fought to change the mentalities," she said. 
Carole Poirier also welcomes the collaboration of the Minister responsible for the Status of Women and the Minister of Municipal Affairs for the adoption of this legislative amendment. "I am pleased that the text of Bill 594, which I presented last February, has been adopted in full. Women will be able to take their place in politics more. In this area, the issue of work-family conciliation is particularly sensitive. However, it is fundamental to the achievement of equality between men and women, "she added. 
"The achievement of true equality between women and men is a project of society that requires work, openness, respect, sometimes of audacity, and certainly of constancy and vigilance. Certainly, the future of Quebec, our collective future as a nation, must necessarily go through. We will continue, as a parliamentary group and as a political training, to engage in this direction, "continued Carole Poirier. 
Finally, the spokesperson invites the government to draw inspiration from the other proposals of the Quebecois party that aim at achieving a real gender parity in politics. "It's time to dust off the rules governing the lives of elected officials," she concluded.
