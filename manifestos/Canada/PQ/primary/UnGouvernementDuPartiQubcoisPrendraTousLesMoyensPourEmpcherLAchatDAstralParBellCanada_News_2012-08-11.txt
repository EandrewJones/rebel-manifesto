Montréal - The Parti Québécois candidate in the riding of Bourget, Maka Kotto, is committed to that the Quebec party takes all the means available to block the purchase of Astral by Bell Canada. "We will carry out a battle of all the moments who could go to an appeal to the courts or the filing of legislation aimed at preventing such control over our means of diffusion by Toronto," he said . 
"For decades, all the governments of Quebec have struggled for our nation to have the control of its cultural levers and dissemination channels. Under Robert Bourassa, the ministers of culture fought for Quebec to control its telecommunications. It is indeed essential for a nation to control the diffusion channels of its own culture, "he added. 
For Maka Kotto, there must be an alliance among all political parties on this issue. The silence of the Liberal government is unacceptable. "The Government of Jean Charest defends only the lips which is still essential for our future. Quebec is currently placed in front of a serious threat. The purchase of Astral would make Bell Canada a dominant player in telecommunications and in the broadcast of content. If this project is concretized, Quebec will lose a new head office, it will lose control of a large part of the diffusion channels of its culture, which will be in the hands of a giant led from Toronto. Do we really want fundamental decisions about our culture to Toronto without regard to the interests and values of Quebec? For the Parti Québécois, the answer is no! » 
Maka Kotto asks François Legault to remove any ambiguity concerning the position of the CAQ. "The one he presents like his future Minister of Culture, Claire Samson, signed and filed two days ago a brief before the CRTC that approves the purchase of astral by Bell. François Legault opposes the purchase of astral by Bell while his candidate assumes the transaction. What is the exact position of the CAQ? He asked. 
In closing, Maka Kotto pointed out that a government of the Quebecois party will open negotiations with Ottawa to repatriate powers and budgets in culture and telecommunications. Other political courses have a duty to decide on this fundamental issue for the cultural future of our nation.
