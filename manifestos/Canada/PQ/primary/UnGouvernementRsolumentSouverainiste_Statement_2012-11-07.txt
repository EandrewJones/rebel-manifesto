As you know, we form a sovereignist government. We consider that Quebec has everything to gain to become a country. It is true in legal matters, where our belonging to the Canadian whole comes with the imposition of a constitution ever signed by Quebec. This limits our ability to define our linguistic laws, the regulatory regime of our telecommunications, our citizenship or our criminal laws. 
Quebec has everything to gain to master all taxes and taxes. For example, think of the billions of dollars of our taxes that helped the auto industry in Ontario or the Maritime projects in Nova Scotia, while our wood industry and our manufacturing sector are left behind by Ottawa. . 
Think of substantial savings that sovereignty will allow us to do in bureaucratic expenses by eliminating all administrative duplicates. Quebec gains nothing to fund two ministries of transport, the environment, finance, two income agencies, two Treasury Boards or even two parliaments and a Senate. 
Let's think of our priorities as a nation. What do we want to do with our taxes: finance the celebration of the war of 1812 and royalty or finance our culture and our education? 
Quebec has everything to gain to talk about its own voice in the world, to be present in international forums where our future is emerging and implementing its own foreign policy, according to our interests and values. 
In short, the members of the government and I will continue to promote this idea that the only future worthy of the name for the Quebec nation is to regain its freedom by founding a new country. A country that looks like us: a country for all!
