Quebec - Minister Delegate to Aboriginal Affairs, Mrs. Elizabeth Larouche, took part today at the Canonization Ceremony of Kateri Tekakwitha, First Amerindian to access the rank of Holy. 
Ms. Larouche said very moved after the ceremony: "I had the chance to live a moment not only historic, but also charged with emotions," said the minister. 
In the company of several dignitaries as well as thousands of pilgrims from Quebec and elsewhere in the world, Ms. Larouche was able to attend this event expected by many Catholic Aboriginal people who do a great admiration to the New Holy. 
Born in the United States, Kateri Tekakwitha (1656-1680) lived part of his life in New France. His tomb is exposed to Kahnawake. 
"Sainte Kateri Tekakwitha all affects us in a way. The recognition that she received today allowed us to gather around a common reference, "said Ms. Larouche. 
During his stay in Rome, Ms. Larouche met with the Grand Chief of the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake, Michael Delisle, as well as leaders and other representatives of the First Nations. After the canonization ceremony, the minister benefited from a brief interview with Pope Benedict XVI.
