The reconstruction of the Turcot exchanger will be the largest road site ever undertaken in Quebec. Today's announcement was therefore decisive, not only for the future of the metropolis, but also for all Quebec, since it is about the interconnection between the main axes that make Montreal the hub of the Road transport in Quebec. 
Thanks to the bonuses announced this morning, a larger place will be made to collective transport and will ensure better integrating the structure with the urban framework. In addition, we will have the room for maneuver needed to consider different electrically collective transport options. 
I also want to clarify that Turcot's reconstruction will be the first major work done in accordance with the provisions of the new Public Contract Integrity Act, adopted last December. There will be no right-law, which is certainly not the least of the improvements we bring ... 
More room for collective transport, better urban integration, transparent mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the site: it is in this way that the new government prints its brand on Turcot. 
This is a necessary project that we will lead with a responsible approach, which gives our sustainable development concerns greaterly. A vital project for Montreal, essential for all Quebec. 
Above all, it's a project that has already trained too much. Finally, we go ahead.
