Quebec- The Prime Minister and Minister responsible for Youth Records, Pauline Marois, is proud to announce the financial support of the Government of Quebec to the agency for respect for diversity. An amount of $ 25,000 financed by the Youth Secretariat will thus be devoted to the project the caravans of tolerance 15-17. 
The organization's mission is to make young people aware of the respect of the differences and to invite them to take part in the dialogue to build an environment free of discrimination and intimidation. The caravans of tolerance 15-17 are an interactive workshop that offers 3rd, 4th century young people a critical reflection on discrimination, prejudices and stereotypes depending on the form they take and the consequences they can lead. Starting from the point of view and experience of young people, two expert animators in this area create a space for dialogue where students can explore common prejudices and their origins. A discussion begins to understand how preconceived ideas sometimes reflect in acts of discrimination and how, in return, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms of the person can allow us to assert our rights. 
"We are proud to contribute to this project aimed at curing intimidation among young people. This funding will allow the organization to pursue its objectives and more conscientizing young people with the inherent dangers of discrimination in all its forms, "said Pauline Marois. 
Each year, ten regions of Quebec are approached by the caravans of tolerance 17. Since 2010, nearly 30,000 young people have been able to learn about the issues related to different forms of discrimination. This project will contribute to the implementation of the Challenge of the 2009-2014 Youth Lastracy Diversity.
