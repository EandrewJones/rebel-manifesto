Quebec- Today during the question period, the member for Saint-Jérôme and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, asked Prime Minister Philippe Couillard to stop cutting in the services to students because these cuts. are not justified. 
"A lost year, for young people in difficulty, it's a year lost forever; The damage is irreparable. The Prime Minister must recover and straighten the situation as it is still time, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
The Leader of the Official Opposition recalled the words of Michel Perron, a Quebec summit in the field of school perseverance, who fears that young people who give up the school are more numerous because of the compressions imposed by the government. 
"Today, it is learned that the notes of students in difficulty, at the Laval School Board, would be swollen because we have generalized the use of bulletins with lowered requirements. So, as if by magic, the success rate increases, justifying the removal of 12 specialized classes, as the government orders it. Does the Prime Minister approve the use of this leveling stratagem at the bottom to legitimize the blind cuts of his minister of education? Asked Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
The Leader of the Official Opposition also denounced the cuts made in student services. "In Mauricie, the government puts an end to the respite-transit program, which helped students deal with behavioral disorders; Six education professionals go to the hatch. A school adaptation expert, Aegis Royer, goes so far as to compare the situation three years of interruption of vaccination campaigns. Why cut into the services offered to the most vulnerable? , "He concluded.
