"We are pleased to note that Quebec solidarity members have chosen to maintain their involvement in United States independence organizations, yes Quebec, a place to discuss and work that brings together all independence forces. The work we have started together last winter are promising and we are looking forward to pursuing them. On the other hand, the opening that it demonstrated by QS by setting up a large project on the possibility of convergence and alliances, including the idea of ​​common candidatures, constitutes a gesture of great importance for the to come up. This response favorable to the invitation launched by Jean-François Lisée and by many progressives demonstrates that, little by little, we move forward in a carrier direction. In respect of our differences, more and more Quebeckers meet behind the goal of dislodging the most toxic Liberal government in our history, "said the member. 
The Parti Québécois reiterates its willingness to work on the reform of the voting system and to discuss the issues that appear priority in Quebec Solidarity. The points of convergence between the program that the Parti Québécois is developing and the ideas borne by Quebec Solidaire, as well as social movements, will allow us to have a constructive discussion in the months that separate us from the election of 2018. 
"Every rapprochement gesture is a significant gesture towards convergence, from the most modest to the most ambitious. In itself, it is representative of a real commitment of commitment, while learning to work together, "Concluded Véronique Hivon.
