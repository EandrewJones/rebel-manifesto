Québec - About a hundred people participated yesterday at the Colloquium on the mobility of people who had been organized by the Capitale-National Party. The goal of this free, non-partisan event was to share knowledge on transportation issues and initiate a fact-based citizen discussion. 
The symposium resulted in very rich exchanges and allowed the expression of divergent or even contradictory points of view. Two consensus are nevertheless appeared very clearly: 
"The debates about transport have been very emotional in recent months. It's ok, but it can not suffice, recalled the regional president of the Quebecois Party, Mr. Clement Laberge. It should also be ensured that the debates are based on quality information. Everyone can then forge a more enlightened opinion. I am glad that the Parti Québécois has been able to contribute to this goal by organizing this event. " 
"We must not forget that collective transport is an indispensable element for the development of a region. It is an important source of collective enrichment. It is necessary to choose according to the long term, by not losing sight of a transport system must be thought of 50 to 100 years, summarized Agnès Maltais. "
