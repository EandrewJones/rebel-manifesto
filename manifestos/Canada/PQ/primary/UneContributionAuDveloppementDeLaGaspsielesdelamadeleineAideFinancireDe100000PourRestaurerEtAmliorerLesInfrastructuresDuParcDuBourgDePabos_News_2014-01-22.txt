Chandler- The Minister Delegate to the Regions, Minister responsible for the Gaspé-Îles-de-la-Madeleine Region and Member of the Gaspé Constituency, Mr. Gaétan Lelèvre, accompanied by the hon. Member for Bonaventure and Deputy Parliamentary Deputy Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks (Fauna and Parks), Mr. Sylvain Roy, announce $ 100,000 financial assistance to restore and improve camping infrastructure in Pabos Bourg Park. Financial assistance comes from the Regional Initiatives Assistance Fund (FAIR). 
Since the installation of a pedestrian gateway by the city of Chandler, the park of the village of Pabos has seen its traffic increase. Indeed, the rental of sites on the campground has more than doubled between 2006 and 2012 to 3870 nights. In order to consolidate the recreational supply of the park, camping facilities must be restored, including the expansion of playgrounds, the development of a children's recreation and the restoration of parking and resting areas. 
"I look forward to the announcement today of this contribution that will support the recreational offer of the Pabos Bourg Park. This beautiful initiative will help stimulate the development of the RCM of the Percé rock, "said the minister. 
The Regional Initiatives Fund aims to support the Government Intervention Strategy for the Development of the Gaspé-Islands-de-la-Madeleine Region and constitutes a major lever to promote, in particular, the implementation of projects from the development priorities of the region. An annual $ 6 million annual envelope is scheduled for this fund, for a period of five years. The program is in effect until March 31, 2018.
