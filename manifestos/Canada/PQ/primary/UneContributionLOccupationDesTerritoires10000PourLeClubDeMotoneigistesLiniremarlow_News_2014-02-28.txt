Saint-Theophile- The Minister of Labor, Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister responsible for the Status of Women and Minister responsible for the Capitale-Nationale and Chaudière-Appalaches, Ms. Agnès Maltais, on behalf of the Minister Municipal affairs, regions and occupation of the territory and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announces $ 10,000 financial assistance to the Linière-Marlow Motoneigist Club for its expansion project. This amount comes from the Cyprusural Development Fund (FCD). 
The enlargement of the building provided by the club will allow it to develop a new locker room for snowmobile with more storage space and install a new access ramp for people with disabilities. In addition, the club will have to redo the roof for the part of the enlargement, move the kitchen and retouch the rest and meal areas. It will also change the floor covering and redo the paint as a result of the work. 
"The Liniere-Marlow Motoneigist Club is the only snowmobile front door for American tourists and that justifies this financial assistance. The work will ensure the durability of the club by enhancing the quality and reception of tourists at the border crossing, "said Minister Maltese. 
It should be noted that the FCD aims to support initiatives that contribute in particular to the economic, social, cultural, tourist, environmental and technological development and that could not be achieved without its contribution.
