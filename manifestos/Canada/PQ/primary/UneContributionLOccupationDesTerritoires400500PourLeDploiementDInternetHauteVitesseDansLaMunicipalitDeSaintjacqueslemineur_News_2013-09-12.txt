Member of the District of Gaspé, Mr. Gaétan Lelièvre, announces the granting of aid $ 400,500 in the municipality of Saint-Jacques-le-Minor to support the deployment of a high-speed Internet (IHV) on its territory as part of the Rural Communities Unit. 
"It is with pride that I announce this important contribution from the Government of Quebec, which will stimulate the economic, social and cultural growth of the municipality while strengthening its attraction. In the long term, the realization of this project will allow citizens to connect to the world, "said Minister Lelièvre. 
The project is to put in place IHV telecommunication infrastructures in areas not yet covered to increase the coverage rate of this territory. The financing of this project, estimated at more than $ 1 million, will be completed by Déry Telecom, which will remain the owner of the deployed telecommunications infrastructures. 
"Our government reiterates its willingness to offer all citizens and citizens of Quebec a high-speed Internet connection so that they can rely on this indispensable tool in today's world, where knowledge and Information and communications technologies play an increasingly strategic role in the socio-economic development of rural territories, "said the minister. 
Coming from the National Rural Policy 2007-2014, the Rural Communities Program are aimed at supporting environmental projects to provide rural communities with a similar and cost-comparable IHV service to that offered in urban areas.
