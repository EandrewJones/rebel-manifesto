Baie-James- The member for Ungava and Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Natural Resources (Nordic Affairs Component), Mr. Luc Ferland, on behalf of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and the Occupation of the Territory and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announces the granting of $ 60,000 financial assistance to Agla Media to support the production and dissemination of the James Focus Baie-James project. 
More concretely, this amount will be used to finance the production of a documentary series on James Bay. This project, which will present the odyssey of two photographers on the roads of this vast country, will highlight the cultural, natural and historical wealth of this unknown region of Quebeckers. 
"It is with great pride that the Government of Quebec contributes to the realization of this project that will shine the James Bay through Quebec while allowing Jamesians to see their region under a new eye and discover still unknown facets. It's a brand new image of James Bay that will be presented, a unique and positive image, "said Mr. Ferland. 
Financial assistance comes from the Cyclical Development Fund of the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, Regions and the Occupation of the Territory.
