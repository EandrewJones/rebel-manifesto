MONT-JOLI - Minister Delegate to Tourism, Minister responsible for the Bas-Saint-Laurent Region and MFA Region, Mr. Pascal Bérubé, on behalf of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and the Occupation of the Territory and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announces the granting of $ 124,546 funding to the MRC of Mitis to ensure the fire safety protection of the residents of the parishes of Sainte-Jeanne-d'Arc and redemption. 
The financial assistance granted will allow the MRC of the Mitis to increase its strike force by acquiring a new tanker with a capacity of 10,000 liters for the Redemption Fire Safety Department. Remember that the tanker truck that was until now used had to be decommissioned due to major defects. This acquisition is therefore necessary to ensure adequate protection of the territory, particularly in areas that are not served by the aqueduct network. This project, which requires investments of $ 249,093, complies with the RCM Fire Safety Risk Coverage Scheme. 
"Our government is committed to the future of the regions and people who live there, and that is why we have made the dynamic occupation of the territories a priority. By ensuring the safety of the parishes of Sainte-Jeanne-d'Arc and Redemption, we reiterate our desire to support rural municipalities and provide essential services to all Quebeckers, "said Minister Bérubé. 
Financial assistance comes from the support of support for the territories in difficulty investigating the governmental plan of action for municipalities. This fund includes five components, aimed at funding the purchase of equipment for municipalities to comply with government standards, including environmental and fire safety.
