Chibougamau- The hon. Member for Ungava, Mr. Luc Ferland, on behalf of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and the Occupation of the Territory and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announces $ 104,231 a financial assistance to the City of Chibougamau for the creation of an intercultural urban park at the entrance of the Obaski Regional Park in Chibougamau. This amount comes from the Cyprusural Development Fund (FCD). 
This new park will be installed on the edge of Lake Gilman near the city center of Chibougamau. It will become an attractive and stimulating meeting place for the population of the region as well as for tourists. Indeed, the development of the site will include earthmoving work, the development of a green space serving as a gathering area and the construction of a pergola for the holding of Aboriginal shows and celebrations. In addition, the construction of a home, the creation and setting up of interpretation panels, the addition of lighting and the construction of a wooden sidewalk leading to the dock are provided for in the project. To do this, we plan to withdraw the current wharf structure and reconstruction, develop two aquatic platforms and carry out landscaping work. The total project cost is estimated at over $ 250,000. 
"The support of our government to this project testifies, once again, our commitment to ensuring the dynamism and vitality of municipalities taking into account their reality. In the long term, the population will benefit from a gathering place that will promote the meeting and understanding between the Cree and Jamesian communities of Chibougamau and the surrounding area, "said the member Ferland. 
It should be noted that the FCD aims to support initiatives that contribute in particular to the economic, social, cultural, tourist, environmental and technological development and that could not be achieved without its contribution.
