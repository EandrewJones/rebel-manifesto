Saint-Leon-le-Grand- The member for Saint-Maurice, Mr. Luc Trudel, on behalf of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and the Occupation of the Territory and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announces financial assistance from $ 141,850 in the municipality of Saint-Leon-le-Grand to relocate, in one place, all municipal services, community organizations and administrative offices. This amount comes from the Cyprusural Development Fund (FCD). 
The administrative offices of the municipality of Saint-Léon-le-Grand are located, since 1992, in the premises of the Primary School Saint-Léon which is owned by the school board of Chemin-du-Roy. In recent years, the municipality has experienced an increase in its population. More municipal employees are therefore required to meet the growing needs of citizens. As a result, the rented space to the school board no longer meets the needs of the municipality and citizens. In addition, the premises of the municipality are located on the second floor and are inaccessible for people with reduced mobility. Some citizens can therefore participate in the public sessions of the Council and must seek the help of a loved one to access certain services. 
"The support of our government to this unifying project testifies, once again, our commitment to ensuring the dynamism and vitality of municipalities taking into account their realities. Ultimately, the citizens of Saint-Léon-le-Grand will be able to benefit from a nervical place, which will truly meet their needs and that will actively participate in the development of their community, "said the member Trudel. 
It should be noted that the FCD aims to support initiatives that contribute in particular to the economic, social, cultural, tourist, environmental and technological development and that could not be achieved without its contribution.
