Quebec- As it was agreed with the family, Mr. Richard Garneau's funeral will be the subject of a national commemoration ceremony. The flag of the Central Tower of the Hotel du Parliament du Qu√©bec will be blown on the same day. The Protocol of the Government of Quebec will provide support for the organization of the ceremony. 
Funeral will be celebrated on Saturday, February 16 at 2 pm, at the Symphony House of Montreal.

In order to respect the intimacy of Mr. Garneau's family, no media representative will have access to the place of the ceremony and no media interview on the part of the family will not be granted. For this purpose, and by deference to the family, we rely on the entire collaboration of the press companies.
