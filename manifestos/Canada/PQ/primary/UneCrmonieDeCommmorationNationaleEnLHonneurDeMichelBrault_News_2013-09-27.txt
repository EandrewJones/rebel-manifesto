Qu√©bec- The Quebec government agreed with the family that the funeral of Michel Brault would take the form of a national commemoration ceremony in its memory. 
Born in 1928 in Montreal, Michel Brault is one of the largest filmmakers that Quebec has known. More than thirty films and documentaries carries its mark as a director, director of photography, producer or editor. His works have traveled the world and allowed to open the path to international recognition enjoyed by Quebec cinema. Pioneer of direct cinema, Michel Brault's gaze has evolved the 7th art to bring it closer to reality and give it a new sensitivity. 
The ceremony will be held on Friday, October 4 at 4 pm, at the Saint-Mathieu Church of Beloeil. 
The flag of the hotel's central tour of Parliament will be blown on the same day. The Protocol of the Government of Quebec will provide family support for the organization of the ceremony. 
In order to respect the intimacy of Mr. Brault's relatives, no media representative will have access to the place of the ceremony and no media interview on their share will be granted. For this purpose, and by deference to the family, we rely on the entire collaboration of the press companies.
