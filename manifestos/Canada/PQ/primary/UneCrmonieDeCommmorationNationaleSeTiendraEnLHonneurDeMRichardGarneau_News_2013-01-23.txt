Québec- As it has been agreed with the family, the funeral of Mr. Richard Garneau will be the subject of a national commemoration ceremony. 
Born in Quebec City in 1930, Mr. Richard Garneau was one of the brightest sports commentators of his time. It served as a model for generations that inspired it. His long career was marked by his eloquence, his professionalism and passion with which he described the sports exploits of our athletes. In addition, Mr. Garneau will have been a great ambassador of Quebec; It is indeed with a lot of class and dignity that he has represented us at national and international sporting events. 
The very day of the national commemoration ceremony, the flag of the Central Tower of the Hotel du Parliament du Québec will be born. In addition, the government's protocol will advise the family during the organization of the funeral ceremony. 
Details regarding Mr. Garneau's funeral will be known later.
