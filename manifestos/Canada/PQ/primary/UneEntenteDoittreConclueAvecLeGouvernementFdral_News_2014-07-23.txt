Quebec, July 23, 2014 - The member for Rosemont and official opposition on social services, Jean-François Lisé, "the Minister delegated to Rehabilitation, the Protection of Youth and Public Health Lucie Charlebois, so that an agreement is concluded quickly with the federal government for the renewal of the roaming partnership strategy (SPLI). 
"Money sleeps in Ottawa as the needs are shy in Montreal, as everywhere in Quebec. Where is the supposed collaboration between the Liberals and the federal government? I join my voice with that of homelessness organizations so that the SPLI is renewed, following the Quebec approach in this area, which includes housing priority in a broader and more flexible range of interventions, "said Jean-François Lisée. 
Many developing projects are still waiting for the federal government's money, which will want to redirect the remaining 3.2 million to a single program. This approach is contrary to the guidelines and ways of doing Quebec. 
Moreover, on April 30, 2013, the National Assembly unanimously adopted a motion requesting that the SPLI be renewed under the same conditions. It also denounced the federal intention to "unilaterally modify the strategy of homelessness partnerships to support the only" housing first "approach, which would result in a serious consequence of depriving funding for many and important projects. Racing roaming that meets a variety of needs and realities ". 
"I ask the Liberal Party to be consistent and respect the desire of all the elected officials of the National Assembly. The homelessness must already deal with the deferral, by the Liberals, of the approach to the control of homelessness and the plan of action which was to follow. I invite Minister Charlebois to act quickly on this issue, "concluded the member for Rosemont.
