Yesterday, in the pages of the daily duty, the President of the Immigration and Refugee Board defended the discuit of the Appeal Section of Refugees not to make public all of its judgments under the pretext that translation is too expensive. 
As the Official Languages Act imposes the translation of the decisions made by the courts, the Canadian government has chosen to circumvent the law. He will now decide which decisions will be made accessible to immigration lawyers as well as refugees, an eminently legal guidance guidance probably, but especially in terms of respect for Francophone Quebec. 
In addition, this decision shows that the Government of Canada has only one language of use, English, and that French is the language of a minority that can be "accommodating" occasionally , when it does not cost too much. As long as the federal government does not respect the common language of Quebec, we will oppose such decisions. 
I contacted last Thursday the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Canada, Mr. Chris Alexander, to exchange with him on this issue. I am always waiting for a return of appeal. 
I dare to believe that Quebec has a voice in the case of respect for its common language and that the federal minister also believes.
