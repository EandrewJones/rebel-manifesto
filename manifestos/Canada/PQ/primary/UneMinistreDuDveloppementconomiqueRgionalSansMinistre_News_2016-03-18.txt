Quebec- The Quebec Party spokesman for the development of the regions, Gaétan Lelièvre, the member for Rimouski, Harold Lebel, and the hon. Member for Bonaventure, Sylvain Roy, arrested the minister responsible for regional economic development this morning. Lise Thériault, in order to question her vision of the development of the regions of Quebec. 
"Minister Thériault has unfortunately demonstrated this morning his lack of knowledge of regional development, which confirms our fears that no one, within that government, knows or defends the regions. We questioned the minister on his projects, his programs, his vision for our regions, and we did not get any response. The minister has not even been able to specify, in the appropriations and budget plan 2016-2017, the amounts available to perform his task. Today, we had the confirmation that his post of minister responsible for regional economic development is an empty shell, "said Gaétan Lelièvre. 
"The liberal government's compressions deprived Quebec's regions of their development tools. More than $ 180 million were formerly dedicated to regional development, using devitalized territories, rural agents, etc. Last year, the envelope was cut by 60% and we learned yesterday in the 2016-2017 budget that this cup was now permanent, "said Sylvain Roy. 
"The Quebec Institute of Statistics has recently published alarming data about the demographics of our regions. All resource regions have seen its population decrease over the past year. It is not surprising when we have a government that continues to demonstrate its lack of knowledge of the regions. We had the proof this morning, a minister without department, without a portfolio, without a program and without vision will not be able to settle anything in the regions', concluded Harold Lebel.
