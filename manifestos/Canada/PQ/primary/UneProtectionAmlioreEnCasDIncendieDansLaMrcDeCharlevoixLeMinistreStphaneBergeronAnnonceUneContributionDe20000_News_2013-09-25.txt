Quebec- The Minister of Public Safety, Stéphane Bergeron, announces a contribution of $ 20,000 to the MRC de Charlevoix. This financial assistance is granted to it for the implementation of its fire safety hedging scheme. 
This sum complements the total contribution of $ 120,000 to which the RCM is entitled under the Financial Assistance Program to the MRC and other regional authorities for the establishment and implementation of risk coverage schemes. This financial assistance will allow the MRC to cover, in part, certain expenses related to the realization of regional scope activities. 
The Prime Minister and Deputy of Charlevoix-Côte-de-Beaupré, Ms. Pauline Marois, welcomed this announcement. "This is an important step in fire safety that has been crossed by the MRC de Charlevoix. Thanks to this rigorous planning, citizens of the region will benefit from better protection, "said the premier. 
"The efforts devoted by all stakeholders in the implementation of the Fire Safety Risk Coverage Schedule of Charlevoix must be underlined. This consultation of the municipalities and the Ministry of Public Security required several years of work and will ensure a safer environment to Quebeckers and Quebeckers, "said Minister Bergeron. 
Risk coverage schemes are aimed at increasing the knowledge of fire risks present in a territory. Thus, they not only improve services to citizens while optimizing resources, but also to provide more efficient coverage of territories in the event of fire and facilitate the work of stakeholders. It is therefore a must-see action for the 103 regional authorities and the municipalities of Quebec.
