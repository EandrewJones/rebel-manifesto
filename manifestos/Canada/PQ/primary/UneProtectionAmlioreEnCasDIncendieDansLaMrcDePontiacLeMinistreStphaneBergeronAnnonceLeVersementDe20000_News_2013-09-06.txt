Quebec- The Minister of Public Safety and Minister responsible for the Outaouais Region, St√©phane Bergeron, announces the payment of $ 20,000 to the MRC de Pontiac. This financial assistance is granted for the implementation of its fire safety risk cover scheme. 
"The efforts devoted by all stakeholders in the implementation of the Pontiac Fire Safety Risk Coverage Scheme must be underlined. This consultation of the municipalities and the Ministry of Public Security required several years of work and will ensure a safer environment to Quebeckers and Quebeckers, "said Minister Bergeron. 
This sum complements the total contribution of $ 120,000 to which the RCM is entitled under the Financial Assistance Program to the MRC and other regional authorities for the establishment and implementation of risk coverage schemes. This financial assistance will allow the MRC to cover, in part, certain expenses related to the realization of regional scope activities. 
"An important step in fire safety has been crossed by the MRC of Pontiac. Thanks to this rigorous planning, the citizens of the region will certainly benefit from better fire protection, "concluded Mr. Bergeron. 
Risk coverage schemes are aimed at increasing the knowledge of fire risks present in a territory. Thus, they not only improve services to citizens while optimizing resources, but also to provide more efficient coverage of territories in the event of fire and facilitate the work of stakeholders. It is therefore a must-see action for the 103 regional authorities and the municipalities of Quebec.
