G Aspon - Minister Delegate to the Regions, Minister responsible for the Gaspé-Islands-de-la-Madeleine Region and MP Gaétan Lelièvre, on behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr. François Gendron, announces the payment of $ 500,000 to the City of Gaspé by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Supporting the Municipalization Process of the Industrial Park river-au-fishing fishing, owned by department. 
This amount corresponds to the annual allowances planned between 2003 and 2012 for the maintenance and management of the field and the infrastructures of the industrial park. Its payment aims to facilitate the transfer of the industrial park to the city of Gaspé. 
The municipalization is a demanding exercise punctuated many stages, particularly with respect to transfers of different property titles, which have various legal aspects. "We are confident that the commitment we have made to the city to upgrade the infrastructure over the next five years will allow us to complete the process very soon," said Gendron. 
Recall that the park, located on the territory of the city of Gaspé, is the property of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. For more than 20 years, the department has entrusts management to the city of Gaspé, which has shown in recent years its interest to acquire it. 
"I am particularly proud of the recent developments in the negotiations in this issue. This is a great news for the Rivière-Au-Renard industry that can benefit from the upgrading of the services offered in the industrial park, "said Minister Lelièvre. 
"We are pleased that the Quebec government respects its commitments by giving us the amounts planned since 2003 for the management of the Rivière-Au-Renard Industrial Park. For us, it is a concrete gesture to resume discussions with a view to a possible transfer of ownership of the Mapaq Industrial Park to the city of Gaspé, "mentions the Mayor of Gaspé, Daniel Côté.
