As this political season ends, I am proud to say: The Parti Québécois team is running out, it's acting and brings results for Quebeckers. 
We are acting first to strengthen our economy. We want to create quality jobs in all regions of Quebec. That's why we introduced economic priority employment. 
Already, our efforts give results. There have never been as many Quebeckers as today, with 4,056,500 jobs, a level never reached. Quebec of 2013 has 50,000 more jobs. Of the number, 41,200 are full-time jobs. 
For just over a year, Quebeckers have again rely on a government that is acting on social justice. And, in fact, we see the results. 
Since September 2012, more than 14,000 people have ceased to use income security. At 6.7%, it is the lowest rate of preservatives since 1975. 
We also acted to create our identity, to take care of what we have more valuable. We take our responsibilities to build a more proud Quebec. 
Defending Quebec, it also means standing. We are a sovereignist one, and all my team acts to grow freedom of Quebec. 
We come there because you work in a team. Because we have the audacity to act. Because we want to get results. 
That's what we offer Quebeckers: a team, actions, results!
