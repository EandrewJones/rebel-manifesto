Quebec- The spokesperson for the Quebecois Financial and Income Party, Nicolas Marceau, and the Quebec-Canada and Francophonie Relations Spokesperson, Stéphane Bergeron, deplore that the Trudeau government is in its single securities commission project. MEPs wanted to react to the publication, today, a draft of the Capital Market Stability Act. 
"Justin Trudeau is in an insane project. He wants to swallow the Quebeckers forcibly a single securities commission. The Quebec business community has been united for several years against this project; Why Justin Trudeau does not listen to Quebec, who does not want it? Nicolas Marceau asked Nicolas Marceau. 
The publication of this draft speeds up the process. The cooperative regime, pushed by the Federal and Ontario, far from simplifying the supervision of the financial sector, comes instead dress up the true system of cooperation already existing between the provinces, and which works very well. The federal project, in addition to encroaching on the skills of Quebec, creating a double structure that would be nothing but a loss of time and money for Quebec companies. 
"Where are the 40 Quebec members of the Federal Liberal Caucus? Why do not they defend the Quebec consensus against this idea of a single securities commission? They must stand up and defend our skills against this encroachment from Ottawa. And to say that the Couillard Government had the opportunity, during the last federal election campaign, to remind the leaders of the federal parties the exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec on securities and to demand that they respect this exclusive jurisdiction. However, he chose not to do it and we must again deal with this federal project, "said Stéphane Bergeron. 
Remember that the National Assembly of Quebec voted six unanimous motions in this regard since 2006. "The more it changes, in Ottawa, the more it's the same. Quebec's wills will always go behind those of the rest of Canada, "concluded Nicolas Marceau.
