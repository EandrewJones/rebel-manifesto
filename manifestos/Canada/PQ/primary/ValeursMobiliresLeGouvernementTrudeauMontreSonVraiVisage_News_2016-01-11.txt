Qu√©bec- The Quebec Party Spokesperson in Finance and Income, Nicolas Marceau, regrets that the change of custody in Ottawa did not terminate the Federal Project to create a Canadian Securities Commission. 
"In Ottawa, the more it changes, the like the same. The Quebec business community for several years against this project must remain mobilized to make it sound to the Trudeau government, "said Marceau. 
The cooperative regime pushed by the Federal and Ontario, far from simplifying the supervision of the financial sector, rather resulted in the true system of cooperation already existing between the provinces, and which works very well. The federal project, in addition to encroaching on the skills of Quebec, creating a double structure that would be nothing but a loss of time and money for Quebec companies. 
Recall that the National Assembly of Quebec voted six unanimous motions in this regard since 2006. "It can be concluded that no matter the party in power in Ottawa, Quebeckers are not listened to," concluded Nicolas Marceau.
