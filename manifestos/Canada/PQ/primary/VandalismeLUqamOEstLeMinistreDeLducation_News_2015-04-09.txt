Québec- Following last night's events, the member for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, denounces violence and vandalism perpetrated at the University of Quebec in Montreal (UQAM). 
"Violence is still unacceptable. The reprehensible gestures of the commandos of masked and cottage protesters, directed against people and property, must be denounced because they discredit the civic mobilization movements. For us, it's zero tolerance. This morning, we launch a calm call; All stakeholders must dissociate themselves from these acts of violence. The Liberal government has the responsibility to soothe tensions, "said Stéphane Bédard. 
"Obviously, the government's left-way does not take advantage of anyone: neither students nor to teachers or administrations or police forces. We ask that student democracy be recognized, including the right to strike, which involves supervising, "he added. 
"The right to demonstrate is important in democracy, just as the right to freely express his opinions. Students can legitimately oppose liberal austerity. However, this must be done in accordance with laws and without violence. All parties have a responsibility and must denounce any act of violence and vandalism. The minister must calm down the game, and it is not inviting the rectors to expel two or three students a day or by throwing the oil on the fire that he fulfills his task. ", Concluded the leader of the official opposition.
