Montreal- As a result of the announcement of the sale of the company Fruits & Passion to Korean interests, leaving a possible closure of the Candiac plant and the possible loss of 200 jobs, the Minister Delegate to Industrial Policy And at the Quebec Economic Development Bank, Ms. Élaine Zakaïb, is committed to making any implementation to keep the production plant in Quebec and thus safeguard the maximum jobs in the region. 
"I can assure you that we will quickly gather the socio-economic actors concerned to assert the competitive advantages of Quebec to the new South Korean acquirer, TheFaceshop", and this, to convince him to maintain the production here, as had done. The previous purchaser, SC Johnson, said Élain Zakaïb. "We must unite our strengths and explore all possible avenues to get there. » 
Élain Zakaïb took the opportunity to recall the major role of the manufacturing sector in the Quebec economy. "This sector, despite its difficulties, remains one of our main sources of growth and productivity. It is therefore imperative for us to support our businesses. Quebec has all the assets required to meet the requirements of foreign purchasers. I trust that together, we will find the necessary arguments to convince the buyer to review his strategy and to minimize the consequences of this transaction, "concluded the delegated minister. 
The company founded by Quebeckers was sold to the Canadian subsidiary of American SC Johnson in 2008. It is the latter that comes to selling to the Korean business.
