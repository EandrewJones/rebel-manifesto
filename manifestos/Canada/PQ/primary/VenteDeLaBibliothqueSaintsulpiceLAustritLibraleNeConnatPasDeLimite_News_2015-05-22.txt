Quebec- The member for Joliette and sentence of the official opposition in the field of culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, deplores the Minister of Culture and Communications, Hélène David, put on sale, in Catimini, the One of the jewels of the Cultural Heritage Quebec, the Saint-Sulpice Library. 
The most troubling is that she used ads to liquidate a pan of our cultural history; There was neither announcement nor communicated or explanations. "For a government that is transparent, we will iron. The mandate of the Minister of Culture and Communications is to conserve the heritage, not to liquidate it! "," Said the hon. Member. 
We are witnessing once again, a break in the Liberal government. Indeed, Minister David said last October that she would launch a call for tenders to find a cultural vocation at the library. "What is the word of the minister? Liberal austerity knows no limit and broken promises, visibly, either, "continued Véronique Hivon. 
The Saint-Sulpice library is one of the greatest testimonials in the cultural history of Quebec; The minister therefore has the duty to keep it and protect it. "What did she do since his arrival? Has she planned on projects that fit with the cultural mission of this institution? Indeed, this building is not an ordinary building; It is a historical institution that is part of our heritage, "added the member. 
"Minister David shall withdraw the sale of the Saint-Sulpice Library, return to his comments in the fall of 2014 and commit to consulting the environment to find a solution that will respect the vocation of the building," concluded Véronique Hivon.
