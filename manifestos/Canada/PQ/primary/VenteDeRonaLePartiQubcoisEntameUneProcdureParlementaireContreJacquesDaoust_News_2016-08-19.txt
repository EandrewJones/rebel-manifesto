Québec- In the light of new revelations concerning the sale of the Fleuron of the Quebec economy RONA to the American Giant Lowe's, Alain Therrien, spokesman for the Québécois in the field of economy and deputy of Sanguinet, again requires the resignation of the Minister Jacques Daoust. He also reiterates his request for his former Chief of Cabinet, Pierre Ouellet, be heard at the parliamentary committee who will examine the sale of RONA. "Given what we know now, the Prime Minister can no longer oppose his appearance," he considers. 
"Jacques Daoust can repeat to whoever wants to hear that he has never allowed this transaction, but we are not fooled. The Auditor General's report, the minutes, his presence at an investment board of investment Québec and now the e-mails of his chief of staff, all that put together proves not only that he was put to Current, but also approved the transaction, "said the spokesperson. 
"How can the Prime Minister continue to play the ostrich and refuse to dismiss his minister? How can he accept that one mates thus? All the discredit of Jacques Daoust reflected on him and the Liberal government. With all the evidence we present, the Prime Minister will finally agree to recognize that his minister places him in an untenable situation, and that he must show him the exit? Alain Therrien pursued. 
"Jacques Daoust outrageously and deliberately lied to parliamentarians; In doing so, he, in our opinion, committed an outrage in Parliament. This morning, the Parti Québécois therefore forwarded to the President of the National Assembly, Jacques Chagnon, a letter in which he asked him to examine the question. We strongly believe that Jacques Daoust's lie should not remain unpunished. He lost the confidence of Quebeckers, he can no longer perform his duties, "concluded the member for Sanguinet.
