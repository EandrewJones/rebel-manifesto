Quebec- The official head of the official opposition of Jonquière, Sylvain Gaudreault, as well as the member for Sanguinet and spokesperson of the Parti Québécois in the field of economy, energy and natural resources, Alain Therien, ask the Minister of Economy, Science and Innovation, Dominique Anglade, to indicate how it intends to maintain Quebec products on RONA store tablets. 
"Before RONA be bought by Lowe's, 47% of the products that were sold came from Quebec suppliers. When Philippe Couillard has endorsed the sale, he chose to give up these businesses from home. By refusing to act for the protection of our headquarters and advocating for the free market, the Prime Minister defends the free choice of Lowe's to use his network of American suppliers from now on to supply his stores in Quebec, "summarized Sylvain Gaudreault . 
"In February, Minister Anglade promised to sit down with the new management of the company to ensure that jobs are kept and that suppliers are protected. She even shimmed the opportunity to increase their exports. Seven months later, while worry increases, it promises us "to accompany suppliers". Is she preparing to accompany them ... to the unemployment office? The perspective is rather frightening, "said Alain Therrien. 
"The company RONA, it was by far the largest distributor and retailer of hardware products in Quebec, and even in Canada. Only in Quebec, it represented the economic benefits of more than $ 2 billion a year and employed some 15,000 people in 343 stores. RONA allowed hundreds of Quebec suppliers to export in the rest of Canada. The Liberal government has made the choice to leave Rona. In the event of this fact accomplished, Minister Anglation must tell us how it will ensure that this decision does not have too dramatic consequences for Quebeckers, "concluded the official opposition.
