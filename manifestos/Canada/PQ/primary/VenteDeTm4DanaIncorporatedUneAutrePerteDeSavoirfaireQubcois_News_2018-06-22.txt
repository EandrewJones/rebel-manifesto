The official opposition spokeswoman, Alain Therrien, and the Energy Spokesman, Sylvain Rochon, strongly denounce the announced joint venture partnership that will make TM4, a hydro-hydro subsidiary Québec, the supplier of Dana Incorporated, an American company, for electric motors as well as the inverters and associated control systems. "In truth, TM4 has been sold, neither more nor less," they say. 
IN SHORT 
"By presenting the transaction as a" joint venture partnership ", the Liberal government and Hydro-Québec are trying to make believe that it is not a sale. However, the reality is that we have just lost control of our know-how, developed over the years thanks to the money of the taxpayers of Quebec. Today, we woke up by learning that a technology of the future developed here, by people from here, has just been sold to foreign interests. It's all but a good news, "said Alain Therrien. 
Sylvain Rochon is questioned for his part, in particular, of the intellectual property of TM4. "There is no commitment to its protection; It can therefore be feared that it is transferred to another subsidiary of Dana by a simple decision of the new owner. And what about production activities? There is no commitment guaranteeing that they will be developed in Quebec. It's more thanken! He insisted. 
"We wary because, the last time the government presented as good news the creation of a joint venture, it was in the case of the C Series. Since that time, we have seen, our 49.5% stake was diluted to 18.5%, and several activities were relocated to the United States. In summary, hundreds of millions of dollars for the C Series program will be used to create a factory as well as new jobs in Alabama, "concluded Alain Therien.
