Quebec -The MP for the Prairie and Official Opposition Spokesman on Financial Institutions and Entrepreneurship, François Rebello, claim from the Minister of Finance, Raymond Bachand, which he obtains additional guarantees to maintain and the development of financial sector activities in Montreal as part of the sale of the TMX group to the Maple Group. 
"We are in favor of this transaction by which the Maple Group, formed of several Quebec jewels, is acquiring the Montreal scholarship. It must also be made sure that the Group intends to maintain and even develop the activities of the financial sector in Montreal, "said the hon. Member for the Prairie. 
The Parti Québécois believes that Quebec is of interest to maintain a strong group of local institutional owners to develop the derivative stock exchange in Montreal. "Minister Bachand made a turn to 180 degrees, who had, without reservation, supported the purchase of the Montreal Stock Exchange by the London Stock Exchange. It's good, but it must now get more comprehensive guarantees, "says François Rebello.
