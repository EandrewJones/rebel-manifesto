Quebec- In order to support the victims of municipalities affected by the violent winds and abundant rains on July 19, 2013, the Minister of Public Safety, Mr. St√©phane Bergeron, announces that these municipalities and their citizens, as well as the companies and the Organizations established in their territory, can now benefit from the general financial assistance program during real or imminent claims. 
"The role of the department is to make every effort to support the municipal authorities and help all Quebeckers to ensure their safety and that of their property," said Bergeron. 
This government program constitutes the last resort and covers, in particular, the additional expenditure on current expenditure committed by municipalities for the deployment of temporary preventive, intervention and recovery measures, as well as certain damages suffered by the main residences and Municipal infrastructure that can not be covered by insurance. 
"The general financial assistance program puts a balm on the unfortunate events experienced by the victims. My priority as Minister of Public Security is to provide all necessary efforts for these people to regain tranquility and return to their normal life, "said Bergeron.
