I addressed myself last night at the National Youth Committee of the Parti Québécois (CNJPQ). I am always happy to find myself with them, to surround me with their energy, their vivacity of mind, their intelligence. 
One of my greatest pride is that we have been able to make room for a new generation in all party instances. The Parti Québécois has been renewed from the bottom. And the CNJPQ has been a major force of this renewal. 
Renewal of activists, deputies, ideas. Among these ideas, there is one that comes from the base, especially young people, and which revolves around the reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions, clean energies and transport: the electrification of our means of transport. 
It is a society project that relies on our most formidable natural resource: water. Half a century after René Lévesque has campaigned for the nationalization of hydroelectricity, we strongly believe that we must move to the next step: the electrification of our transport. 
It is a project of society to which we invite Quebeckers. A project that focuses on innovation and research. A project that focuses on businesses that manufacture buses, trains, metro wagons and batteries for electric vehicles. 
It is a project that puts on clean energies that are hydroelectricity and wind. 
It is a project that will allow us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and respect our commitment to the planet, to future generations. 
This is a project that will allow us to create quality jobs at home and reduce our oil imports, reduce our trade deficit. 
It is a project that has the potential to make Quebec a leader in the world and one of the most prosperous places in the Americas. 
It is a project that will bring us back the pride. 
Transport electrification is the 21st century project for Quebec.
