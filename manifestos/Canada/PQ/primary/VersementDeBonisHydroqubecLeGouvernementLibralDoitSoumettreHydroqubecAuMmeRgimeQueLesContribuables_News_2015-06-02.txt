Quebec- The member for Marie-Victorin and the official opposition on energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, condemns the Government for allowing the return of premiums to executives and senior executives of hydro- Quebec; He recalled that during this time, in addition to being surfactured by the Crown corporation, taxpayers see their taxes increase and reduce the services offered to them. 
"Taking into account the $ 67 million is unduly invoiced to customers with an intelligent counter, abusive interest rates of 14.4% that the state monopoly imposes on consumers, the payment of a princely pension of more than $ 450,000, indexed annually, for the former CEO Thierry Vandal, or hundreds of millions of dollars spent unnecessarily in the erratic management of the closure of the Gentilly II nuclear power plant, it is obvious that the Hydro-Québec's senior executives do not deserve to be rewarded, while Quebeckers see their electricity bill because of all these bad decisions, "said Bernard Drainville. 
The hon. Member recalls that since 2010, provisions have compelled the leaders of Crown corporations to make an effort comparable to that of the rest of the public sector for the budget-balancing period; However, Bill 28, adopted under gag by the Liberal government, came to remove these constraints, devoting the return of bonuses to senior executives. 
"The Parti Québécois voted against; It is therefore per gag that the Liberal government has brought back the performance bonuses. The practice is all the more scandalous as these premiums are totally unjustified. Moreover, is not it the Minister of Natural Resources, Pierre Arcand, who admitted last week that Quebeckers had less money in their pockets since the election of the Liberals? How, in this context, can the government leave Hydro-Québec pay premiums, funded by Quebecers, to its senior executives? It is his duty to put an end to it, "concluded Bernard Drainville.
