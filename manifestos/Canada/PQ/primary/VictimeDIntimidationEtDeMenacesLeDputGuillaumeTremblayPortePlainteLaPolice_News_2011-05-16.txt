Québec-The member for Masson, Guillaume Tremblay, met with the investigators of the Sûreté du Québec as a result of an altercation that occurred in Mascouche. Mr. Tremblay complained officially. 
Mr. Tremblay introduced himself to a Mascouche restaurant on the evening of May 12th. A few minutes after his arrival, in the presence of family members and a friend, Mr. Tremblay was intimidated and threatened by two individuals who would be related to the construction community. 
Since an inquiry is in progress, there will be no further comment.
