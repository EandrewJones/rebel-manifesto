Québec- The member for Taschereau and spokesman for the Québécois party in secularism, Agnès Maltese, welcomes the withdrawal of Part 1 of Bill 59, that including all articles related to hate speeches. She greets, moreover, the unanimity of the vote held this afternoon in the National Assembly. 
"After one year of debates and discussions in parliamentary committee, after the rejection by the majority of the population and almost all the partners of the partnership on hate speech, the minister finally hears right and withdraws it. As of August 2015, we asked for the split of the bill so that hate speeches and forced marriages be treated separately. This will have taken 8 months of work in committee to get there, but we are there, "said Agnès Maltais. 
"It was obvious to all that restrict freedom of expression was a nonsense, a dangerous avenue in which the government was committed. This could have introduced a climate of harmful self-censorship for our social and democratic life. The solution to counter hate speech will always remain freedom of expression in itself and the debates to which it gives rise. We look forward to the decline of Minister Valley; It is a great victory for the population and freedom of expression, "concluded the spokesperson.
