Quebec- The member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and sentence of the official opposition in terms of women's condition, Carole Poirier, as well as the member for Taillon and spokesperson for health and accessibility to care, Diane Lamarre , rejoice that the Liberal government has finally agreed to support the motion of the Parti Québécois requesting that the Bill 20 be withdrawn all the measures limiting the rights of women and access to abortion. 
"After refusing to support our motion last week, the government finally came back to reason and retracted in its willingness to impose quotas in abortion. It's a victory for women's rights. Dozens of women and men working in the health network worried, with reason, quotas about the number of abortions contained in the Minister of Health Regulations. We did not discourage ourselves at the first stubbornness of the Liberal Party, and we will continue to ensure an active watch so that no further action comes to brush the rights of Quebeckers, "said Carole Poirier. 
"Today, by committing to that no action by Bill 20 will limit the rights of women or the number of abortions that a physician can do, the Minister of Health shall admit that his draft regulation must be clarified. As an official position, we will make sure that no quota is in the final regulation of the Minister. It is his responsibility to protect the rights of women, and we look forward to it today ", concluded Diane Lamarre. 
The motion adopted unanimously reads as follows: 
"That the National Assembly reiterates the right of any woman to dispose of his body and free and accessible abortion services; 
That the Government ensure that no action related to Bill 20, An Act to enact the law promoting access to family medicine and specialized medicine services and amending various legislative provisions on assisted procreation, does not limit in any way these rights. »
