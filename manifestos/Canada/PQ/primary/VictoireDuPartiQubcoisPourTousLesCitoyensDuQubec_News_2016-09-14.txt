Quebec, on September 14, 2016 -After months of hard work, the member for Taillon and spokesman for the Quebecois health and accessibility of care, Diane Lamarre, is pleased that the Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette , has announced the abolition of ancillary fees, which represented an injustice and a real obstacle to access to essential services for patients literally taken hostage. Nevertheless, Ms. Lamarre warns the minister: the record of ancillary fees must in no way lead to the addition, through a negotiating negotiation, of sums in the compensation envelopes of the doctors. 
"After defending for years the legalization of ancillary fees, first as President of the Federation of Specialist Physicians and as Liberal Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette recedes today on this major issue for all Quebeckers and all Quebeckers : No more citizen will be obliged to release his credit card at the same time as his health insurance card for insured health services, "said Diane Lamarre. 
"It's a victory for the Québécois party because we have led this battle for the abolition of surfacturation for years, but it is first and foremost a victory for the 8 million Quebeckers that I defend daily. I want to emphasize the mobilization of dozens of groups - in particular formed of citizens, professionals, doctors, representatives of professional orders, seniors, and I pass - who dared to publicly denounce the intention of the Minister of Legalize ancillary fees. Gaétan Barrette wanted to legalize the illegal by denying the injustice that the incorporated fees would generate. I am glad that Quebec patients are now exempted, "added the spokesperson. 
However, it prevents the Minister of Health: The Parti Québécois will continue its work with rigor to ensure that the invoice will not be indirectly reflected in Québec taxpayers. "We will ensure that doctors' remuneration is not borne in Catimini, as a result of negotiations that would be held behind closed doors," she concluded.
