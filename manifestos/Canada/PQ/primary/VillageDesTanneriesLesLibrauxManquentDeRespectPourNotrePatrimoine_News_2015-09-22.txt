Quebec- The member for Vachon and spokespersons of the Quebec's transport, Martine Ouellet, and the member for Joliette and spokesperson for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, deplore the attitude of the Cuteillard government in the Folder of the village of tanneries, an archaeological site located near the new Turcot exchanger. 
"The supposed government of transparency has doubled its affront's wrongs taking advantage of a weekend day to shave part of the village of tanneries. To defend themselves, the Minister of Transport minimizes the extent of the discovery, while historians and archaeologists state, on the contrary that the site is of importance. He did not even have been possible to get the details of the scenarios envisaged to save the village, as if the department had never evaluated this possibility, "said Martine Ouellet. 
"Where is the Minister of Culture and what does she do to protect the site? Hurry up; If nothing is done by the end of the week, there will be the village of the tanneries as artifacts and maybe some pallets of stone. The Minister of Transport and the Minister of Culture must find real solutions, in all transparency and in concert with the environment. The latter, moreover, has the duty to protect the heritage of Quebecers, and it must not emerge from its responsibilities. However, after the sad episode of the Saint-Sulpice library and that of the heritage building located at 3725 Saint-Denis Street, in Montreal, again, it sends a very bad message as to the importance it gives to the preservation of our collective memory, "Concluded Véronique Hivon.
