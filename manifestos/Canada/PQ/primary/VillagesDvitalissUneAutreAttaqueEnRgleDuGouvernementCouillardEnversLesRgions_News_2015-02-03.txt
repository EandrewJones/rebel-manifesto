Québec- The member for Gaspé and official opposition spokesperson for municipal affairs and regional development, Gaétan Lelièvre, denounces the abolition of the Fund of support for the difficulty territories (FSTD). He asks the Minister of Municipal Affairs and the occupation of the territory, Pierre Moreau, to return to his decision, which constitutes a new attack on the development of the regions. 
"In all our regions, the liberal sacking continues; Once again, no one will be spared. After cutting the resources and development tools of the regions, including local development centers and elected regional conferences, and imposed cuts of 300 million in the municipal world, the government continues to asphyxiate our regions. The same day when the Council of the Patronat du Québec (CPQ) apologizes for proposing to relocate families of the devitalized regions towards the major centers, it is learned that the Minister cuts a fund of 53 million for the villages in difficulty. Decidedly, the Liberals have no vision of the occupation of our territory. These municipalities need support and a structuring plan to maximize their development, "said Gaétan Lelièvre.

"Who was the minister trying to convince, last Friday? How could he reject the CPQ proposal, while still worse, totally abolishing the FSTD, the main tool to help the most vulnerable municipalities? Obviously, he talks about both sides of the mouth! It's a sad day for Quebec. The government needs to decline; This measure is insane ", concluded Gaétan Lelièvre.
