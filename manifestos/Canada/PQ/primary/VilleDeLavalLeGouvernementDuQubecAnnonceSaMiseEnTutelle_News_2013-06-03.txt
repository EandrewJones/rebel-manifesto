Quebec- The Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the Territory and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announces the Government's decision to subjected the City of Laval at the control of the Quebec City Commission (CMQ ) 
"Our government was quick to answer Laval's request and put the city under guardianship. Through this action, we take the necessary means to restore confidence to the population and to ensure the good administration of the municipality, and this, in the interest of all citizens. From now on, I have full confidence in the CMQ that will play its role in exercising control over the decisions of the city, "said Minister Gaudreault. 
The subjugation of a municipality to the control of the CMQ is a temporary measure that takes effect from the promulgation of the decree by the Government. As an independent administrative organization, the Municipal Commission of Quebec, during a guardianship, approves or not the decisions taken by the municipality concerned.
