Quebec- The Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the Territory and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, takes note of the remarks held by the Mayor of the City of Laval, Mr. Alexandre Duplessis, and his request for Subject the city to the control of the Quebec Municipal Commission (CMQ). 
"I take note of the demand of the mayor of the city of Laval. This is a good decision. Over the past year, a series of exceptional events has come to mark the business management of the city and seriously weakening the confidence of the population with regard to its administration. I recognize that it is in the interest of the city of Laval and its population that an action is undertaken quickly to restore the credibility of the municipal administration by the intervention of the CMQ. I therefore undertake to prepare the decree and bring it to the Council of Ministers because, in this case, it is the government that has to subject a municipality to the control of the CMQ, "said Minister Gaudreault. 
The first step is taking a decree by the government. This decree may take effect from its promulgation. Subsequently, the CMQ publishes an opinion to the official Gazette du Qu√©bec mentioning the subjugation of the municipality to its control. At the time of a guardianship, the CMQ exercises its monitoring functions as determined by law, approving whether or not the decisions taken by the municipality concerned.
