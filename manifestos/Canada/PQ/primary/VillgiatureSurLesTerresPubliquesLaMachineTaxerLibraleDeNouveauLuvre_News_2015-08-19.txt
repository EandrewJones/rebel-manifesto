Quebec- The hon. Member for Bonaventure and the official opposition spokesman for forest, wildlife and parks, Sylvain Roy, denounces the abusive rise in rents imposed on the owners of cottages built on public lands, which, which, In some cases, can reach 530%. He asks the government to come back to reason and retreat on its intentions. 
"With these increases, we go to the pure and simple privatization of a territory that belongs to Quebecers and Quebeckers. This decision is completely against the democratic principle of public land use by citizens, without discrimination as to their income or social status. Because of these abusive increases, several resorts, including sports hunting, will have to leave their cottage, unable to pay what they are claimed. Do we want to come back to the occupation of public land by private clubs, a practice yet abolished in Quebec in the late 1970s by Yves Duhaime and the government of the Parti Québécois? "Asked Sylvain Roy. 
Several decades of occupation of the territory
The spokesman also deplores the fact that this decision is a new direct attack on the regions of Quebec, where the majority of Quebec public land is. It is also an affront to the citizens who have been building and improving their place of resort for several decades, holding that the rent price will remain accessible. "Several tenants of resort leases have arranged paths and worked on the improvement of public lands and are told, overnight: the rates increase and, if you do not have the means to pay, you do not Have more your place on the public lands Quebec. It's completely scandalous! The Minister of Natural Resources, Pierre Arcand, as responsible for the management of state land, must tell us that his government has already forgotten this very bad idea, "concluded the hon. Member for Bonaventure.
