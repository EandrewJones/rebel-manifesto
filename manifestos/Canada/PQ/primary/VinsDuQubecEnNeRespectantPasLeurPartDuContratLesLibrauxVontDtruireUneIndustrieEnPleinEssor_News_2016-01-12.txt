Quebec- In front of the unilateral lowering of the ceiling of the Québec winegrowers program, the spokesman for the Parti Québécois in agriculture, André Villeneuve, requires the Government to respect his share of the contract and pays all the amounts planned. 
Indeed, while it was previously $ 300,000, the Liberals reduced, without warning, the ceiling of the $ 100,000 aid program. "The Parti Québécois, enhanced the program, allowed producers to make significant investments in their businesses. The fact that the Liberals come to deny a government commitment thus puts all these entrepreneurs in an untenable financial situation. More than a broken promise, it's downright a breach of contract! The winemakers planned their development according to the amounts provided for in the Government. They borrowed important sums to invest, and there, the Liberals refuse to respect their share of the contract! It's totally irresponsible to act in this way and thus putting a hardware of an industry, "denounced André Villeneuve. 
Recall that before the holidays, the spokesperson had to intervene in the National Assembly, as the previous year, for the Minister of Finance Carlos Leitão, undertakes to pay the aid provided for in Quebec winemakers. Now, despite its promise, only a part of the sums has been paid. However, the results of this aid program, set up by the Parti Québécois, had surpassed all expectations: sales of Quebec products had increased by 60%. 
" This is unacceptable. For the last two years, the Liberal government has been delivering its commitments, abandons the winemakers and sabots their efforts. He should support them, but he is destroying a growing industry in full swing. The Liberals must immediately reduce the ceiling to $ 300,000 and pay our entrepreneurs the total amounts that had been originally planned, "concluded the member for Berthier.
