Quebec, March 24, 2017- The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in the field of women's status, Mireille John, and the public safety spokesman Pascal Bérubé, arrest the ministers of public safety and responsible for the status of women's , Martin Coiteous and Lise Thériault, so that the 2012-2017 Government Action Plan for Domestic Violence is finally implemented. 
"When setting up the action plan, an awareness campaign was planned. Why did the Liberal government ever start? In fact, the Liberals did nothing, concretely, to advance the fight against spousal violence. The Québécois party had made it a priority when he developed the action plan, "said Mireille Jean. 
"Martin Closedeux must take the situation in hand and stop procrastinating. He must also tell us why the Death Review Committee in a context of domestic violence does not exist yet. This aspect is one of the most important of the action plan; The creation of this committee is claimed by the grouping of houses for women victims of spousal violence for a long time, "added Pascal Bérubé. 
"Before being responsible for the Status of Women, Lise Thériault was Minister of Public Safety; It should therefore be twice as aware of the issue of spousal violence! So, why is we waiting for three years the annual balance sheets of the action plan? It is scandalous than less than a year from his deadline, the minister did not play a more active role in implementing it. Has the plan simply been set aside? "Asked Mireille Jean.
