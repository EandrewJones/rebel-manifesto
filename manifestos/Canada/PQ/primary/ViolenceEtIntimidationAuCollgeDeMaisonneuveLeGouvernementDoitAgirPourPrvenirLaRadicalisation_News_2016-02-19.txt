Québec- MP Agnès Maltais, an assistant parliamentary leader of the official opposition and spokesperson for the Partiéciois on secularism, relies heavily on the allegations that there would be violence and intimidation at the Collège de Maisonneuve. According to the Journalla Presse, which reports this story this morning, one of the individuals in question would be linked to a terrorist group. 
"During the election campaign, the Prime Minister had committed to combating radicalization and religious fundamentalism. However, all we have on the table for the moment, it is a bill that attacks the freedom of expression of all Quebeckers, "said Agnès Maltais. 
Remember that the Parti Québécois has already proposed the establishment of an observatory of religious fundamentalism. Bill 395 was inspired by the work of the former Liberal MP Fatima Houda-Pepin, the very one who was expelled from the Liberal Party Caucus by Philippe Couillard because it took the threat of religious funding seriously and that she required firm actions on the part of her leader. Two years later, we are still waiting and dissatisfaction rides, because the Liberal government, chilly, continues to turn their thumbs up. 
"I repeat: Bill 59 is a liberticide bill, and it is not at all adequate to combat radicalization or prevent situations like the one that seems to have courses at the Maisonneuve College. What we need is additional resources. Thus, educational institutions and police officers would be able to properly apply the provisions of the Criminal Code, which already allow to pursue the dangerous preachers. Create a fundamentalism observatory would be a good step in this direction, "concluded the member for Taschereau.
