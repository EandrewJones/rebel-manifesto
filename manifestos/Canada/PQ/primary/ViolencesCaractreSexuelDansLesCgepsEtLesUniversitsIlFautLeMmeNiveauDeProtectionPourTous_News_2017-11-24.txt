IN SHORT 
"This bill was very expected. It is an important step for raising awareness, prevention and fight against sexual violence. At the end of the particular consultations, it seems obvious, however, that Bill 151 must be firmer and aimed at a greater standardization of policies, with the aim of ensuring the same level of protection to all students and all the students. Students, regardless of the establishment attended. The severity of an act of sexual violence does not vary by region, "said Catherine Fournier. 
"We expect the bill to clearly prohibit the intimate bonds between a student and a staff member of the educational institution if there is also, between the two, a relationship that could have an impact on the school path of the student. However, this would not apply if the intimate link existed before the strictly educational relationship, "said Simon such. 
"It is also necessary to ensure effective complaints and reports: support in less than 5 days, and complete process in 45 days maximum. To do this, of course, sufficient human and financial resources will have to be at the rendezvous. In addition, any limitation period must be prohibited, "added Jason St-Amour. 
"Everyone recognizes that the fight against sexual violence is a fundamental societal issue. That is why I am convinced that we can continue the work of collaboration with the other parties during the detailed study of the bill, in order to provide the necessary clarifications, "concluded the spokesperson.
