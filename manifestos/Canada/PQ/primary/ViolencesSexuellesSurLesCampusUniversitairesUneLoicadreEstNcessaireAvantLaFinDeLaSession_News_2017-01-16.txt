Quebec, on January 16, 2017-as a result of the publication of the results of the Sexuality Survey, Security and Interactions in the University (Essimu), the spokesman for the Parti Party for Education, Research, School Persisher and literacy, Alexander Cloutier, and the spokesperson for the status of women, Mireille John, again ask the government to adopt a framework law to counter sexual violence in academia. 
"The portrait of sexual assaults in the universities drawn up in the report is extremely disturbing. The phenomenon is real, it even becomes a plague. We have a long time ago we ask the government to act and file a law? Framework that attacks itself in a muscular way. Unfortunately, for almost two and a half years, it was a radio silence on the file to the government. It took last fall events at Laval University so that it finally decides to move forward. For now, Minister David leaves all open doors; A framework law, a framework policy, a plan of action ... The researchers were clear during their press conference: to finally counter the phenomenon, it will take muscular means, and that the sums are at the rendezvous . The Minister must undertake to file a framework law before the end of the parliamentary session, "said Alexander Cloutier. 
"Sexual violence on university campuses is not an isolated situation. It turns out the manifestation that inequalities persist between women and men in Quebec society. The solutions to this phenomenon must be designed from a global perspective, not just on the campus. That is, actions must be combined, including public health, education, public safety and justice. But, first of all, we must stop targeting the victims and tackle, rather, to people who commit sexual violence and the culture of rape, "added Mireille Jean.
