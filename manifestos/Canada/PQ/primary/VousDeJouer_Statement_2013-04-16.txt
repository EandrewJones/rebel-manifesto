That's it! The new Parti Québécois website and the campaign to promote sovereignty are launched! 
We sincerely thank all those who participated yesterday in Montreal, Quebec City and anywhere else through webcast. It was an important first appointment, but the suite depends on you. 
We have worked very hard in recent months to give us both a platform for broadcasting and activating state-of-the-art, and a promotional plan that allows us today to restore us to the country . 
Social media is a precious tool whose sovereignist movement did not have in 1980 and in 1995. If we all put ours from today, if we make every effort to talk about it, to disseminate arguments , to convince refractories, it can go very fast. 
We went to 50,000 yes of the country in 1995. It is now a question of going to convince them, one by one. Every little gesture will count. 
It's your turn!
