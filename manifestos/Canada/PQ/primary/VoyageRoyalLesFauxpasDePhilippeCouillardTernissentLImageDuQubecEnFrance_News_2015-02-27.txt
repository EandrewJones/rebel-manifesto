Quebec- The member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and sentence of the official opposition on international relations, Carole Poirier, deplores the series of false steps and unfortunate declarations of the Liberal government and Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, who tarnish The image of Quebec in France. 
"In this period of Liberal-Caquist austerity, the fact that six ministers accompany the prime minister abroad is an insult to Quebec families, who are attacked hard by blind cuts, based solely on an accounting logic. The Figaro said aloud that diplomats will not publicly say: the Government of Philippe Couillard humiliated the Government of France by tripling the tuition fees of French students, and the Prime Minister adds by justifying his royal visit with six Ministers by the fact that it is not so expensive since our guests pay the expenses of housing and land transport, "said Carole Poirier. 
"The Government of the Liberal Party is only multiplying the kingdoms towards France; it is shameful. All previous governments, or liberals, have always demonstrated great sensitivity for the privileged relationship that Quebec has with France. By insulting the French-rehearsal French, the provincial government of Philippe Couillard is ransacing this historical relationship. The Prime Minister should apologize for the displaced words he has kept and who shocked the French, "concluded the member.
