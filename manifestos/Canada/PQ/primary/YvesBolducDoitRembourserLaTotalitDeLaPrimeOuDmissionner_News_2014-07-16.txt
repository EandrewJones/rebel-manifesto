Quebec, July 16, 2014 -The MP for Taschereau and Parliamentary Leader of the Official Opposition, Agnès Maltese, and the member for Taillon and Spokesperson for Health and Accessibility to Care, Diane Lamarre, deemed insufficient repayment What would the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport do, Yves Bolduc. According to them, the Minister must reimburse the entire premium of $ 215,000 or take the only other decision to resign. 
"After defending his minister and talked about a storm in a glass of water, the Prime Minister admitted that his minister was imprudent by taking charge of 1600 patients. He then mentioned tags for the part-time work of the deputies and stated that the premium system missed his target. Philippe Couillard must stop denying the obviousness and demanding the total repayment of the premium, "said Agnès Maltais. 
By proposing to reimburse only the amount that the RAMQ will call it and to give equivalent to an organization, the Minister respects only the administrative rule concerning the patient's follow-up and not the very spirit of the premium, which is to encourage a support for the patient. 
"This case could have been settled from the moment we raised the issue at the National Assembly. Refunding a part is not enough; It is all the 1600 patients of Minister Bolduc who no longer has a doctor, who is not supported and who today must find another doctor. The more time passes, the minus the population includes the resistance of the minister, who must act responsibly and exemplary, "continued Diane Lamarre.
