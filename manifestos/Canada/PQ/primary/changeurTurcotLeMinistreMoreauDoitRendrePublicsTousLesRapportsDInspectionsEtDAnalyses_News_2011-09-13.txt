Montreal -The MP for Gouin and official opposition spokesperson for transport, Nicolas Girard, press the new Minister of Transport, Pierre Moreau, to make public reports and documents relating to the Turcot exchanger. "Minister Moreau promised to implement a culture of transparency: that he spends speech on acts," said Nicolas Girard. 
In a response to a request for access to information, the Parti Québécois discovered that last March, the Ministry of Transport of Quebec (MTQ) authorized an additional $ 4.5 million at the SNC-Lavalin consortium. / CIMA + / Dessau mandated for monitoring and inspection of the Turcot exchanger. Initially, the contract granted was $ 15 million. It is therefore a 30% increase from the original contract. 
"What justifies such cost overrun? What is the consortium discovered worrying so that the bill swells as much? Engineers have produced reports and analyzes for the Ministry of Transport on the state of the Turcot exchanger. Yet the public always ignores the content. These reports and analyzes must be made public to citizens. After all, it is the taxpayers who pay the bill, "pursued Nicolas Girard. 
The member for Gouin reminds that last spring, the MTQ had urgently made the closing of lanes on the Turcot exchanger. Now, a few days later, we learned that the MTQ had not given the right time on the actual closing patterns. 
"It has been reported when you broadcast information to the dropper to avoid being embarrassed. In the case of the Turcot exchanger, the Liberal government has shifted by its many years of undecisions. Turcot, it's 300,000 vehicles every day that borrow 13 straps. With such a high daily flow, it is the largest motorway crossroads of the metropolis. We are entitled to the truth and we want to get it in the coming hours, not in the coming months, "concluded Nicolas Girard.
