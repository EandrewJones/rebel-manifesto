Quebec - The member for Taschereau and official opposition spokesperson for health, Agnès Maltais, revealed this morning to the National Assembly that 235,000 Quebecers could today have access to a family doctor if the government Liberal had acted to prevent doctors from withdrawing from the public health system.
“In 2004, there were 79 doctors who were withdrawn from the public health system. Today, there are 251. Of this number, 157 are family physicians. If the Minister of Health had acted to prevent these family doctors from leaving for the private sector, 235,000 more Quebeckers would have free access to a family doctor, ”said Agnès Maltais during question period.
The Parti Québécois is concerned about the techniques used by private health clinics to attract clients. “We suggest, through an advertisement, that we can give a loved one a doctor as a Christmas present. Quebecers don&#39;t have to wait for Santa Claus to have access to a doctor! If we have come to this, it is because the government is doing nothing to bring physicians back into the public health system or to prevent them from swelling the ranks of the private sector. It is not only worrying, it is unacceptable, ”she added.
In addition, the member for Taschereau pointed out that several investigations conducted by the Régie de l&#39;assurance maladie du Québec are slow to be completed and involve private clinics that charge a high price for access to a doctor. “For the past 18 months, we have been impatiently awaiting the results of three investigations involving, in particular, the Plexo clinic in Montreal, whose shareholder is the co-founder of the CAQ and friend of François Legault, Charles Sirois. There is also the case of the Medisys 123 clinic and that of the Physimed clinic. In short, by not clarifying what is legal and illegal, what interests is Minister Yves Bolduc protecting? », Concluded Agnès Maltais.
