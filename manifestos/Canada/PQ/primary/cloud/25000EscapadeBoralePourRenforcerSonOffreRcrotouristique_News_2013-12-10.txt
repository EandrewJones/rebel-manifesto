Chibougamau - The Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Natural Resources (northern development component) and Member of Parliament for Ungava, Mr. Luc Ferland, on behalf of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announces the allocation of financial assistance of $ 25,000 to Escapade boréale for the realization of a project to train specialized guides and create tourist packages, combining snowmobiling and Cree culture.
A non-profit organization jointly run by Jamesians and Crees, Escapade boréale has specialized, since 2010, in the organization and development of adventure tourism in Nord-du-Québec, in harmony with local communities. . The assistance granted will enable it to strengthen its tourism offer by launching new packages integrating Cree culture and snowmobiling, which will be offered in winter 2014. In addition, two training sessions will be offered to a group of ten participants. The first will focus on first aid in isolated areas and the second on safety when riding an off-road vehicle. Escapade boréale thus seeks to create, in collaboration with the community of Waswanipi, tourist products that would be offered by Cree guides on the outskirts of the federated snowmobile trails.
“It is with great pride that our government supports this burgeoning organization, which quickly acquired great notoriety in Quebec. I have the strong conviction that this structuring project will promote the creation of stimulating jobs for our community, will contribute to the safeguard of the local Cree culture and will make it possible to position the Nord-du-Québec as the destination par excellence for the northern expedition. »Declared MP Luc Ferland.
Financial assistance comes from the conjunctural development fund of the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy.
