Québec, July 8, 2016 - While 27,400 full-time jobs were lost in June, the leader of the official opposition and member for Jonquière, Sylvain Gaudreault, the Parti Québécois spokesperson for Finance and Income Critic Nicolas Marceau, Economy Critic Alain Therrien and Employment Critic Dave Turcotte urged the Prime Minister to act for jobs and development economy of Quebec.
&quot;We have before us a government of? Fart? braces that congratulated himself last month, will he react with the same energy when he lost 27,400 full-time jobs? We have seen many large-scale announcements in recent months, but nothing in them was concrete for jobs and economic development. Smoke screens have become this government&#39;s great specialty. Workers and regions need more than empty ads, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
“Since the Liberals came to power, we have experienced austerity, budget cuts, increased taxes and job creation is anemic. The Prime Minister&#39;s promise to create 250,000 jobs is a myth that is being confirmed month after month. The Liberals brazenly lied to Quebeckers, ”added Nicolas Marceau.
“Quebec&#39;s economic development has stalled. Very few resources are announced by the government, apart from great big policies unveiled with great fanfare, such as energy policy and digital strategy, to name just a few. There is nothing concrete to support our businesses and entrepreneurs, our SMEs, those who create jobs in all regions of Quebec, ”continued Alain Therrien.
“Austerity and budget cuts in all sectors are hurting the economy. Quebec workers continue to lose their jobs. Quebeckers have no confidence in this government. A real economic policy, with clear and concrete objectives, must be put in place as quickly as possible, ”concluded Dave Turcotte.
