Montreal - “The election campaign is only four days old and the job loss toll is already impressive: 360 workers have lost their jobs since last Wednesday. On the day of the outbreak, the Novelis company closed its doors, throwing 160 workers in Saguenay onto the street. Yesterday, the Paccar plant in Sainte-Thérèse announced the layoff of 200 workers, to the great indifference of the Liberal government. Jean Charest should be ashamed of claiming to be the champion of the economy in the face of such a record, ”said the Parti Québécois candidate in the Rousseau riding, Nicolas Marceau.
“Jean Charest has just demonstrated that the economy is a priority only in his speeches and not in his actions. These 360 workers lost their jobs with the greatest indifference to the Prime Minister, who was more concerned about his re-election than the fate of these families. In addition, Jean Charest promised at the same time to create 250,000 jobs by 2017 by copying the projections of an Emploi-Québec report dating from 2011, a promise described as not very ambitious by many, ”added Nicolas Marceau. .
The Parti Québécois candidate in the constituency of Groulx, Raymond Archambault, recalled that in 1999, the Parti Québécois government managed to save the jobs of workers at the Paccar factory through its muscular interventions. “A Parti Québécois government will once again do everything it can to preserve the jobs of the Paccar workers, contrary to liberal indifference. If he really wanted to be a champion of the economy, Jean Charest would meet the expectations of the employees of the Paccar factory and their families. &quot;
“From 1998 to 2003, the Parti Québécois government contributed to the creation of 362,000 jobs, including 124,000 in 2002 alone, while Pauline Marois was Minister of Finance,” concluded Nicolas Marceau.
