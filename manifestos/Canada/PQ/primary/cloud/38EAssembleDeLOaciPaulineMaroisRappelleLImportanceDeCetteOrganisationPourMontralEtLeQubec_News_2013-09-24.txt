Its future is here. I am proud of the fight we have led to keep it in the metropolis, where it represents the heart of our aeronautics industry. With more than 200 companies, 42,000 jobs and a turnover of 12.1 billion dollars, Montreal is undoubtedly the world capital of civil aviation ”, affirmed Pauline Marois.
