Montreal - The Parti Québécois candidate in the riding of Rousseau and Minister of Finance and the Economy, Nicolas Marceau, and the candidate in the riding of Taschereau and Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Agnès Maltais, are delighted the confirmation by the Institut de la statistique du Québec (ISQ) of the creation of 47,800 jobs in Quebec in 2013.
“The ISQ confirms what we have been saying for months: jobs are being created steadily in Quebec, in accordance with our forecasts. With 47,800 jobs, 2013 is therefore better than 2012, which ended with an increase of 30,800 jobs. The ISQ report also confirms that the majority of these are permanent and full-time jobs, and that employment in Quebec is growing at a rate similar to that of Canada and Ontario ”, declared Nicolas Marceau.
“The Liberal Party of Quebec has been trying for months to make Quebeckers believe that the economy is doing badly, and that we are on the verge of disaster. Today, we have proof that this is wrong, and that the job market is doing well. We must not be fooled by the alarmist rhetoric of the Liberal Party, ”added Agnès Maltais.
“The Priority Economic Policy is starting to bear fruit, and we must continue the work. The Parti Québécois is determined to create jobs in all regions of Quebec. We have the best team to rigorously manage public finances, reduce debt, and support entrepreneurs and job creation, ”Minister Marceau concluded.
