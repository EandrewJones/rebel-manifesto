Quebec City, February 27, 2017– The Parti Québécois culture and communications spokesperson, Agnès Maltais, said she was very proud of the fact that many Quebec filmmakers are now shining on the world stage. She obviously mentioned Sylvain Bellemare, who won, yesterday at the Oscars, the statuette rewarding the best sound editing for the film Arrival, by the filmmaker Denis Villeneuve.
“On behalf of the Parti Québécois, I warmly congratulate Sylvain Bellemare and the entire Arrival team, including Denis Villeneuve, for this exceptional award. Their names are added to the list of women and men who make Quebec shine on the international artistic scene. And it is a real pride to note that year after year, this list is only growing ”, declared, at the outset, the spokesperson.
The Oscars remains the most prestigious and popular event of the year in the world of cinema; To shine there is synonymous with immense talent, it goes without saying. During this 89th edition, like the previous ones, several Quebecers were in the running, moreover. “For years, in Quebec, we have been aware of the excellence and originality of our cinema. And this applies as much to actresses and actors as to those exercising a technical profession, often less known to the general public, less highlighted. Today, through the Academy, the whole world recognizes these qualities in our seventh art. For a nation of our size, this is sensational! », Continued Agnès Maltais.
“Quebec cinema is now one of the best; he entered through the front door, the one bordered by a red carpet. And, given the energy, creativity and know-how of its artisans, it&#39;s a safe bet that this great momentum will continue ... to our greatest pleasure, ”she concluded.
