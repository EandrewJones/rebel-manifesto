Montreal - The Parti Québécois this morning launched a fundraising campaign to promote Sovereignty on television channels in Quebec. A video inviting sovereignists to make a donation specifically to contribute to this campaign was made public this morning. The video can be viewed on YouTube at http://youtu.be/BVDtqrGOtVg.
The decision to hold this campaign was taken at the National Council of the Parti Québécois last February and is part of the Party&#39;s action plan adopted by its members.
Article number 1 of the Parti Québécois&#39; program is to &quot;achieve the sovereignty of Quebec&quot;, so it should come as no surprise that the latter promotes it in all possible forums.
Moreover, for four months, the Parti Québécois has been promoting Sovereignty on social networks, it is now time to go further on the mass media.
“All the money collected for the promotional campaign until October 15 will be used to finance our television presence. This campaign will promote Sovereignty. The Parti Québécois therefore invites all Sovereignists of all stripes to participate and to share the word, ”explains Raymond Archambault, President of the Parti Québécois.
