La Sarre - The Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Minister responsible for the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, Mr. François Gendron, and the Member for Rouyn-Noranda-Témiscamingue, Mr. Gilles Chapadeau, are pleased to announce today the creation of the Land Drainage Support Program in Abitibi-Témiscamingue and Nord-du-Québec. The purpose of this program, worth a total of three million dollars, is to support agricultural businesses in the targeted regions in carrying out drainage works aimed at improving crop yields and developing land with potential. of recultivation.
Drainage of agricultural land will have specific beneficial results:
“The team of candidates from the Parti Québécois de l&#39;Abitibi-Témiscamingue made this commitment during the election campaign and it became a priority for me as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Abitibi-Témiscamingue has a large basin of land that offers interesting potential for the development of our agriculture. Currently, 24% of the land is drained in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, compared to 50% in Quebec as a whole. The region is lagging behind and, with this measure, we will be getting closer to the Quebec average, ”said Mr. Gendron.
The new program will be in effect for the next three years. Farm businesses can receive up to $ 50,000 for drainage work and the financial assistance they can take advantage of will cover up to 50% of eligible expenses related to the measures they have adopted.
“Abitibi-Témiscamingue is a still young region whose agricultural potential deserves to be exploited. The biofood industry already plays a considerable role in the regional economy. In 2011, some 8,500 direct jobs were attached to it, which is equivalent to 12% of all jobs in the region, ”concluded Mr. Chapadeau.
