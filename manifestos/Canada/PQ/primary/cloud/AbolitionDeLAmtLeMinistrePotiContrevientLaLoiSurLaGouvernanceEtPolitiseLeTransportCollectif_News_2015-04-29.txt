Quebec - The MP for Vachon and official opposition spokesperson for transport, Martine Ouellet, wonders about the intention of the Minister of Transport, Robert Poëti, to abolish the Agence métropolitaine de transport (AMT).
Indeed, the AMT would be abolished to be replaced by two new structures, the Regional Transport Agency (ART) and the Metropolitan Transport Network (RTM). However, the composition of the ART Board of Directors would violate the Corporate Governance Act, which requires that it be made up of two-thirds of independent members.
&quot;The multiplication of structures proposed by Minister Poëti would contravene the law and politicize public transport decisions in the metropolitan region,&quot; said Martine Ouellet.
In his fall 2013 report on AMT governance, the Auditor General of Quebec recommended that the number of independent members sitting on the board of directors be increased. This same report was analyzed last November by the Committee on Public Administration of the National Assembly. The first recommendation of his report echoed that of the Auditor General.
“The minister is going against a recommendation of the Auditor General and a decision of the Committee on Public Administration last November, yet voted by majority by elected Liberals. While Vancouver and Toronto are depoliticizing their public transit planning and management organizations as much as possible, in order to make room for experts in the field, the Liberal minister wants to politicize decisions. Worse still, the Minister is not even able to commit to ensuring that this multiplication of structures does not lead to an increase in tariffs for users, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
