Quebec - The MP for Vachon and official opposition critic for transport, Martine Ouellet, is concerned about the Liberal government&#39;s decision to abolish the Agence métropolitaine de transport (AMT) and replace it with two entities , namely the Metropolitan Transport Network and the Regional Transport Agency.
“This decision is really surprising. Indeed, while several cities in the world tend to centralize the planning and management of public transit around a single organization, the Liberal government decides to replace one structure with two structures. There are already too many players on this file; I don&#39;t see how creating a new organization and merging others will make it easier. For us, it is only a game of musical chairs between the speakers. The government has no real long-term vision for public transit in the metropolitan area, ”said Martine Ouellet.
In addition, the new configuration would give more power to the Montreal Metropolitan Community, which means more power for Montreal, but less to the cities on the outskirts. This new approach would further politicize public transit decisions in the greater metropolitan area.
“Once again, the Minister of Transport&#39;s decision runs counter to trends seen elsewhere in the world. In Vancouver and Toronto, for example, public transit planning and management organizations have been depoliticized as much as possible in order to leave room for experts in this field, thus ensuring long-term planning of the network. Not only is the liberal reorganization politicizing the decision-making process, but it also creates an obvious imbalance between Montreal and the other cities of the metropolitan region, ”concluded the Member.
