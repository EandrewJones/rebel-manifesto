Montreal - &quot;I am absolutely outraged to learn that the Conservative government is continuing its ideological offensive against Quebec in the area of culture, this time refusing to subsidize the Montreal International Literature Festival!&quot; Declared the member for Bourget and official opposition spokesperson for culture and communications, Maka Kotto.
“What will the Quebec Minister of Culture, Christine St-Pierre, do in the face of this new affront from the Conservative government towards Quebec culture, its artisans and its creators? Will she finally figure out what&#39;s going on and act on it? What more does he need? », Added Maka Kotto.
“By the very admission of its organizers, without this subsidy which represents 13% of the event&#39;s budget, the survival of the festival is now in jeopardy. This decision is all the more difficult to swallow as neither the officials nor the office of the Minister of Canadian Heritage, James Moore, deigned to explain the reasons for their choice to the organizers of the event. This is a purely ideological decision, ”said the deputy for Bourget.
“This Ottawa decision shows us once again that the Conservatives do not care about Quebec culture. Faced with them and a minister who has abdicated its responsibilities in this area, the Parti Québécois is the only party that proposes to act by repatriating, in particular to Quebec, all the powers and budgets in the field of culture and communications currently held. by Ottawa, ”concluded Maka Kotto.
