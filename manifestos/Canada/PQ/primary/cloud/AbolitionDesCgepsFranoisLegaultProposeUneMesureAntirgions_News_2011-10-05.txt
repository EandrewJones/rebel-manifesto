Quebec - The MNA for Taillon and official opposition spokesperson for higher education, Marie Malavoy, totally rejects François Legault&#39;s proposal to abolish CEGEPs.
&quot;By abolishing CEGEPs, François Legault wants to harm accessibility to studies and harm the regions of Quebec,&quot; said Marie Malavoy.
She deplores that Mr. Legault carries a prejudice to the effect that CEGEPs are places that encourage drug consumption and that in this case, they should be abolished.
“Above all, we must not trivialize this issue of drug use among our young people, but it is certainly not by abolishing CEGEPs that drugs will disappear! Now is not the time for the mixing of structures, but for the academic success of our children, ”she concluded.
