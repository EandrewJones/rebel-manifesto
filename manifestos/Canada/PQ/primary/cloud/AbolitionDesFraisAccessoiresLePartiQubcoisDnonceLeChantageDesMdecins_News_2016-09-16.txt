Quebec - The member for Taillon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of health and access to care, Diane Lamarre, denounced the threats brandished by the doctors, who will finally be forced to absorb the costs out of their remuneration accessories illegally billed to patients for insured services. &quot;We are outraged by the blackmail of doctors who threaten to stop treating people,&quot; she said first.
“Doctors are taking patients hostage by threatening to stop offering certain services. Gaétan Barrette himself, when he was president of a doctors&#39; union, has already used this tactic, moreover. This is unacceptable and unworthy of their fundamental duty to Quebeckers. The ancillary costs that they will have to stop charging illegally to patients may very well be covered from their remuneration, since this represents less than 1% of their annual budget of $ 7 billion. Do we need to remind doctors that they have received huge salary increases over the past 10 years, to the point not only of catching up with doctors in other provinces, but of overtaking them? », Continued the spokesperson.
“With the gigantic salary increases that doctors have had, it is indecent to do such blackmail. To listen to Ms. Francoeur, the president of the FMSQ, we should call Centraide to help them or organize a fundraiser. It&#39;s incredible! These threats from doctors are simply outrageous. Imagine: they dare to tell patients that they will have to stop treating them, on the pretext that they will no longer be able to take out of their pockets the millions they illegally billed them, ”concluded Diane Lamarre.
