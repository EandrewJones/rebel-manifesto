Montreal - The deputy and candidate of Gouin&#39;s Parti Québécois, Nicolas Girard, wonders about the position of the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) in terms of parliamentary ethics. &quot;We are pleased to note that the CAQ adheres to certain proposals of the Parti Québécois such as the fixed date ballot, the creation of the position of Parliamentary Budget Officer at the National Assembly and the reduction in funding to political parties to $ 100. However, it is strange to note that the CAQ is silent on our position concerning the cancellation of the pensions of deputies in the event of resignation during a mandate. Does this silence mean that the CAQ wants pensions to be maintained for those who resign, as is the case with the Liberals who favor the status quo in this file? Nicolas Girard wondered.
“The Parti Québécois believes that it is the responsibility of citizens to participate in democracy, in particular by voting massively, but in return, elected officials should have a moral obligation to complete their mandate. Otherwise, they should not be entitled to the same benefits as those who did, ”believes the member for Gouin.
“The silence of the CAQ gives the impression that this party is not concerned about the work ethic of the deputies, but only questions related to funding. For the Parti Québécois, the cleansing of our democracy must be done in all its aspects. François Legault must rectify this situation and take a stand, whether for or against our proposal, ”concluded Nicolas Girard.
