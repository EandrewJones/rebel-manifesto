Montreal - The Parti Québécois candidate in the Borduas riding, Pierre Duchesne, was indignant at the comments made on Twitter by an advisor to Liberal Minister Julie Boulet. “To draw parallels between the Parti Québécois and Nazism is frankly unacceptable. This is unacceptable for the Parti Québécois because we have always been a great democratic party concerned with respect between peoples, but above all it is an insult to all the victims of Nazism. &quot;
“Premier Jean Charest must apologize and dissociate himself from these comments. This is a major slippage. There is no place in the electoral campaign for such terrible accusations and such abject associations, he added, adding that Julie Boulet should crack down on her advisor. This type of slippage is a shame for those who commit them as well as for those who refuse to dissociate themselves from it. It is an insult to the Parti Québécois, its 90,000 members and the many Quebeckers who supported us and who still support us. There is simply no place for that in the political debate in Quebec. I think we are able to debate and have political disagreements without falling into such low level attacks. &quot;
