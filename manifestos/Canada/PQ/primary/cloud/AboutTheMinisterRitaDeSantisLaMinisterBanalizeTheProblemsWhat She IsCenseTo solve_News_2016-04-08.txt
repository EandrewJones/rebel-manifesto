Quebec - Reacting to the comments of Minister Rita de Santis, who declared that the target of $ 150,000 imposed on Liberal ministers in 2008 and 2009 was “peanuts”, the House leader of the official opposition, Bernard Drainville, denounces that the minister responsible for the reform of democratic institutions is trivializing the liberal system of political financing. “This system has given tremendous power to liberal fundraisers. He gave Liberal funding money toxic power over our democracy. A power of corruption, ”he said.
“His role, as minister responsible for the reform of democratic institutions, is to clean up political mores. By her words, Rita de Santis trivializes the problems that she should work to resolve, ”added Bernard Drainville.
This position taken by Minister de Santis comes at a time when, for several weeks, the Prime Minister has persisted in refusing to condemn the system of liberal ministers to $ 100,000 and the super-ministers of liberal funding to $ 150,000. Yesterday, in the National Assembly, Minister de Santis and all elected members of the Liberal Party joined forces with Philippe Couillard in refusing to adopt a motion condemning this system, presented by the leader of the official opposition.
“The minister, who should be the guardian of our democratic institutions, must absolutely condemn the system of ministers at $ 100,000 and super ministers at $ 150,000. Again this morning in arraignment, I asked her to condemn him and she refused to do so. How can the minister responsible for strengthening our institutions defend the liberal system, a system that has led to UPAC investigations and criminal charges? », Concluded Bernard Drainville.
