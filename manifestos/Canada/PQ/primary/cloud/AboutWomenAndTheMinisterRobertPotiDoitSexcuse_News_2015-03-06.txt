Quebec - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, asks Minister Robert Poëti to apologize for the sexist and inappropriate comments he made on Tuesday at the Baie-des-Chaleurs Chamber of Commerce.
Deploring that he would not have time to show the guests of the Gaspé gastronomic supper taking place in Montreal later this year, the minister added that the spouses were invited, the metropolis having many “shopping centers”. &quot;. Women, according to the minister, have nothing better to do than shop while their husbands are working?
“I add my voice to those of the businesswomen present on Tuesday, who found the minister&#39;s words reductive and unimpressive. It is all the more offensive and inappropriate as these sexist remarks were made on the eve of International Women&#39;s Day, on the platform of the Baie-des-Chaleurs Chamber of Commerce, of which 30% of the members are women. », Declared Carole Poirier.
“Such a speech is unworthy of a member of the government, who should rather be a model. Obviously, despite all the struggles, efforts still need to be made to fully enhance the role of women in our society. The minister must immediately apologize for his unacceptable remarks, ”she concluded.
