Quebec - The Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, makes the victims of 3 new municipalities eligible for financial assistance following the train accident that occurred on July 6, 2013 in the town of Lac-Mégantic. In total, it is now the victims of 18 municipalities who can benefit from the specific financial assistance program for this event.
