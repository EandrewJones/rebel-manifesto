Quebec - Almost four weeks after the train accident in Lac-Mégantic, the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks (MDDEFP) wishes to take stock of the work in progress along the Chaudière River.
The Department hardly observes any traces of hydrocarbons on the surface of the water. On the other hand, as a preventive measure, the numerous booms, which serve as floating booms, are kept in place in order to recover any quantity of oil that may be released during the recovery work.
In addition, the Department continues to monitor the quality of the river&#39;s water in order to provide adequate advice to municipalities that must draw water from alternative water intakes, namely Saint-Georges, Sainte-Marie and Lévis. Only traces of contaminants are detected, and analyzes will continue until the use of this water no longer presents a health risk.
In addition, the MDDEFP is continuing to check the condition of the banks. To date, more than 100 kilometers have been assessed out of a total of 180. This assessment helps direct clean-up teams to areas where the banks have been soiled. Indeed, many teams are busy cleaning the banks already assessed. Currently, more than sixty people are responsible for doing this work.
Finally, it should be noted that the preliminary verifications made by the Department lead to the conclusion that oil would have deposited in part of the bottom of the Chaudière River. Scientists from the MDDEFP and the Ministry of Natural Resources will act together to analyze the results obtained following the verifications carried out in the field. They will also formulate opinions on the consequences of this contamination, on the areas requiring intervention and on the cleaning methods to be adopted.
Thus, all the necessary work is done to clean this watercourse which has its source in Lake Mégantic. All the required staff and equipment are put to work in order to achieve the best results as quickly as possible.
