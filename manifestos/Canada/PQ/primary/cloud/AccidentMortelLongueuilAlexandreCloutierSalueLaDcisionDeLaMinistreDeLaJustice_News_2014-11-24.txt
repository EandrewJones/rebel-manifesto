Quebec - The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for justice, Alexandre Cloutier, is delighted that the Minister of Justice, Stéphanie Vallée, has finally decided to entrust the assessment of the case of the fatal accident involving a Sûreté du Québec police officer to independent prosecutors.
&quot;It is a good decision which, it is hoped, will help preserve the public&#39;s confidence in our justice system. It was essential that an external eye look into the file, in particular because of the many messes which characterized it, declared Alexandre Cloutier, who called for such an intervention of the minister since last week.
The deputy offers all his cooperation and that of his political party regarding the legislative changes to come concerning the Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions (DPCP) and his independence.
Alexandre Cloutier wants in particular that from now on, when a police officer is involved in a serious or fatal accident and no charges are brought against him, the DPCP systematically justifies the reasons for its decision. &quot;We must absolutely prevent a situation like this, where parents have to fight with the system to obtain simple explanations, from recurring in the future,&quot; concluded the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
