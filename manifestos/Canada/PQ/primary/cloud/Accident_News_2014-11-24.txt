Quebec - Following the press conference last Friday by the Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions (DPCP) regarding the fatal accident in Longueuil involving a police officer from the Sûreté du Québec (SQ), the member for Lac-Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for justice, Alexandre Cloutier, once again demands that the Minister of Justice, Stéphanie Vallée, order the file to be reviewed by an independent prosecutor.
“Now that she has the version of the DPCP and that the Prime Minister has not ruled out reviewing the file, will Minister Vallée act? Important questions are being raised, and the DPCP press conference has provided further evidence that the intervention of an independent prosecutor is necessary to review the case. The credibility of the judicial system is at stake, ”said Alexandre Cloutier.
The member recalls that last Wednesday, based on sections 23 and 24 of the Act respecting the Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions, the official opposition personally challenged the Minister on this matter, asking her to intervene.
“There have been several boondoggles in this matter. First, the DPCP did not inform the parents of its decision on the criminal prosecution; it was the SQ investigators who did it. Then the parents were forced to go out publicly in order to get answers. The DPCP then took several days to finally meet them. And, this morning, the main eyewitness bluntly contradicts the DPCP on the responsibility of the police officer. It is therefore clearly time for an independent review to be carried out, ”concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
