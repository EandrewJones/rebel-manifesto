Saint-Jean-Port-Joli– The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, announces an agreement in principle of more than $ 2 million for the capital project of the organization Est-Nord-Est, residence of artists.
“In Saint-Jean-Port-Joli there is a natural atmosphere conducive to creation and cultural innovation. Art and culture lovers and artists even come from abroad to draw inspiration and creativity. Ultimately, the entire community of artists in visual arts, crafts and media arts as well as the general population could benefit from the investments made within the framework of the East-North-East project: tout azimut! », Declared Minister Maka Kotto.
This agreement in principle will allow the Est-Nord-Est organization, artist residency, to carry out additional studies and finalize the definition and planning of the project. This is intended to provide the organization with the infrastructure and equipment essential to the full realization of its production residency mandate, ie a functional place all year round.
The amount provided for under the agreement in principle is $ 2,169,000, or 90% of the total estimated cost. It is made possible thanks to the Capital Assistance program of the Ministry of Culture and Communications. The Est-Nord-Est, artist residency organization will contribute to the project thanks to a reserve of $ 200,000 accumulated in particular within the framework of the Mécénat Placements Culture program of the Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec. The Municipality of Saint-Jean-Port-Joli is also a partner for an amount of $ 40,000.
The Department&#39;s financial support is part of the 2013-2023 Quebec Infrastructure Plan, made public last April. It should be remembered that this ten-year plan will ultimately result in investments of $ 2 billion for the cultural component. It will have a major economic impact throughout Quebec, with nearly 60,000 jobs created or maintained, on average, per year.
