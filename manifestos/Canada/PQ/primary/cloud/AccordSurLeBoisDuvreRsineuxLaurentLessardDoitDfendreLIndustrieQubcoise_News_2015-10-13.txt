Quebec - The Softwood Lumber Agreement between Canada and the United States ended yesterday. Consequently, the Quebec market is now entering a period of free trade for one year, pending a possible renegotiation. It is in this context that the member for Bonaventure and the Parti Québécois spokesperson for forests, Sylvain Roy, calls on the Minister of Forests, Laurent Lessard, to defend the Quebec lumber industry.
“The Quebec forest economy cannot afford a new lumber war. The beginning of the transition year represents a period of uncertainty for the industry. Minister Lessard must reassure workers, who risk suffering from market instability. It also has a duty to put pressure on the competitiveness of the new forestry regime to be recognized and thus avoid the introduction of tariffs by the Americans, ”declared Sylvain Roy.
It should be noted, moreover, that negotiations with a view to renewing the Agreement have not even begun with the United States. “Laurent Lessard must ensure that the Government of Canada quickly begins negotiations with the Americans to renew the Accord. It must also ensure that the federal government takes into account the needs of Quebec exporters. Before the 2006 agreement, small exporters from Quebec had to leave the market because of taxes and quotas imposed by the Americans. This situation must not happen again, ”concluded the deputy.
