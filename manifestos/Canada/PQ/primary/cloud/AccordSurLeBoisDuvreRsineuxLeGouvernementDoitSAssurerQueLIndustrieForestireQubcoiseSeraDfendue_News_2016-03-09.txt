Quebec– The Parti Québécois spokesperson for forests, Sylvain Roy, as well as the spokesperson for municipal affairs and decentralization, and responsible for the Saguenay – Lac-Saint-Jean region, Sylvain Gaudreault, ask the government of Philippe Couillard to insist with the federal government that the position of the Quebec forest industry be defended during the negotiation of a new softwood lumber agreement with the United States.
“The previous agreement was much more favorable for Western Canada than for Quebec. When conflicts have arisen, the federal government has always refused to work in the interests of Quebec industry, and it is our workers and our regions who have suffered, ”Sylvain Roy reminded us.
He also pointed out that the Softwood Lumber Agreement expired in October 2015. “The Government of Quebec must constantly press the federal government, since it is Canada that will negotiate on our behalf. The statements of the federal Minister of International Trade, Chrystia Freeland, worry, because she does not seem to want to defend the Quebec industry, yet hit hard more than once. Let us remember that the taxes on supercalendered paper and the other charges arising from the Accord have caused the loss of jobs in Quebec, ”he added.
As for Sylvain Gaudreault, he wanted to defend workers in the Saguenay – Lac-Saint-Jean region. “Yesterday morning, the workers let out a cry from the heart. According to them, the regional forest industry will soon be terminated if nothing is done. I ask the Prime Minister, Member of Parliament for Roberval, to give an electric shock to help this industry which is so important for our regions. The budget will be tabled next week; it must include a strong will and concrete measures for our forest workers who have lost their jobs or who are in a precarious situation, ”he concluded.
