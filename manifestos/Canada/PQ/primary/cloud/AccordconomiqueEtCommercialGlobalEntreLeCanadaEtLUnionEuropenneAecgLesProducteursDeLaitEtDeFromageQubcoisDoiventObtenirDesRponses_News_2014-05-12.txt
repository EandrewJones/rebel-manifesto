Quebec - While the possibility of an outcome in the compensation file for our milk and cheese producers seems to be taking shape, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Paradis, must give them answers, say the official opposition spokespersons for agriculture, André Villeneuve, and finance, Nicolas Marceau. They also say that the Liberal government must commit not to ratify CETA if there is no agreement between Ottawa and the milk and cheese producers on fair compensation.
“The government must set the record straight for those awaiting the conclusion of negotiations with the federal government. Can the minister confirm that there is an agreement and, if so, specify what the terms are? It is rather worrying that the minister himself cannot confirm the outcome of the discussions, ”declared the deputy for Berthier, André Villeneuve.
Remember that according to CETA, more than 17,000 additional tonnes of European cheese could enter the Canadian and Quebec markets. The shortfall of Quebec producers must be compensated and the entry of European cheese into the market spread over time.
“The economic and trade agreement will allow Quebec to position itself as a leading partner and to combine its efforts to increase the export of Quebec companies. The cheese issue remains very important, however; the government must not ask parliamentarians of the National Assembly to ratify CETA without there being a satisfactory agreement for our milk and cheese producers, ”concluded the member for Rousseau, Nicolas Marceau.
