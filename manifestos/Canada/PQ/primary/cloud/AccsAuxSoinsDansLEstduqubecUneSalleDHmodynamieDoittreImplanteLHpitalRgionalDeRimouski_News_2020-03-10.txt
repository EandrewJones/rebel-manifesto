Québec, March 10, 2020 - The member for Rimouski, Harold LeBel, as well as the members for Eastern Quebec, accompanied by elected officials, citizens and members of the medical profession of the region, launched a cry of Heart to the Minister of Health and Social Services, Danielle McCann: for the citizens of Eastern Quebec to be adequately and equitably served, a hemodynamic room must be set up at the Center hospitalier régional de Rimouski.
IN SHORT
Hemodynamics is a technique used to unblock the arteries of the heart in the event of a heart attack, thus limiting the damage. “Each year, more than 1,400 patients in Eastern Quebec use this type of care. To do this, they must go to Quebec. Some, too unstable, die during the transfer; others will live with permanent sequelae, due to the delays in intervention. And for all patients, this is an untenable and unfair situation. While seven regions of Quebec benefit from a hemodynamic service, patients in Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspésie are confronted with stress, distance and discomfort. The government must step in, ”said Harold LeBel.
It should be noted that on several occasions, a committee made up of cardiologists and citizens has proven that the region meets all the conditions for obtaining a hemodynamic service. Numerous reports and files presented to the Ministry of Health and Social Services (MSSS) demonstrate this.
“The CAQ often affirms that the regions have an important role to play in the development and prosperity of Quebec. However, to occupy the territory, adequate health services must be offered in all regions. In Eastern Quebec, there is consensus: we need a hemodynamic room. It is a question of equity for the population, and the government must take it into account, ”insisted the deputy.
