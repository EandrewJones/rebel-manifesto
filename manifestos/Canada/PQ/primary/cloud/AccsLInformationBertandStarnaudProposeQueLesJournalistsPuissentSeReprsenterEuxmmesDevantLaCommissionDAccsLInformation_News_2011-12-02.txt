Quebec - The member for Chambly and spokesperson for the official opposition in matters of access to information, Bertrand St-Arnaud, this morning tabled in the National Assembly Bill 590, the object of which is to exclude the obligation to be represented by a lawyer before the Access to Information Commission. The purpose of this bill is to add the Access to Information Commission to the exceptions already provided for in the Act respecting the Barreau du Québec. This amendment to the law will allow journalists in particular to represent themselves before the Access to Information Commission.
Almost 30 years ago, Quebec adopted a law on access to information which guarantees that everyone has a right of access to documents of a public body under the conditions provided for by the law. &quot;There can not be two categories of persons before the Access to Information Commission and the intention of the legislator has always been to allow any person to ask the commission to review a decision of a public body and represent itself. The law must facilitate the right of access and not limit it ”, affirmed the deputy.
&quot;I invite the government to adopt this bill by the end of parliamentary proceedings, on December 9,&quot; concluded the deputy.
