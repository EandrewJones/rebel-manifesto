Quebec - The member for Chambly and official opposition critic for access to information, Bertrand St-Arnaud, spoke this morning during question period in the National Assembly to demand from the Liberal government a amendment to the law allowing journalists to represent themselves before the Access to Information Commission.
“The current situation does not make sense. A journalist, unlike a private citizen, cannot even present himself / herself when requesting a review from the Access to Information Commission. He must absolutely be represented by a lawyer. The result is a slowing down of the process and numerous costs which lead many journalists to abandon their request for review, thus depriving the public of their right to information. It is totally absurd and contrary to the spirit of the law. This is absurd and this situation must end quickly! », Affirmed the deputy.
“30 years ago, Quebec adopted an access to information law that guarantees a fundamental right: access to documents held by public bodies. The modification that we are requesting is quite simple, the Access to Information Commission must be included in cases where legal representation is not compulsory. There cannot be two categories of citizens before the Access to Information Commission, the ordinary citizen and the journalist, ”he continued.
“Minister Vallières&#39; response to my question is inadmissible. It postpones for several years the resolution of a situation clearly contrary to the spirit of the law, which is supposed to promote access to documents, not limit it. We cannot wait for the next reform of the Act respecting access to documents held by public bodies and the protection of personal information to act, ”added Bertrand St-Arnaud.
“There is an urgent need to change the law. The government can count on our full cooperation to put an end to this drift before the adjournment of parliamentary proceedings on December 9, ”concluded the deputy.
