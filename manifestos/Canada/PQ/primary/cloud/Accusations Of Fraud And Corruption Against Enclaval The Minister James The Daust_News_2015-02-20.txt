Québec– The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for justice, Alexandre Cloutier, as well as the member for Saint-Jérôme and spokesperson for the economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, ask the Minister of the Economy, Jacques Daoust, not to interfere in the legal process concerning SNC-Lavalin.
“By his words, Jacques Daoust exceeded the limit; he does not have to lead the police or the attorney general. There is a difference between the reimbursement of the sums with Bill 26 and the criminal charges laid yesterday for fraud and corruption. Bill 26 allows firms to settle in civil matters, when criminal charges are much more serious; the minister knows it very well! “, Said Alexandre Cloutier.
“Minister Daoust, by saying that the law must be at two speeds, sends a message very heavy with consequences. It is unacceptable that he suggests that a business should be able to buy a full civil release and avoid criminal prosecution. If criminal acts have been committed, charges must be laid. We remind Jacques Daoust that this is the prerogative of the Attorney General. The minister must explain himself immediately, ”added the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
&quot;Jacques Daoust, rather than commenting on the work of prosecutors and the police, should focus on what he will do to support the activities of SNC-Lavalin&#39;s head office and its 5,000 employees,&quot; concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
