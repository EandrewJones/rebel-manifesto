Quebec - The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, welcomes the adoption, on today&#39;s date, of Bill 65 facilitating the replacement and reconstitution of the notaries&#39; registries destroyed in Lac- Mégantic on July 6.
“With the adoption of this bill, we will have a streamlined and diversified procedure for replacing and reconstituting documents, to meet the needs of our fellow citizens of Lac-Mégantic. It will allow us to avoid going to court to replace and reconstitute each of the acts, which would have unnecessarily clogged our justice system and would have been contrary to the public interest ”, specified Minister Bertrand St-Arnaud.
Remember that 12 transplants were destroyed following the train tragedy of July 6, resulting in the loss of nearly 100,000 notarial deeds: marriage contracts, wills, mandates in case of incapacity, mortgage deeds, purchase deeds. or sale of property, etc.
Thanks to the adoption of Bill 65, new, more flexible rules will ensure that the documents destroyed in Lac-Mégantic can be replaced by the insertion in the office of an authentic copy having the value of an original. In cases where the replacement will not be possible, the notary may proceed to its reconstitution, but only following a request from a party or an interested third party.
The Chambre des notaires du Québec will coordinate this operation on the ground and will ensure that the population of the region is made aware of this.
