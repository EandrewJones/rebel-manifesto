Quebec - Following the statements by Philippe Couillard, made today to the Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, the member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, asks the Liberal leader to tell Quebecers under what conditions he would be ready to sign the Canadian Constitution.
“The Prime Minister must undertake to make known as quickly as possible the conditions of Quebec to reinstate the Constitution, its timetable, and when he intends to consult the population on this important question. If he wishes to take such a step, he has an obligation of transparency, ”declared Stéphane Bédard.
The leader of the official opposition also recalled that all the reforms of the Canadian federation which respected Quebec&#39;s minimum demands have never been successful.
The member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, for his part affirms that the Prime Minister has just once again demonstrated that he wants Quebec to be a province like others.
“We must fear that Philippe Couillard, undoubtedly the most Canadian of all the premiers that Quebec has known, will sell Quebec&#39;s adherence to the Canadian Constitution at a discount. While he is clarifying his approach and waiting for him to answer our questions, the Prime Minister must seriously defend the interests of Quebec vis-à-vis Ottawa, whether it be on the fiscal imbalance, the reduction in federal health transfers or funding. infrastructures. Today, he lost a good opportunity to assert Quebec&#39;s interests to Stephen Harper, ”concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
