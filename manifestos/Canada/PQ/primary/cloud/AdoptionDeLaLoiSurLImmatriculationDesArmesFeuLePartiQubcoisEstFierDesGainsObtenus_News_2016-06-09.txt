Quebec - The Chief Whip of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bergeron, and the Parti Québécois spokesperson for forests, wildlife and parks, Sylvain Roy, are delighted with the work accomplished by the Parti Québécois team in the National Assembly to pass Bill 64, Firearms Registration Act.
“The Firearms Registration Act is an important measure to improve the safety of Quebeckers. I am proud to have contributed to its adoption. I would like to salute the work of the various stakeholders who came to demand the registration of weapons, particularly that of the PolySeSouvient group and the Coalition for the control of weapons. Their testimonies once again demonstrated to us the need to register weapons, ”said Stéphane Bergeron.
The Parti Québécois is also proud of the gains made during the clause-by-clause study of the bill, aimed at simplifying the process for law-abiding gun owners and hunters.
&quot;We are satisfied to have obtained three major gains for hunters, namely the inclusion, in the bill, that no tariff can be charged for the registration of a weapon, the withdrawal of the power of seizure by wildlife officers, and the reduction of fines for the minor offense of not having your registration paper in hand, ”concluded Sylvain Roy.
