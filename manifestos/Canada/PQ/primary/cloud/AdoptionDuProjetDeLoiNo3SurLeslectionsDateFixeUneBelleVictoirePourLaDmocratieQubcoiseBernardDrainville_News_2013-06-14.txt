Quebec - The time when the date of the elections was fixed according to the interests of the party in power is now a thing of the past: the bill on fixed-date elections was finally adopted today, unanimously, by the deputies of the National Assembly. The Minister responsible for Democratic Institutions and Citizen Participation welcomed its adoption. &quot;This is a great victory for Quebeckers and for our democracy,&quot; said the Minister. After more than six months of discussions, negotiations, negotiations between all the parties in the Assembly, we have once again succeeded in gaining the unanimity of all the parties on a bill aimed at giving Quebecers their elections back. &quot;
Let us recall that the government has already tabled and unanimously passed two other bills of democratic integrity: Bill No. 2 on the financing of political parties and Bill No. 13 on voting on campuses.
