Montreal - The spokesperson for Québec solidaire, Françoise David, today published on her blog a real lawsuit against the Parti Québécois without even having done the minimum checks required by any intervention by a party leader. Here is the response that the president of the national executive council of the Parti Québécois, Raymond Archambault, sent at 4:19 pm on the blog of the spokesperson for Québec solidaire. At 5:45 p.m., Québec solidaire had still not deigned to publish Raymond Archambault&#39;s response.
