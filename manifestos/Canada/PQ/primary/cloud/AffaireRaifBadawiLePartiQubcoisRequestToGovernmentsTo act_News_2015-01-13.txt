Quebec - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for international relations and Francophonie, Carole Poirier, calls on the governments of Quebec and Ottawa to act and intervene with the Saudi authorities to put an end to the barbaric torments inflicted on blogger Raif Badawi, imprisoned in Jeddah since June 2012. Today, during a press briefing, she has also added her voice to that of Amnesty International Canada francophone to demand his release.
“Mr. Badawi is being tortured because his opinions displeased the Saudi authorities, and the governments of Quebec and Canada are not reacting. Why? I ask the Minister of International Relations, Christine St-Pierre, to quickly put pressure on her federal counterpart, John Baird, so that an intervention can take place. The blogger&#39;s family living here in Quebec, it is the Minister&#39;s duty to do everything possible to put an end to this despicable violation of human rights, ”declared Carole Poirier.
“For the past few days, all political actors, including the governments of Quebec and Canada, have constantly reaffirmed the importance of freedom of expression and freedom of the press. However, Raif Badawi is precisely imprisoned for comments he made on the Internet. The only reaction of the federal government was to issue a press release through the Office of Religious Freedom of Canada. The governments of Canada and Quebec may well make beautiful statements in the wind to generate good press, but this still has to be illustrated in reality! », Concluded the member.
