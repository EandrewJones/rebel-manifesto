Québec, March 1, 2017 - In reaction to the dramatic drop in the number of wildlife protection officers under the Liberals, the member for Bonaventure and Parti Québécois spokesperson for forests, wildlife and parks, Sylvain Roy, asks the Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, Luc Blanchette, to finally take action and increase the number of agents in the territory.
Last spring, the Sustainable Development Commissioner tabled a devastating report on wildlife management in Quebec. Its conclusions are damning, especially with regard to the decline in the number of wildlife officers, which compromises the protection of wildlife and the safety of citizens. “We went from 426 wildlife officers in 2011 to 374 in 2016, 25% of whom work part time. This is an unacceptable drop in the workforce that endangers the sustainability of the entire sector, ”Sylvain Roy said at a press briefing, alongside members of the Union of Quebec Wildlife Protection Agents.
No action in eight months
“Eight months and two ministers later, nothing. No action to correct deficiencies. The government has abandoned the sector. The increase in poaching and intimidating behavior in the forest to monopolize the territories, the deterioration in the quality of the experience for the next generation, the inadequate protection of wildlife habitat, the many abandoned files, all of this tends to demonstrate ”, also denounced the deputy.
&quot;Our request to the Minister is clear: he must rehire wildlife officers to signal Quebecers that the State is assuming its responsibilities for the protection of one of the greatest collective heritages in Quebec,&quot; concluded Sylvain Roy.
It should be remembered that there are nearly 712,000 fishermen who spend an average of 13 days per year on the bodies of water in Quebec, and that 285,000 hunters go on average 15 days per year in the forest. The economic spinoffs related to the wildlife sector are in the order of $ 1.6 billion.
