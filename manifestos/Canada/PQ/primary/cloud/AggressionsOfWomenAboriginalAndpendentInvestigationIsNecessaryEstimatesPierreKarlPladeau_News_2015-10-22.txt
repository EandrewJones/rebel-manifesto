Quebec - Faced with the scale of the revelations about possible sexual assaults against Indigenous women, allegedly committed by police officers from the Sûreté du Québec in Val-d&#39;Or, the leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, demands that the Liberal government initiate a transparent and independent investigation of the police forces.
“Currently, the eight investigations targeting Sûreté du Québec police officers are being carried out by the Sûreté du Québec. This is unacceptable. To be transparent and regain the confidence of the population, it is obviously necessary for the government in this case to order an independent investigation, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“Native women have allegedly been repeatedly sexually abused by eight individuals, in this case the police, or people in a position of authority. This is a very serious matter and it is necessary to be transparent. How is it that the government has not yet understood that the police investigating the police no longer apply to the people of Quebec? Added the leader of the Parti Québécois.
It was last spring that the Minister of Public Security, Lise Thériault, was made aware that serious sexual crimes had been committed against aboriginal women on numerous occasions. &quot;Faced with this situation, what did the Deputy Prime Minister do? She decided to treat her like it was a trivial matter. What a lack of judgment! », Continued Pierre Karl Péladeau.
Office of Independent Investigations
Bill 12, passed under a Parti Québécois government, created the Independent Investigations Office, which can be mandated by the Minister &quot;to investigate any event involving a peace officer&quot;. &quot;What is this government waiting for to bring this law into force and entrust the Bureau des inquiries independent to the investigation of the Sûreté du Québec police officers who allegedly assaulted Native women?&quot; », Concluded the leader of the official opposition.
