Quebec City, December 2, 2016 - Parti Québécois finance spokesperson Nicolas Marceau and economic spokesperson Alain Therrien denounce the Liberal Party&#39;s attempt to take credit for the drop in the unemployment rate in Quebec, whereas it is more the result of a simple drop in the participation rate. “While employment has stagnated in Quebec and the number of full-time jobs has declined for six months, the Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, and the Minister of the Economy, Dominique Anglade, are pleased to see the aging of people bring down the unemployment rate, ”they said.
“We already knew that the Liberals were ready to say anything to hide their economic shortcomings, but from there to congratulate themselves because fewer people can and want to work in Quebec, it&#39;s ridiculous. Since the Liberals were elected, the workforce has shrunk, so fewer workers are looking for jobs. In November 2003, the activity rate stood at 66.5%; it is currently at 64.5%. If this rate had simply been maintained, nearly 140,000 more people would be available to work in Quebec. The unemployment rate is low because there are fewer workers and more retirees in Quebec. It&#39;s a simple question of demography, ”explained Nicolas Marceau.
“The only thing the Liberals have found to console themselves is the unemployment rate, as economic growth slows and exports decline, as does investment. While the government takes credit for the positive effects of demographic changes, factories are closing and Minister Anglade watches the train go by. Again this week, we learned that nearly 500 jobs will soon disappear in the manufacturing sector, due to the announced closure of the Mondelez plant in Montreal. Philippe Couillard&#39;s promise to create 250,000 jobs is further than ever from reality, ”concluded Alain Therrien.
