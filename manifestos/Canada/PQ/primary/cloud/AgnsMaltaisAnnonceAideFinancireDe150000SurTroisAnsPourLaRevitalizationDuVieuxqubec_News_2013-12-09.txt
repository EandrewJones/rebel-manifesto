This work will make it possible to set up promising economic, social and heritage projects that will consolidate the vitality of this incomparable living environment in the heart of my riding, a cultural jewel of UNESCO&#39;s world heritage ”, underlined Ms. Maltais.
The Table de concertation du Vieux-Québec was created in the wake of the Estates General of Old Quebec in 2012.

Chaired by Ms. Julie Lemieux, municipal councilor, the Table brings together 18 representatives of organizations, institutions, associations of traders and citizens, as well as three elected municipal officials.
The Secretariat, attached to the Minister of the Executive Council, advises the government and the Minister responsible for the Capitale-Nationale, Ms. Agnès Maltais, on any question or measure having a significant impact on the region and on its economic, cultural, tourist and social development. . The Secretariat acts in concert with its various governmental and regional partners, while financially supporting the realization of projects contributing to the growth of the Capitale-Nationale.
