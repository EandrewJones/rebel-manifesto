Montreal? The Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, and the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Sylvain Gaudreault, today announced the addition of an amount of $ 20,213,782 to build a road in Salluit and to provide municipal services to 500 housing units in the territory of Nunavik.
&quot;The consequences of climate change and soil instability in Nunavik, particularly in the village of Salluit, are leading the Government of Quebec to make major investments to ensure the implementation of measures that will concretely help the affected populations&quot; , argued the Prime Minister.
The main measure included in this capital budget is the construction of a municipal road leading to a new sector, south of the village of Salluit. Access to this location is essential for the realization of the intervention scenario which aims to promote development on land suitable for construction.
The other measure, provided for in the 2012-2013 budget, aims to provide 500 new homes with drinking water, wastewater treatment and garbage collection. To do this, $ 11,198,800 will be invested in the territory of Nunavik for municipal infrastructure and equipment.
“Due to the considerable stakes at the heart of this file and the investments deemed essential for the population of Salluit, the government of Quebec had to intervene to ensure well-ordered development on suitable soils. The objective is of course to improve the quality of life of the communities living in the territory of Nunavik, ”declared Minister Gaudreault.
Remember that on April 29, 2011, the Kativik Regional Administration and the Government of Quebec signed a five-year agreement of $ 82,300,000 to provide the 14 northern villages with infrastructure and equipment to improve municipal drinking water services, wastewater, waste collection and roadways.
