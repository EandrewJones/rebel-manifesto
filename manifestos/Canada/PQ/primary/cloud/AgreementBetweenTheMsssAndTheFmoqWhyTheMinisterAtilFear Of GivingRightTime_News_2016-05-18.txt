Quebec– Diane Lamarre, Member of Parliament for Taillon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of health and access to care, deplores the lack of transparency of the Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette, in terms of monitoring the targets set in the agreement it entered into with the FMOQ to avoid the application of Bill 20.
“What we learned recently is that despite the return of the Bolduc bonus and the other registration bonuses granted to physicians in the agreement with the FMOQ, almost a year ago to the day, the targets fixed will be missed. In fact, in a press release sent to its members and published on the Web, the president of the FMOQ confirmed, a few days ago, that the planned targets, that is to say that 85% of the population is registered for a family doctor by 2018, will hardly be reached, since there are still a million orphan patients, ”said Diane Lamarre.
“Quarterly reports had to be produced in order to monitor the progress of patient care. However, despite our repeated requests, Minister Barrette refuses to make them public. If his agreement were so good, he would not hide the results ... These reports should give us the true picture as to the attendance rate of physicians, but, on this too, the minister refuses to transmit the information to parliamentarians and citizens. Why? Added the spokesperson.
“The agreement the Minister has reached with the FMOQ is an announced failure, and Bill 20 is not a more acceptable solution for physicians than for patients. The Parti Québécois believes that frontline work and patient care should not rest solely on the shoulders of doctors. It is high time to use the skills of other health professionals, to develop solutions that take the patient first into account, ”concluded the MP.
