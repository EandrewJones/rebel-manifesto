Quebec - The Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau, and the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, wish to recall that the amount provided for by the government for the reimbursement of the QST to municipalities will increase from $ 472 million in 2013 to $ 482 million in 2014. “At the request of municipal organizations, we agreed to extend the Agreement on a new fiscal partnership and financial year, the time to complete the negotiation of a new agreement. There is no question of reducing the amounts transferred to municipalities, ”said Minister Marceau.
In addition, the municipalities were informed by the previous government that under the QST-GST Harmonization Agreement, the regime that will apply in Quebec from 2014 will be similar to the GST rebate regime. Concretely, the municipalities will be reimbursed based on the amounts actually paid, and not on an estimated amount, as is currently the case. To comply with the best accounting rules, municipalities must therefore review certain practices.
“Let&#39;s be clear: there are no surprises for municipalities. The rules relating to the harmonization of taxes have been known since March 2012 and had been communicated to municipal organizations by the Liberal government. I am convinced that the municipalities are pursuing the objective of implementing best practices as much as we do, ”concluded Minister Gaudreault.
