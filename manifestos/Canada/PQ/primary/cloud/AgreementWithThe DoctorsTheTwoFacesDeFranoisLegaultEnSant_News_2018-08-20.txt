The member for Taillon, Diane Lamarre, the Parti Québécois candidate in Taschereau, Diane Lavallée, and the candidate in Repentigny, Dr. Éric Tremblay, denounce the double speech of the head of the CAQ, François Legault. “On the one hand, he makes a commitment to Quebecers to review the remuneration of physicians; on the other, he seduces candidates by promising not to reopen the agreement with medical specialists. François Legault is not serious! », Summarized Diane Lamarre.
IN SHORT
“Last Saturday, we learned that François Legault, in the hope of seducing a possible candidate, gave in: finally, he would not reopen the agreement with medical specialists, even if it meant withdrawing from his financial framework all the measures that would have been financed from the sums he intended to fetch from the pockets of doctors, so many promises made to Quebecers in recent months, ”continued the Member for Taillon.
“There are not two truths: depending on the person to whom it is addressed, François Legault speaks from both sides of the mouth, quite simply. We now understand that his beautiful promises were nothing but wind, that he was never serious when he said he wanted to review the remuneration of doctors. How could Quebeckers trust a man with so little credibility, who says one thing and its opposite, depending on the context? “, Added Diane Lavallée.
“Unlike the head of the CAQ, we in the Parti Québécois are serious when we commit to reopening the agreement with doctors. The health system needs more nurses, more patient attendants, more professional resources to better care for people. Many physicians also consider that they are sufficiently paid, and that increasing their remuneration is not the way to improve care for the population, ”said Éric Tremblay, initiator of the physician movement. who demand the cancellation of their salary increases.
