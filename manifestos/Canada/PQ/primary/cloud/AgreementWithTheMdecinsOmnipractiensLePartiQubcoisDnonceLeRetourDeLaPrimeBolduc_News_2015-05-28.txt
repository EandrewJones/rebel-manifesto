Quebec - Diane Lamarre, the MNA for Taillon and official opposition spokesperson for health and access to care, denounces the return of the “Bolduc bonus” in the agreement between the government and the Fédération des general practitioners of Quebec (FMOQ), released yesterday.
“All Quebecers remember it: the government had undertaken to abolish this aberration which was the“ Bolduc premium ”. He had even included it in Bill 20. However, we discover, in point 24 of the agreement, that the premium is back for the registration of orphan patients. Now, we better understand how the Minister of Health was able to reach an agreement with the doctors, and why we were slow to reveal the details, ”said Diane Lamarre.
In the House, the spokesperson insisted on knowing whether the President of the Conseil du trésor had given his approval to this approach. “Has he exceptionally untied the purse strings for his colleague in Health, while he demands sacrifices from all other actors in the public sector? It would be completely insane, ”she argued.
In response to the MP&#39;s questions, the Minister for Rehabilitation, Youth Protection and Public Health, Lucie Charlebois, did not deny the return of the “Bolduc bonus”.
“We give bonuses to doctors to register patients on a list, to be able to say that every Quebecer has his doctor, but this is theoretical, it does not guarantee access to care. What Quebeckers want is to be taken care of and treated when they are sick. Obviously, this agreement was negotiated by doctors, for doctors. Where, in all this, is the obligation of result for the patients? What are the citizens of Quebec really getting from this agreement? », Concluded the member for Taillon.
