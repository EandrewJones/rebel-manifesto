Quebec - The member for Berthier and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, deplores the attitude of the Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, who asks Quebec farmers to choose between agricultural income stabilization insurance (ASRA) and the Agri-Québec program. This is a choice that is not, because the terms that the Minister is offering through ASRA are clearly disadvantageous.
In fact, producers who choose ASRA would see their future payments be deducted based on payments already received from Agri-Québec, due to the problem of cumulative tie-ups.
“By not solving the problem of cumulative tie-downs, which makes ASRA much less interesting, the minister is forcing the hand of farmers. And, by asking farmers to choose between those two programs by the end of the week, he&#39;s just trying to sneak out ASRA. Minister Paradis must give producers additional time, because they should not have to decide until the cumulative tie-down issue is resolved, ”declared André Villeneuve.
It should also be noted that the consultations carried out by La Financière agricole will lead to a final choice for each production, in all regions and at the same time. “The Liberal government is imposing a single solution, regardless of regional disparities. The grain producers of Abitibi and Lac-Saint-Jean will have to live with the decision taken for all of Quebec, even if their reality is very different from that of the central regions. Once again, Pierre Paradis shows us that he knows only one way to run the Ministry of Agriculture: divide and conquer. As it did for maple syrup production and representative associations, it is trying to wreak havoc in the community rather than bringing people together and reaching a consensus, ”concluded the MP for Berthier.
