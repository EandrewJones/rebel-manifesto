Quebec - Nicole Léger, the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for elementary and secondary education and school perseverance, asks the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Yves Bolduc, to stop playing ostrich and admit that the massive cuts decided by the Liberal government directly affect the most vulnerable students.
Today, we learn in an article in La Presse that schools are preparing to cut food aid and the “Agir autre” program, intended to promote academic success. “These are programs that are in place to directly help students from modest backgrounds. The liberal cuts hit precisely the students who need them the most! », Declared the member of the Parti Québécois.
“For several weeks, Minister Yves Bolduc has refused to recognize that he is solely responsible for the cuts made to schools in Quebec. This little game must stop. It was his office that gave school boards a list of 32 suggestions for possible cuts in student services, including the “Agir Otherwise” program. It is the minister who cut the money, it is the minister who suggested where to do it, it is the minister who is cutting aid to the most vulnerable; these are undeniably the Bolduc cuts, ”continued Nicole Léger.
The MP recalls that these cuts affecting the least privileged students occur when Minister Yves Bolduc still refuses to fully reimburse his doctor&#39;s premium of $ 215,000. “This shows once again that he should no longer be a minister. He must reimburse his premium and resign, ”concluded the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles.
