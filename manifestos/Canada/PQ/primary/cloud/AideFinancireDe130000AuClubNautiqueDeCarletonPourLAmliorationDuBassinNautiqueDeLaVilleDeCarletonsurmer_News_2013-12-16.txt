Carleton-sur-Mer– The Member for Bonaventure and Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks (wildlife and parks component), Mr. Sylvain Roy, on behalf of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Sylvain Gaudreault, announces the allocation of financial assistance of $ 130,000 to the Carleton Nautical Club for the realization of the first phase of its basin improvement project nautical activity of the City of Carleton-sur-Mer.
This project is necessary since the current configuration of the Carleton-sur-Mer marina, which accommodates around fifty boats, is the source of a major safety problem. In periods of prevailing winds, the location of the jetty lets in the swell, which causes some agitation inside the basin. By installing breakwaters, the basin improvement project will therefore reduce the force of the swell, contain the agitation inside the basin and better protect the boats moored there.
“It is with great pride that I announce this financial assistance from the Government of Quebec, which will ensure the safety of boaters, while contributing to the development of a regional maritime hub in the Baie des Chaleurs. I am convinced that this structuring project in terms of tourism will enhance the natural resources of Carleton-sur-Mer, maintain the exceptional quality of life of the people here and attract many visitors to one of the most beautiful bays in the world. Quebec, ”said MP Sylvain Roy.
Financial assistance comes from the conjunctural development fund of the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy.
