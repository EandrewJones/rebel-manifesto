Quebec - The member for Joliette and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of end-of-life care and justice, Véronique Hivon, denounces the decision of the MUHC, which refuses to offer medical assistance in dying to patients who are hospitalized at his palliative care unit.
“We were shocked to learn that the management of the MUHC is forcing the displacement of patients at the end of their life, on the pretext that the doctors in the palliative care unit refuse to provide them with medical assistance in dying. It is not up to patients to adapt to the organization of care; it is the institution&#39;s responsibility to provide care to patients, while respecting their autonomy, decision-making freedom and dignity. It is inconceivable that patients, because they are in a hospital or an X unit, need to fight to have access to the care to which they are entitled ”, declared Véronique Hivon.
“Requiring patients to have been treated at the MUHC for at least 18 months to receive medical assistance in dying is totally absurd and against the law. The minister must immediately call the MUHC to order, ensure that all institutions respect the rights of end-of-life patients, and remind them of the provisions provided for by law. The MUHC&#39;s situation must not create a barrier for patients at the end of their life, discourage them from seeking the care to which they are entitled, ”added the spokesperson.
“The Minister must guarantee all patients, regardless of where they are treated, access to the continuum of end-of-life care, including physician-assisted dying. It is absolutely inhumane to move patients at the end of their life because of resistance from certain circles and ideological opposition; patients and their rights must be at the heart of all the concerns of care teams, managers and the organization of care, ”concluded Véronique Hivon.
