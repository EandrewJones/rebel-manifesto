Quebec - During a press briefing with the Front commun des persons assisted sociales du Québec, the member for Rimouski and official opposition spokesperson for the fight against poverty, solidarity and social economy, Harold LeBel, called on the new Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Sam Hamad, to back down on the cuts to social assistance announced by his predecessor, François Blais.
“The Liberal government has hit the most vulnerable in our society hard, playing on prejudices involving foreign travel and the &#39;big houses&#39; of people on social assistance. Reality is not that. In all regions, we can see that families, community organizations and the poorest in our society are having difficulty coping with the many Liberal cuts. Will the new minister be more sensitive than his predecessor? Said Harold LeBel.
The deputy recalls that the National Strategy for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion expired in 2013. Nothing has been done by the Liberals to renew it.
“There is no impact study of the Liberal cuts; the government cuts, locked in a logic of recovering money, without worrying about the harmful effects on the families and on the regions. There is still time for Minister Hamad to back down on these new cuts to social assistance, ”he concluded.
