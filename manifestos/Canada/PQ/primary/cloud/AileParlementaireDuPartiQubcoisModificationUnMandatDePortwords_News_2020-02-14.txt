Québec, February 14, 2020 - The member for Matane-Matapédia and parliamentary leader of the Parti Québécois, Pascal Bérubé, has announced that he will now be the spokesperson for his parliamentary group on Indigenous affairs.
&quot;The Parti Québécois is proud of the decisive actions it has taken throughout its history to improve relations with the First Nations and Inuit of Quebec, in particular the official recognition of the aboriginal nations of Quebec, the Paix des Braves and the Law establishing the Eeyou Istchee Baie-James Regional Government. We therefore felt that it would be appropriate for our parliamentary leader to be responsible for this important issue from now on. I will do it with all the openness and attention it requires, ”he said.
