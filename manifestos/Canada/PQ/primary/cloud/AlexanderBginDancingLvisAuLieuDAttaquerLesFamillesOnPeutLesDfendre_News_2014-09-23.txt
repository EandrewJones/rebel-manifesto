Montreal - The president of the Parti Québécois, Raymond Archambault, has formalized the candidacy of Alexandre Bégin for the by-election in the riding of Lévis.
“Alexandre is a brilliant young man who is part of the political succession. Integral and honest, Alexandre will be able to support the proposals and positions of the Parti Québécois with dynamism and frankness during this election, ”said Mr. Archambault.
“The repeated cuts that characterized the first months of the Couillard government do not indicate anything good. Across Quebec, people are worried, they see the clouds appearing on the horizon. But the people of Lévis, who have repeatedly elected Parti Québécois candidates, know that they have another choice. Instead of attacking families, we can defend them. Instead of looking at Quebec culture as an expense, we can encourage its influence, ”said Mr. Bégin.
“In the National Assembly, men and women stand up every day to defend our jobs, our regions and our families, because they know how much the ideological cuts by the Couillard government will hurt Quebec. They work with determination and compassion for Quebeckers. It is with pleasure that I join this team, to bring our positive message to Lévis during the coming weeks, ”he concluded.
Alexandre Bégin, who since the end of his master&#39;s degree has been a political attaché at the National Assembly, has been involved in the Lévis community for many years. Originally from Lévis, he has always had the development of his city and region at heart. As evidenced by his expertise, he is particularly interested in understanding the issues that encourage people to participate in the democratic process.
