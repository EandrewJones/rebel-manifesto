“It&#39;s one to midnight. The Conservative government is mocking the National Assembly and forcing the stages of the study of its bill in the House of Commons for rapid adoption. It is an outright affront. Before it is too late, the Quebec government must therefore take all necessary steps to save the firearms registry, ”declared the member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for security. public, Stéphane Bergeron.
The member for Verchères notes in passing that the Conservatives have changed their speech. Previously, they agreed with the creation of a Quebec firearms registry. Today, they indicate their disagreement by claiming that it is a competence that does not fall under Quebec, even pushing arrogance to the point of asserting that the unanimity of the National Assembly is no match. facing the demands of the gun lobby.
&quot;Rather than disrespecting elected Quebec officials, the Conservatives should face the facts: their plan to abolish the firearms registry is not happening in Quebec,&quot; concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
