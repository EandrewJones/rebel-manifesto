Québec, August 16, 2016 - MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and Parti Québécois spokesperson on the status of women, Carole Poirier, is sorry that the young liberals rejected a resolution asking their party to commit to presenting between 40% and 60% of female candidates in each election.
“As members of the National Assembly of Quebec, we have an obligation to strive for the representativeness of the entire population. Yet, for too long, women have been told that change will happen sooner or later. At the Parti Québécois, we believe that concrete and daring actions must be taken as of the next election, in 2018, ”said Carole Poirier.
The MP wanted to remind elected members of the Liberal Party that their former leader, Jean Charest, nevertheless signed the manifesto for parity of the Women, Politics and Democracy Group. In addition, last March, a Liberal MP tabled a mandate to examine the place of women in politics. “The position of the young liberals is completely illogical and contradictory. What should we think of it? On the part of the Parti Québécois, on the other hand, we are consistent: in November 2015, our national council adopted the following resolution: &quot;It is proposed that the next government of the Parti Québécois apply parity when forming the Council of Ministers.&quot; Moreover, our national executive is already parity. ”
In addition, to achieve parity in politics and within decision-making apparatus, the Parti Québécois made the following 10 commitments last March:
“The first minister responsible for the Status of Women was Lise Payette in 1979. Almost 40 years later, we see that the place of women in politics has been strengthened, but that we can do more. The Parti Québécois intends to assume its responsibilities; he will continue to embody change for Quebec women, because the future of our nation depends on equality between women and men, ”concluded Carole Poirier.
