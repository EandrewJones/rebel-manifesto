Quebec - The member for Sanguinet and official opposition spokesperson for the Conseil du trésor and on pension plans, Alain Therrien, denounces the inconsistency of the president of the Conseil du trésor, Martin Coiteux, on the subject of generous allowances for transportation given to senior officials and executives of Crown corporations.
Questioned this morning at the National Assembly by journalists, the President of the Treasury Board mentioned that the allowances were part of the total compensation and that the government &quot;[was] not in the mode of reviewing existing contracts&quot;.
“However, in the case of Bill 3 concerning the pension plans of municipal employees and retirees, the government did not hesitate to break the contracts and collective agreements duly signed. This inconsistency is flagrant; we are attacking the middle class, families and retirees, but we do not want to break the contracts signed with senior officials or the heads of crown corporations. The government does not know where it is going, except when it comes to its austerity policy, which directly affects families and regions of Quebec, ”said Alain Therrien.
