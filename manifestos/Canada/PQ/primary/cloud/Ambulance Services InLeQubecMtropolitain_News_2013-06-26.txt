Quebec - Ambulance services will be enhanced in metropolitan Quebec, with the addition of three ambulances and 296.5 additional hours of service per week. This was announced today by the Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Seniors, Réjean Hébert, and the Minister responsible for the Capitale-Nationale region, Agnès Maltais.
“Pre-hospital emergency services are a crucial part of the care chain and that is why we are keen to take the necessary measures to improve this service offering. I would also like to thank the pre-hospital emergency community in this area, which played a very constructive role in improving the efficiency of ambulance transport, ”said Minister Hébert.
This territory is served by two ambulance companies, the Coopérative des technicians ambulance du Québec (CTAQ) and Dessercomm. The first will have three more ambulances, allowing it to add 260 hours of service per week. The second, with its current vehicles, will be able to provide 36.5 additional hours of service per week. This development is made possible thanks to an investment of $ 2,080,800, on an annual basis, from the Department of Health and Social Services.
“Long-awaited, this addition of resources meets an important need in the region. This will significantly improve ambulance coverage in metropolitan Quebec, for the benefit of the population, ”said the Minister responsible for the Capitale-Nationale region, Ms. Agnès Maltais.
