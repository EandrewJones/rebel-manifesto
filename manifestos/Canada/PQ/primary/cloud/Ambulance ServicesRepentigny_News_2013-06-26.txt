Quebec - Ambulance services will be enhanced in Repentigny, with the addition of an ambulance and 168 additional hours of service per week. This was announced today by the Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Seniors, Réjean Hébert, and the MNA for Repentigny, Scott McKay.
“Pre-hospital emergency services are a crucial part of the care chain and that is why we are keen to take the necessary measures to improve this service offering. We are therefore happy to support the partners in this territory with the addition of this ambulance resource, ”said Dr. Hébert.
This territory is served by the company Ambulance Repentigny. This development is made possible thanks to an investment of $ 1,184,900 on an annual basis from the Department of Health and Social Services.

By improving ambulance coverage in Repentigny in this way, our government is showing that it understands the needs of our population in the midst of a demographic explosion and that it is truly listening, ”said Repentigny MNA Scott McKay.
