Quebec - The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr. François Gendron, announces specific assistance to improve the productivity of beef businesses. This aid aims to support feeder calf rearing businesses with gross agricultural income of less than $ 100,000. These companies represent nearly 68% of cattle operations in Quebec.
“Since taking office as Minister, cattle producers have challenged me and told me about the specific problems they have been facing over the past few years. Thanks to this specific assistance, combined with support and advisory services as well as initiatives recommended by agricultural advisers, cattle producers will make their businesses more efficient and more competitive. We must reverse the trend to stimulate beef production in the various regions of Quebec, ”said François Gendron.
Specifically, this aid provides, initially, for personalized support by an agricultural advisor who will prepare an action plan following a simplified diagnosis determining the strengths and weaknesses of the company. Secondly, the company will be able to benefit from financial assistance to carry out the interventions recommended in the action plan that concerns it. Financial assistance may reach 50% of eligible expenses, up to a maximum of $ 10,000.
“This assistance is necessary and will meet the specific needs of the beef sector. Companies in this sector play an important role in terms of land use and this is one of the reasons that lead us to do everything possible to ensure their growth and sustainability, ”the Minister concluded.
