A treatment exists; it must be accessible
Québec, February 8, 2018 - As part of the tabling of a petition with more than 15,000 signatures, the member for Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for social services, youth protection and For issues affecting the drug industry, Dave Turcotte held a press briefing during which he demanded that the drug Spinraza, recognized as an effective treatment for stopping the progression of spinal muscular atrophy, be funded by the RAMQ.
IN SHORT
Accompanied by children with spinal muscular atrophy and their parents, the deputy recalled the benefits of the drug Spinraza. “Clinical evidence abounds: Spinraza improves the motor and breathing capacities of people with the disease and reduces the progression of the disease. It therefore improves the quality of life of patients and reduces the burden on the shoulders of their loved ones. The pressure on the health network would also be reduced ”, he argued.
Dave Turcotte insists: funding Spinraza is a matter of justice. “There is no reason to justify discriminating against patients with spinal muscular atrophy; other treatments related to rare diseases are funded on the basis of knowledge, clinical trials and results similar to those for Spinraza, ”he added.
However, underlines the spokesperson, for the moment, the company producing the Spinraza sells it much too expensive. “The Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette, must put pressure on the company to reduce its prices. Thus, the impact on public finances, already very low, would be almost zero. But the most important thing is that it intervenes quickly. Because the earlier the treatment is administered, the more the motor and respiratory capacities of the patients are preserved. We do not have the right to deprive Quebecers suffering from spinal muscular atrophy of the hope for a better life, ”he concluded.
