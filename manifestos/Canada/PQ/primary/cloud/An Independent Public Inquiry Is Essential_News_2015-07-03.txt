Québec, July 3, 2015 - Martine Ouellet, the member for Vachon and official opposition critic for transport, maritime strategy and transport electrification, and the member for Verchères and spokesperson for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, deplore the fact that the federal Minister of Transport, Lisa Raitt, refuses to launch an independent public inquiry to shed light on the shortcomings of Transport Canada that led to the Lac-Mégantic tragedy in July 2013, and this despite the Lac-Mégantic Citizens&#39; Committee calling for such an investigation into the internal management of the federal department.
“Lisa Raitt&#39;s attitude on this issue is unacceptable. For the first time since the tragedy, she half-heartedly acknowledges the responsibility of her department, but she refuses to open the books so that Quebeckers can find out what really happened. In addition, although she claims that changes have been made within the department, rail accidents involving hazardous materials are piling up in Canada. Obviously, there is still work to be done, ”said Martine Ouellet.
“The confidence of Quebecers in Transport Canada is already at its lowest. Closing the minister will only make the situation worse. What the citizens of Lac? Mégantic are asking for is simple, it is more transparency to help them understand what really happened on the night of July 5 to 6, 2013. Above all, they want to take all necessary means to prevent another community in Quebec from experiencing such a disaster. The federal government must open the doors of its department and allow a real examination of its internal methods, ”concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
