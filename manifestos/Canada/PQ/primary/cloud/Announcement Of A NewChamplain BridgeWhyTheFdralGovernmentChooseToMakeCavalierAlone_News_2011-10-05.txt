Quebec - Nicolas Girard, the MP for Gouin and official opposition critic for transport, deplores the fact that the federal government has chosen to go it alone in the construction project of a new Champlain Bridge. &quot;The absence of the Government of Quebec is worrying for the rest of things since such a project requires concerted action by all stakeholders in the metropolis and will entail significant costs for Quebeckers,&quot; said the deputy.
&quot;For five years, studies have shown us the urgency of building a new bridge to ensure the safety of all users as well as the fluidity of the transport of goods,&quot; said Nicolas Girard, recalling the vital link for the economy of Quebec. that is the Champlain Bridge. Why did you wait so long? He wonders.
“There is no specific timetable or funding and, above all, there is no reference to public transit, which must be an integral part of a new bridge. All stakeholders in the metropolis as well as the government of Quebec are of the opinion that a light rail system (LRT) should be part of the project. By working alone, the federal government is ignoring the will and needs of the population of the greater metropolitan area, ”added the spokesperson.
Moreover, with regard to the idea that a toll be instituted, the member for Gouin affirmed that “as long as the public transport offer is not greater, more efficient and faster, it will be premature to &#39;impose such a toll on motorists&#39;.
“The federal government&#39;s choice to work in silos is worrying for the future. Motorists have already suffered the inconvenience of the lack of planning and consultation between Quebec and Ottawa, history should not repeat itself as work on the Turcot interchange will begin next year and on the new bridge in the following years ”, concluded Nicolas Girard, making a commitment to continue to put the necessary pressure so that today&#39;s announcement really materializes and as quickly as possible.
