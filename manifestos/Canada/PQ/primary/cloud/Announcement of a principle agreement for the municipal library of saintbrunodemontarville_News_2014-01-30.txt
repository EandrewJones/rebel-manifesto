Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville– The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, announces an agreement in principle of $ 1,088,710 with the City of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville for the renovation of the municipal library.
“Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville has long stood out as a city of extraordinary dynamism and today&#39;s agreement bears witness to this once again. There is no doubt that libraries remain a place of reference for cultural vitality. In the performance of my duties, I am able to observe to what extent culture contributes to the quality of life in our cities, in addition to strengthening the social fabric, ”said Maka Kotto.
The agreement in principle will allow the City to complete the studies and go through the various stages leading to a complete definition of the library renovation project. The objective of this agreement is to make the municipal library more functional, because the current building no longer meets the needs of the citizens of the city.
The building in which the municipal library of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville is located was built in 1983 and has never undergone major renovations. The project will allow for the redevelopment as well as the purchase of furniture and specialized equipment. The library is located in the heart of the municipality, and its proximity to the city center promotes its accessibility for residents. It serves a population of approximately 26,600 inhabitants.
The agreement in principle is made possible thanks to the Capital Assistance program of the Ministry of Culture and Communications. The City of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville is a partner in this project and is contributing by contributing $ 1,088,710, the other half of the total amount estimated at $ 2,177,420.
