Quebec - The deputy for Duplessis, Lorraine Richard, is delighted with the realization of the silicon metal plant project, a project of the multinational FerroAtlántica, in Port-Cartier. She recalls that this establishment was made possible thanks to the interventions of the government of the Parti Québécois.
Indeed, during her participation in the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2013, Prime Minister Pauline Marois met the president of FerroAtlántica to discuss the possibility of this establishment. In January 2014, the Parti Québécois government announced what is happening today.
“This structuring project for the economy of our region and all of Quebec means 345 quality jobs, in addition to all the indirect jobs that will be created. The city of Port-Cartier and the Côte-Nord region represent an interesting business environment, in addition to being strategically located for the transportation and logistics of a plant of this size, ”said Lorraine Richard.
The FerroAtlántica project represents investments of $ 382 million and ultimately produces 100,000 tonnes of silicon per year.
Lorraine Richard had also ardently defended the strategic position of Port-Cartier during a meeting between the people of FerroAtlántica and the city&#39;s decision-makers last March. “During these discussions, I was able to observe the dynamism and solid organization of the people in the community. They succeeded and I congratulate them for all the work accomplished, ”concluded the MP.
