Quebec - Following the decision taken by MP Claude Pinard not to stand for the next election campaign, the leader of the official opposition, Pauline Marois, paid tribute to her today. Here is the message she sent him.
“Quebec, March 29, 2012
Mr. Claude Pinard Member of Parliament for Saint-Maurice 695, avenue de la Station Shawinigan (Québec) G9N 1V9
Dear Colleague,
After more than 16 years serving the citizens of the riding of Saint-Maurice and Quebec, you have chosen not to represent yourself in the next general election. Knowing the attachment and love you have for the citizens of Saint-Maurice and the Mauricie in general, I have no doubt that this decision was not easy to take. I am sure they will welcome it with regret.
Throughout your political career, you have shown great determination in all the causes and all the issues that you have defended. You have always done it with a lot of self-sacrifice and outspokenness and you have never hesitated to defend your riding and the Mauricie.
With you, Claude, we have always had the right facts. You have been able to deliver the substance of your thoughts, while always maintaining the greatest respect for your fellow Members and for our institutions. Your frank camaraderie will have made you a member appreciated by all the members of the National Assembly.
Finally, I cannot ignore your involvement in the cause of Quebec, which is at the origin of your time in politics. Your unshakeable convictions have made you a most effective spokesperson for the promotion of the independence of Quebec.
I am convinced that the Parti Québécois and the sovereignist movement will always be able to count on you when the time comes to fight battles for Quebec and for the Mauricie. You can be proud of what you have accomplished.
Thank you for your great loyalty to Quebec!
PAULINE MAROIS &quot;
