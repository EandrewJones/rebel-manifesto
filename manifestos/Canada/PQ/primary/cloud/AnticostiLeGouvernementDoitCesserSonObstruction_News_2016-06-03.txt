Quebec– The member for Sanguinet and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, and the member for Duplessis and spokesperson for northern development, Lorraine Richard, reacted today to the announcement of the resignation of Alexandre Gagnon as spokesperson for Hydrocarbons Anticosti. Members are calling on the government to stop obstructing exploration work on Anticosti Island using false pretexts, such as failure to meet administrative deadlines or the improvised setting up of a new committee.
“The Anticosti file should not be subjected to the political maneuvers of Philippe Couillard. The government must follow up on the publication of the SEA report, the strategic environmental assessment, specific to Anticosti. It must also immediately cease its systematic obstruction and allow the program provided for in the contract to be respected, ”claimed Alain Therrien.
“The resignation today of spokesperson Alexandre Gagnon sends the message that private companies that sign partnerships or contracts with the government of Quebec cannot trust Philippe Couillard, nor his ministers. It is disturbing, when we know that the Quebec economy has been in a bad position since the Liberals came to power in 2014, ”continued Lorraine Richard.
Let us recall that on May 9, the government announced to Pétrolia, its business partner, that a new &quot;committee of experts&quot;, which had never been discussed before, was going to be created to delay the analysis of the request for authorization of exploratory work. This clearly illustrates how urgent it is for the Liberal government to table the bill on hydrocarbons that it has been promising for months in order to put an end to Philippe Couillard&#39;s double talk and to get companies out of uncertainty.
