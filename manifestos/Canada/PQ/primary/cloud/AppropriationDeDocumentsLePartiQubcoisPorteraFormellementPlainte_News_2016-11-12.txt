Montreal - Following the appropriation of strategic documents by two employees who defected from the Parti Québécois to the Coalition Avenir Québec, the general management of the Parti Québécois decided to file a complaint with the police authorities for theft of documents.
Following the recovery efforts, it was possible to observe that the defector employees had taken possession of nominative, confidential, strategic and electoral documents. Also, the computer records indicate that one of the employees in question attempted to access the Parti Québécois computer system during and after her visit to the CAQ. In the coming days, the Parti Québécois will therefore file a complaint with the police department concerned for the theft of documents.
