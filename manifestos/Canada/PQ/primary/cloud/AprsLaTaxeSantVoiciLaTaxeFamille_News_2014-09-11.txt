Quebec - The member for Terrebonne and official opposition spokesperson for families, Mathieu Traversy, denounces the attack that the Liberal government is preparing to make by putting an end to the universality of prices for educational childcare services , to adjust them by adding a tax calculated according to the parents&#39; income.
“After the liberal health tax, here is the family tax! During the last election campaign, the Liberal Party insisted that there would be no tariff shock for families; now he is attacking them directly with a new tax. The government is breaking its word. At the first opportunity, due to his inability to stimulate Quebec&#39;s economy and job creation, Philippe Couillard takes up the good old Liberal recipe: making families pay more taxes, ”said Mathieu Traversy.
The middle class will pay more
Let’s not kid ourselves; this measure will not only affect the very top earners, it will target middle class families head on. “These families, who already bear a large tax burden, will have to pay even more for a service that they already finance fairly through their taxes. Moreover, in the same childcare center, how can we justify that some parents pay more than others for the same service? &quot;, he added.
The deputy recalls that equal opportunities and accessibility for all are the basis of the establishment of childcare centers. Quality childcare services make it possible to better reconcile family life and work. In addition, a single mother or father can access the labor market more easily. The resulting economic contribution is significant, as are the quality jobs created in all regions of Quebec.
“Once again, the Liberals are confusing an investment for the whole of society with an expense. The universality of tariffs for childcare services ensures equal opportunities. For ideological reasons, the Liberals are throwing in the trash an essential part of Quebec&#39;s social safety net, ”concluded Mathieu Traversy.
