Quebec, September 13, 2016 - The member for Matane-Matapédia and public security spokesperson for the Parti Québécois, Pascal Bérubé, is surprised to see the Minister of Public Security, Martin Coiteux, delegate to his parliamentary assistant, the deputy of Vimont, Jean Rousselle, a tour of the establishments of detention.
“Not only does Martin Coiteux not bother to visit the detention facilities himself but, in addition, we are repeating the scenario of last February, when the Minister of Transport caused general astonishment by sending the MP for Mégantic inspect the Matane – Baie-Comeau – Godbout ferry. After Ghislain Bolduc who checks the bolts of a ship, we are entitled to Jean Rousselle who examines the prisons. It&#39;s not serious, ”said Pascal Bérubé.
The problems facing detention facilities are serious: overcrowding, understaffing, lack of maintenance, drone flights, riots, etc. “Last July, I proposed to the government a realistic solution by asking for a traveling parliamentary committee. Thus, members of all political parties could hear the testimony of people directly concerned by these issues. The Minister of Public Security refuses this proposal, preferring to send his parliamentary assistant to visit the establishments, but without involving anyone else in the process. We are not fools; the Liberals have to admit that they are doing this to buy time, not to solve problems, ”concluded the member.
