Quebec - On April 24, the Parti Québécois will present a motion urging the crown corporation not to connect the aerodrome project in Neuville to the electricity network. Yesterday, during the study of credits, Thierry Vandal confided that he had no choice to connect the aerodrome project, unless he received a motion from the National Assembly asking him not to do it.
“At the suggestion of Thierry Vandal, we will therefore present a motion. Without reservation, the Liberal government and the MP for Portneuf will have the opportunity to say whether or not they support the project, which is rejected by a majority of citizens, ”declared the MP for Marie-Victorin and spokesperson for the official opposition on energy, Bernard Drainville.
“To place itself in wait-and-see mode, as the ministers of the Charest government are doing before Federal Minister Denis Lebel, is indecent. It is one minute to midnight and Liberal apathy greatly worries the citizens of the riding of Portneuf. MP Michel Matte may well shout, the actions taken by the government authorities go in the opposite direction of his remarks. We must move, ”concluded the member for Taschereau and official opposition spokesperson for the Capitale-Nationale, Agnès Maltais.
