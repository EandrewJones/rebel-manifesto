Quebec - Following the announcement of a production shutdown and the layoff of workers at the Tio mine of the Rio Tinto, Fer et Titane company, in Havre-Saint-Pierre, the member for Duplessis et porte - speech of the Parti Québécois on northern development, Lorraine Richard, denounces the inaction of the Liberal government, which is doing nothing to help the communities concerned.
Nearly 350 workers will be affected by the suspension of activities at the Tio mine, scheduled for mid-October and until March 2016; in addition, around a hundred positions will be permanently abolished. This is another hard blow for the Côte-Nord region, already severely affected by the slowdown in mining activities.
“The government must quickly find solutions to help workers, businesses and communities who are really living the consequences of this production shutdown. With the Plan Nord, the Liberal government of Jean Charest has appropriated the merit of a favorable situation. Now that the economic situation is unfavorable, we can clearly see that Philippe Couillard&#39;s Plan Nord is empty and that the communities are left to fend for themselves. The only economic policy of the Liberal government is a plan that only serves to boost its image when the metals market is doing well, ”said Lorraine Richard.
In Minganie, direct and indirect jobs linked to Rio Tinto represent a very large part of the economy, and several companies depend exclusively on the activities of the Tio mine. “The Liberal government is all about austerity. When will there be a real economic recovery? What does it intend to do to support diversification and develop the economy of the regions? Will the 17 Plan Nord projects provide jobs for the 350 workers in Havre-Saint-Pierre? I don&#39;t believe it, ”concluded Lorraine Richard.
