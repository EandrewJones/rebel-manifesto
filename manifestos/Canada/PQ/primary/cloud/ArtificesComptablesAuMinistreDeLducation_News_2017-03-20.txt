Québec, March 20, 2017 - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of education, research, school perseverance and literacy, Alexandre Cloutier, denounces the gap of $ 627 million between the amounts announced and what is actually invested in the education network for the year 2016-2017. Delays which are lengthening to obtain a ministerial authorization, sums promised which never arrive, envelopes so directed that they cannot be spent ... all this creates accounting artifices and explains the huge discrepancy observed.
“The Liberals present us with version 2.0 of austerity, more subtle, more devious, but which still hurts just as much. The government claims it is investing, but in reality it is not spending what it promised. All this mess, while the needs explode in the network, as the number of students in difficulty increases and several schools are falling into ruin, ”lamented Alexandre Cloutier.
“If you dig a little deeper, you can see that the delays at the ministry have disastrous consequences on student services. At the college level, the budgetary terms concerning the reception and integration of Aboriginals, students with disabilities and francization arrived more than 6 months late; in a few places, they are even still delayed. In some cases, the money arrives so late that management no longer even has the ability to commit resources. Result: the money is not spent and the sums continue to lie dormant in the ministry, ”added the deputy.
“As if that weren&#39;t enough, the Liberals took advantage of the latest economic update to announce an additional $ 35 million for the current school year. However, as of today, the education network is still awaiting details. Remember last year; the scenario was exactly the same. The Liberals then announced $ 20 million during the update and, in the end, the funds inflated the surpluses rather than being invested in services, ”the spokesperson concluded.
