Quebec - The member for René-Lévesque and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in municipal affairs, Martin Ouellet, is troubled by the statements of the Minister of Public Security and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Martin Coiteux, as to who is wearing responsibility for the solutions to be put in place to avoid the repetition of an event such as the one that occurred yesterday in the Rivière-des-Prairies – Pointe-aux-Trembles borough, during which a 55-year-old woman lost her life after presumably being attacked by a pit bull. “The autonomy of cities is not the real debate, at the moment,” he said at the outset.
“Today, I am asking Minister Coiteux to show leadership and pragmatism so that this situation is dealt with at the national level. He said he was open to looking at new avenues, and I believe that we must examine this together so that the population feels safe in every neighborhood, town and village in Quebec. Ontario has already legislated to ban pitbulls and I believe that we can - if not we must - do it in Quebec too. The safety of Quebeckers is at stake, ”the member for René-Lévesque also explained.
“The drama of yesterday left a strong perception in the public opinion as for the real danger of this type of animal in the communities. Today, the government cannot back down and send the ball back to the municipalities&#39; court. The death of this lady is one death too many. The minister has a duty to reassure the population; to do this, he must first stop disempowering himself and then act before there are other victims, ”concluded Martin Ouellet.
