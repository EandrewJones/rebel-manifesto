Quebec City, January 30, 2017 - The Leader of the Official Opposition, Jean-François Lisée, has issued the following statement in reaction to the terrorist attack at the Islamic Cultural Center in Quebec.
“We were all struck by the horror, touched by the grief that befell the people of Quebec and the Muslim community. Quebeckers and fathers have been cowardly broke, leaving a large number of people, women and children, to mourn. I offer my condolences to the loved ones and families of the victims.
These people were shot for a reason: they exercised a fundamental right, the right to assemble in a place of worship. We are all affected in our freedom.
In one of the most peaceful cities in the world, this terrorist act is appalling. On behalf of the Parti Québécois, I invite all Quebecers to show their solidarity with our fellow citizens of the Muslim faith. As my colleague Agnès Maltais said so well, one of the great qualities of life in Quebec and in Quebec is the refusal of violence. The people of my country, all the people of my country, are people of words and not of violence.
We must affirm this, all united, in the hours and days to come. If you meet a Muslim from Quebec, say hello. Offer him your condolences. &quot;
