Quebec - The MNA for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, the MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesperson for international relations, Carole Poirier, as well as the MNA for Joliette and spokesperson for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, express, on behalf of all elected members of the Parti Québécois, their solidarity with the French people and the journalistic community in the face of the terrible attack perpetrated early this morning at the headquarters of the Charlie Hebdo newspaper.
“Our hearts go out to the families of the victims, to whom we offer our most sincere condolences, but also, more broadly, to the representatives of the press. As this area is one of the pillars of our democracy, an attack on journalists always has a special resonance. We denounce this attack and remain in solidarity with the French and all those who fight for press freedom, a value that we share, ”said the leader of the official opposition.
“The French Republic has always placed press freedom at the heart of its fundamental values, even if it has known acts of violence that targeted it. Each time, she was able to get up, unite and defend herself against these attacks, ”added the MP for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Carole Poirier.
“The attack that was perpetrated this morning targeted representatives of a newspaper which has always had the courage to use the absurd to denounce events or situations. Charlie Hebdo had dared to publish cartoons and texts that invited its readers to defend freedom of conscience. We would like to express our solidarity with all the representatives of the press, who fight every day to defend the fundamental right of populations to have access to information, ”concluded the MNA for Joliette, Véronique Hivon.
