Quebec - The MNA for Saint-Jérôme and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, and the MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and Parti Québécois spokesperson for international relations, Carole Poirier, wish to express their sincere condolences and their compassion for the families and loved ones of the victims of the terrorist attacks perpetrated at the Hotel Splendid and at the Café Cappucino, in Ouagadougou, in which six Quebecers lost their lives.
“Our thoughts are with the families of the 23 victims from 18 different countries, 6 of whom are from Quebec. I also wish a speedy recovery to the many injured in the attacks. On behalf of the Parti Québécois, I also offer my condolences to the families of the victims, as well as my solidarity with Turkey, following the attack in a tourist district of Istanbul on January 12. Quebec must continue to fight these attacks against our values of freedom and democracy. I strongly condemn these barbaric and despicable gestures, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“These attacks are expressions of senseless hatred, to which no one can remain indifferent. Like many of our fellow citizens, we are in shock as a result of these heinous acts of violence that threaten our democracies. I also express my condolences to the family of Laval businessman Tahar Amer-Ouali, the first Quebecer victim of the Islamic State armed group abroad, who died in a terrorist attack in Jakarta, in Indonesia, last Thursday, ”added Carole Poirier.
