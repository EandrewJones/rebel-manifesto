Quebec, July 13, 2016 - The member for Sanguinet and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of the economy, Alain Therrien, deplores the blatant lack of coherence of the Liberal Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, who suggested that Quebec taxpayers could again having to pay for the C Series center of excellence.
“The Prime Minister is improvising with hundreds of millions of dollars. After his $ 1 billion investment, he boasted that in exchange there would be a center of excellence. Today he says we may be paying for it. Now, while the federal government itself has changed the law so that aircraft maintenance is no longer done in Montreal, Quebeckers would have to pay for the future center of excellence to emerge. It is enough for the federal government to do its part, ”declared Alain Therrien.
The member once again denounced the Prime Minister&#39;s abandonment of the federal contribution to Quebec&#39;s flagship of aeronautics. “The Prime Minister should demand and insist that the federal government participate, particularly in the creation of the center of excellence. After having abandoned the pressure on the federal government to obtain financial assistance, he now says that it is Quebec alone that will still have to pay, ”he concluded.
