Quebec - On February 12, we learned that a hearing by the Commission des transports du Québec (CTQ) concerning the reduction in Orléans Express services in the regions would be held in Quebec on March 14. Gaétan Lelièvre, Parti Québécois spokesperson for regional development, and Martine Ouellet, spokesperson for transport, criticize this decision, which they perceive as a flagrant lack of respect for citizens living in the regions and using the coach services in question.
Gaétan Lelièvre also deplores the fact that the CTQ&#39;s mandate relates only to the financial impacts that the reduction in services will have on the Orléans Express company, to the detriment of its negative impact on customers and regional development. “This adds to a long list of examples showing the government&#39;s lack of consideration for the regions,” he said.
“This is a major issue for the mobility of people and the maintenance of public transport services in the regions. People are mobilized and take the issue to heart. I can cite as an example the case of the voluntary Sauvetage Transport Percé committee which, for the past year, has been trying to be heard by the Ministry of Transport and the CTQ. However, the latter is now asking him to travel 1,500 km to attend a hearing directly concerning him ”, denounced Martine Ouellet.
The reduction in services in the regions was authorized in October 2014 by the CTQ and has been applied since January 2015. In addition to this reduction, some routes have literally been abandoned. For example, the Victoriaville – Thetford Mines, Grande-Rivière – Gaspé and Trois-Rivières – La Tuque routes are no longer offered by Orléans Express.
“What we are asking for is a regional tour of the Commission. By holding its hearing in Quebec, the CTQ discourages or prevents concerned and mobilized citizens from intervening on the subject. It is unfair and unjustifiable ”, also insisted on Gaétan Lelièvre.
