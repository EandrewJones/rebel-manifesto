Quebec - Member of Parliament for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition critic for elementary and secondary education, Nicole Léger, expressed concerns for students, teachers, support staff and schools of Quebec, on the eve of the tabling of the budget by the Minister of Finance.
In fact, the words of the Minister of Education over the last few days do not reassure the education community and families in Quebec. When asked if there are any cuts to come in the next budget, he replied, “I remember very well that there were some very good years. The years, at the moment, are a little more difficult. I think Quebeckers are not made of chocolate. &quot;
This statement made Nicole Léger react. “Will the minister reassure the education community and families in Quebec, and tell us that there will be no further cuts in student services? Can he confirm that he does not intend to increase the number of students in the classes? She asked.
Recall that the predecessor of François Blais used to improvise and ignore his partners. “The latest cuts by former Minister Yves Bolduc, particularly in homework help, food aid and school libraries, have done a lot of harm. His intentions, including those of merging school boards and increasing the teacher-student ratio, were never clear and all seemed to have been written on the corner of a table. The new Minister of Education must restore the situation and confirm to us that student services will be spared, ”concluded Nicole Léger.
