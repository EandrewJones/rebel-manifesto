Quebec - The MNA for Matapedia and official opposition spokesperson for social services, Danielle Doyer, said she was extremely disappointed with the responses of the Minister for Social Services, Dominique Vien, to her questions on families of &#39;children and people with autism or pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). Families of people with autism gathered in front of the National Assembly today.
“These families are currently going through a real obstacle course in order to obtain a diagnosis, specialized services and a little respite. They literally feel abandoned by the government of Jean Charest, which promised them sea and people in 2003, ”declared the Member for Matapedia.
The official opposition spokesperson for social services recalled that the number of people with autism or who have PDD has tripled since 2003. From 3000 children present in the education network in 2003, it is now 12,000 children. These data do not take into account adolescents and adults who are not integrated into the education network.
“The Liberal government does not hear the heartfelt cry of families. That Minister Vien refuses to meet, since taking office in August 2010, organizations that offer front-line services, is deeply contemptuous, ”said Danielle Doyer.
&quot;The Prime Minister must act now and show the same compassion he showed in the opposition when he demanded the tabling of a government action plan, a request to which the Parti Québécois government responded by 2003. Now that the number of people who need services has tripled, can he hear the demands and meet the needs? », Concluded Danielle Doyer.
