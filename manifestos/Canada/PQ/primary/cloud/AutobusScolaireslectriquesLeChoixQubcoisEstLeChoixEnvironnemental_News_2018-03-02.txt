Québec, March 2, 2018 - The official opposition spokesperson for transport electrification, Marc Bourcier, presented 5 measures that will make it possible to electrify all of Québec&#39;s school buses by 2030.
At a press briefing, Marc Bourcier detailed the 5 measures:
· Improve the financial support program for the deployment of electric school buses. The Liberal government has announced that the one-time rebate granted for the purchase of a fully electric school bus will increase, between 2018-2019 and 2020-2021, from $ 125,000 to $ 105,000. We will maintain this amount at $ 125,000.
· Set up an energy credit from Hydro-Québec to reduce the electricity bill of electric school bus operators.
