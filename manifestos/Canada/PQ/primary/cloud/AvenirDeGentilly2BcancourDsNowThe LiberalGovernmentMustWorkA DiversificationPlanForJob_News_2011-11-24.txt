Quebec - While the scenario of the downgrading of Gentilly-2 is more and more likely, the Parti Québécois is now calling for an employment diversification plan to allow Center-du-Quebec and the Mauricie a smooth transition resulting from the decommissioning of the Gentilly-2 nuclear power plant in Bécancour.
“With the answers that Minister Clément Gignac has been giving over the past few days, it seems fairly clear that the Liberal government is seriously juggling the idea of not proceeding with the refurbishment of the nuclear power plant. In order to limit the impacts for the 800 workers, the government must, as of now, work on an economic diversification plan. It is possible to do it and that is what the Parti Québécois is asking for, ”declared the member for Marie-Victorin and official opposition spokesperson for energy, Bernard Drainville.
He recalled that last May, the leader of the official opposition, Pauline Marois, made known the need for the region to set up an economic fund of $ 200 million intended specifically for the economic diversification of the Center-du -Quebec and Mauricie.
“We strongly believe in the region&#39;s potential to recover from a nuclear power plant shutdown. Renewable energies offer a real opportunity for the region as for the whole of Quebec. With the communities, with direct sellers, we will be able to diversify the regional economy and create more jobs that the closure will entail, ”concluded Bernard Drainville.
