Québec, July 6, 2020 - As a member of the Committee on Transport and the Environment (CTE), the deputy for Îles-de-la-Madeleine and Parti Québécois transport spokesperson, Joël Arseneau, calls for a mandate of initiative so that its members can look into the future of air links to and between the regions of Quebec, a crucial issue for the occupation and development of our vast territory.
Following the decision of Air Canada, which announced last week the suspension of 8 routes and 3 regional stopovers in Quebec, the Parti Québécois is of the opinion that we must henceforth consider a 100% Quebec solution, in order to secure and sustain the air service offer in the regions. &quot;It is time to take matters in hand and put in place a real national air transport policy, so that the interests of the regions of Quebec stop being flouted by bad corporate citizens like Air Canada,&quot; said Joël. Arseneau.
With this in mind, the deputy submitted a request for the CTE, of which he is a member, to obtain a mandate of initiative in this regard. “The government must take this opportunity to prove that it is economically nationalist; I ask him to take his responsibilities and take concrete action to ensure the maintenance of regional air links, essential for our economy as well as for the occupation and development of the territory. A mandate of initiative relating to regional air transport would enable elected officials to hear the main regional stakeholders as well as experts, and to find lasting solutions guaranteeing stability as regards regional air services, as well as their sustainability ”, a- he continued.
Joël Arseneau also notes that although it is necessary, the Assistance Program for maintaining essential regional air services in times of health emergency is not sufficient. “First and foremost, until lasting solutions are found, the Government of Quebec must broaden the scope of this program to routes abandoned by Air Canada and finance it adequately, to ensure a certain profitability for the companies that will eventually take the Air Canada relay - from whom we obviously have nothing more to expect, ”concluded the member for Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
