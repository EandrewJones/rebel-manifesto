Quebec - “Your exceptional work, determination and dedication have opened up new horizons. Your positive influence reflects on Quebeckers, and goes beyond our borders. You make us extremely proud. May your names and accomplishments remain forever in our collective memory and inspire future generations. It is in these terms that the Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, today paid tribute to the recipients of the Ordre national du Québec.
This year, 33 Quebec personalities were welcomed or promoted within the Ordre national du Québec: two grand officers (respectively officers since 1985 and 2002), three officers and nine officers, as well as nine knights and ten knights.
The insignia of the Ordre national du Québec were presented today to 31 recipients, three of the new members unable to attend the ceremony. Singer Isabelle Boulay, appointed last year to the rank of signet ring, also received her badge.
