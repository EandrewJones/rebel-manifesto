Quebec - The Minister of Families, Ms. Nicole Léger, is today launching a new call for projects within the framework of the Municipal Family Policy Support Program. This program is aimed at municipalities and regional county municipalities (RCMs) who wish to adapt their services to the reality of families in their territory and thus better meet their needs.
“A municipal family policy is a project that ensures that the needs of families are taken into account in all directions likely to affect them. Municipalities thus become more attractive to families, and the entire community benefits from services better suited to the needs of the population, ”said Minister Nicole Léger.
The implementation of a family policy promotes consideration of the needs of families in all areas of intervention, be it safety, transport, housing or even culture and Hobbies. In 2014-2015, an envelope of $ 885,000 is available for municipalities and RCMs wishing to take advantage of this program.
In Quebec, to date, 703 municipalities and 27 RCMs have adopted such a policy or are in the process of doing so, so that 86% of the Quebec population lives in a municipality committed to this program.
Information documents and application forms under the Financial Support Program for Municipal Family Policies are available on the website of the Ministère de la Famille, at www..mfa.gouv.qc.ca. The call for projects ends on April 17, 2014.
