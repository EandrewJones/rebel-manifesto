Quebec - The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Member of Parliament for Jonquière, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, is pleased to announce the negotiation of long-term leases with the MRC Robert-Cliche, the MRC de La Nouvelle-Beauce as well as the MRC de Beauce-Sartigan, with a view to the use for recreational and tourism purposes of the abandoned railway right-of-way, between Vallée-Jonction and Notre-Dame-des-Pins, in the region of Chaudière-Appalaches.
“The authorization to build a cycle path on this abandoned portion of the right-of-way of the Chemin de fer Québec Central (CFQC), of the Chaudière subdivision, meets a demand from the community since 2007. This is the first necessary step. so that the project requested by the community can be carried out, ”said Minister Sylvain Gaudreault.
Remember that, last year, the Regional Conference of Elected Officials (CRÉ) of Chaudière-Appalaches and Estrie made public the results of an external study on the commercial potential of the CFQC. The CRÉ recommended in particular the use of certain sections for recreational tourism purposes.
“When I learned of the desire to develop a bicycle path in the railway right-of-way between Vallée-Jonction and Notre-Dame-des-Pins, I wanted to make sure I knew all the implications of such a authorization. However, the study shows the low potential for profitability of this section for its use for railway purposes. Subsequently, I wanted to see what we could do in relation to their request, ”explained the Minister.
“Before people can move forward with their project, there has to be this type of negotiation. So this is an important step forward for the players in the file, ”concludes the Minister.
