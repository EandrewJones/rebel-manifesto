Montreal - “An initial review of public finances indicates that the risks to the fiscal situation are more serious than my predecessor had suggested. However, this does not prevent us from reaffirming the government&#39;s commitment to respect the budgetary objectives ”, declared today the Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau, in the presence of the Minister responsible for the Administration. government and President of the Treasury Board, Stéphane Bédard, when tabling the Monthly Financial Operations Report as of June 30, 2012.
Minister Marceau recalled that the adoption of the Balanced Budget Act and the achievement of a zero deficit are two achievements of a Parti Québécois government. &quot;Even if the financial data as of June 30 already show a deficit of $ 1,517 million after three months, the forecast of the budgetary balance for 2012-2013 is maintained at $ 1.5 billion,&quot; he indicated.
The Minister specified that the risks surrounding the government&#39;s financial situation already identified by the former government are greater in terms of both expenditure and income. “The spending overruns, which Raymond Bachand had estimated at $ 800 million, are actually $ 1.1 billion. In addition, its forecast for economic growth was overstated, which also puts pressure on revenues in the order of $ 500 million. In total, the risks therefore amount to $ 1.6 billion, ”he added. However, he reaffirmed the government&#39;s firm commitment to achieving the budgetary target set for this year and the return to financial balance as of next year.
In addition, the President of the Treasury Board, Mr. Stéphane Bédard, indicated that all the departments were called upon to respect the spending objectives that were set for them for 2012-2013. “Departments and agencies have already been informed that they will have to meet the 2.0% spending increase target. Our government has always been the party of the zero deficit, and we intend once again to take the means to achieve it, despite the state of public finances left by the previous government. &quot;
Mr. Bédard also specified that, due to the cost overruns observed for several capital projects carried out in recent years, the government intends to examine the entire process of managing and approving the infrastructure spending of the Government of Quebec. The government asked Infrastructure Quebec to give a mandate to an external firm to audit infrastructure projects.
&quot;I will complete my review of public finances in the coming weeks, and we will be releasing an update on Quebec&#39;s economic and financial situation later this fall,&quot; concluded the Minister of Finance and the Economy.
