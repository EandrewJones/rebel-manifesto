Quebec - The Minister for Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, the Canadian Francophonie and Sovereignty Governance, Mr. Alexandre Cloutier, and the Minister of Natural Resources, Ms. Martine Ouellet, denounce the adoption of motion M-412 which dealt with the loan guarantee granted by the federal government to the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador for the Lower Churchill hydroelectric project, by Members of the Federal Parliament.
Following the passage of this motion, the Government of Quebec regrets that the federal parliament and the members of Quebec from the New Democratic Party (NDP), the Liberal Party of Canada (PLQ) and the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) have voted against Quebec by supporting a project that goes against Quebec&#39;s interests.
“The federal government is going to finance hydroelectricity in Newfoundland while Quebeckers have always paid for their electricity themselves. It is unacceptable, it is the taxes of Quebecers that will be used to create unfair competition at Hydro-Québec, ”said Minister Cloutier.
“It&#39;s indecent, seventy Quebec federal deputies voted for a motion welcoming the granting of a loan which allows direct competition with Quebec energy for a project whose profitability is questionable. Quebec federal deputies ignored a unanimous motion from the National Assembly, ”added Minister Martine Ouellet.
There is a Quebec consensus condemning the granting of a federal loan guarantee. A second motion reiterating Quebec&#39;s opposition to federal financial participation in the Lower Churchill hydroelectric project was adopted unanimously last November in the National Assembly.
