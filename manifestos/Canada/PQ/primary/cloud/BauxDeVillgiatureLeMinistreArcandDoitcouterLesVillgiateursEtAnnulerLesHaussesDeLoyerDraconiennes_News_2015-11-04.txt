Quebec - With the support of several owners of cottages built on public land in Quebec, the member for Bonaventure and Parti Québécois spokesperson for forests, wildlife and parks, Sylvain Roy, once again urges the Minister of Natural Resources, Pierre Arcand, to cancel the huge rent increases for resort leases.
“This is a strong message sent to the government by thousands of citizens who value the accessibility of public lands in Quebec, without discrimination as to their income or their social status. Several thousand vacationers have signed the petition to demand, on the one hand, the cancellation of the increases decreed by the Liberal government - which can, in some cases, reach 530% - and, on the other hand, that Minister Arcand s &#39;ensures to avoid a return to private clubs, abolished in Quebec at the end of the 1970s by Yves Duhaime and the Parti Québécois. The Minister must listen to the message sent by these thousands of citizens and announce that he is definitively renouncing the increases, ”insisted the deputy.
Sylvain Roy also demands that the Minister sit down with the various stakeholders in the resort sector in order to put in place long-term solutions guaranteeing the maintenance of the accessibility of lands in the domain of the State to all Quebecers. .
“The players in the field have interesting proposals that deserve to be taken into account by the government. Millions of Quebecers enjoy vacationing and outdoor activities. These therefore have significant economic spinoffs in all regions. The Minister must assume his responsibilities and reassure the citizens of Quebec that they will be able to continue to take advantage of their own territory, ”the MP concluded.
