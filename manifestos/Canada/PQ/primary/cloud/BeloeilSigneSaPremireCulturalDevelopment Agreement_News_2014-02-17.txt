Beloeil - On behalf of the Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, the Minister of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology and Member of Parliament for Borduas, Pierre Duchesne, announces the signing of an agreement of cultural development with the City of Beloeil. This agreement includes financial commitments totaling $ 163,500 over three years and may support various sectors of cultural activity.
“This first agreement will allow creators of Beloeil and the surrounding area to share their passion with their fellow citizens and it will contribute to better access to culture and the arts. Such an agreement could serve as a vehicle to increase artistic practice but also the enhancement of heritage in the territory, ”said Maka Kotto.
The contribution from the Ministère de la Culture et des Communications, for the duration of the 2013-2016 agreement, is $ 75,000, while that of the City of Beloeil is $ 88,500. This agreement aims to carry out 16 actions related to the objectives pursued by the City in the visual arts, media arts, performing arts and heritage sectors. These objectives aim to mobilize the population through cultural mediation, to promote the participation of cultural resources by opening up to new cultural practices and to enhance the heritage with interpretation circuits.
“Culture carries identity and stimulates creativity, while constituting a powerful lever for socio-economic progress. The City of Beloeil has understood this and, in recent years, its cultural efforts have been remarkable. These led to the happy ending that we know today. In addition, the 2013-2015 cultural action plan that the City is making public today is another example, ”said Pierre Duchesne.
The resulting actions are directly linked to the principles of Agenda 21 for culture in Quebec: the concertation of resources, citizen participation and sustainable development. For more information related to Agenda 21, see http://www.agenda21c.gouv.qc.ca/.
