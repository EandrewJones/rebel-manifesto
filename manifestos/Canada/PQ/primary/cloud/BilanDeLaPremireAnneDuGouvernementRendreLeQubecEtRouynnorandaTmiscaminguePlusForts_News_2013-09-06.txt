Rouyn-Noranda– One year to the day since his election as Member of Parliament, Gilles Chapadeau presents the results of his work for Rouyn-Noranda and Témiscamingue.
“It is an honor and a great pride for me to work every day for the people of Rouyn-Noranda and Témiscamingue. All my life, I have made it a duty and a responsibility to be accountable for my work and to communicate transparently all of my actions. It is therefore quite natural for me to do so as a Member of Parliament, ”explains Mr. Chapadeau.
“As I am a man of action, it is under this theme that I take stock of my first year. Things have changed since September 4, 2012, our government has been active on several fronts at the same time. I think that like many, I was hungry for change after nine years of Liberal rule, ”said the MP.
“I am convinced that this exercise will be one in a long series, because I deeply believe that elected officials have a duty to account for their actions towards the citizens they represent. I went into politics to work with rigor and integrity in the interest of the people of our region and I believe that actions like the one I am taking today with this record bear witness to this, ”emphasizes Gilles Chapadeau.
