Chibougamau - The deputy of Ungava, Mr. Luc Ferland is very happy with the results of the first year of his government. Much has been accomplished. Pauline Marois became the first woman elected Premier of Quebec on September 4, 2012. Her government&#39;s first year in office is marked by listening, courage and determination. Today, the Government of Quebec once again has the means to act so that Quebeckers regain their pride. The priorities are clear: the economy and job creation, solidarity and help to those in need, and the pride of living together. The Parti Québécois government will therefore take all the necessary actions to make Quebec stronger.
“Our government has made great changes by making our riding an important place. I am particularly proud of the adoption of Bill 42 on the creation of the Eeyou Istchee Baie-James Regional Government, which ensures that a Jamesian and Cree structure will be put in place and adapted to the current issues and challenges of the territory. , as well as a municipal management structure of a public nature, explicitly providing for indigenous and non-indigenous representation, which is an important step in a dynamic, harmonious and respectful nation-to-nation relationship, ”explained Mr. Ferland.
In addition, as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Natural Resources (Nordic Affairs Section), Martine Ouellet, Mr. Ferland is delighted with the creation of the Secretariat for Northern Development.
Also, Quebec as a whole wins in terms of ethics, prosperity and solidarity.
