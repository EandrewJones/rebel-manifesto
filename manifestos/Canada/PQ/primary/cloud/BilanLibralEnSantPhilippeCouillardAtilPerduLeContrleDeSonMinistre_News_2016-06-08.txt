Quebec– Diane Lamarre, Member of Parliament for Taillon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of health and accessibility to care, draws up a pitiful assessment of this parliamentary session for patients.
The liberal record is:
“We are forced to note the lamentable failure of Minister Barrette who, despite his strong methods and his despotism, only harms access for patients. Another session &quot;all for doctors, cuts in patient services,&quot; &quot;denounced Diane Lamarre.
“After having abolished all the associations of establishments - which he considered to be discordant and disturbing voices, but who were, in fact, vigilant evaluators who gave us the facts on the ground - here is that the Minister is attacked the last watchdog of the network, the Commissioner for Health and Welfare, created by Philippe Couillard himself when he was Minister of Health. Why muzzle criticism in this way? If he is so confident about his reforms, Minister Barrette should not be afraid that they will be evaluated, ”added the spokesperson.
“For its part, the Parti Québécois was proactive and this spring tabled Bill 691 in order to remove the regulatory power given to himself by Minister Barrette to dictate a list of ancillary costs to be paid by patients. We also advocated for better use of other frontline professionals, including psychologists, paramedics, social workers, nurses and pharmacists. And we demanded the maintenance of the SABSA clinic ”, also recalled the deputy.
“How is it that Philippe Couillard lets Gaétan Barrette destroy our public health network in this way? Has he lost control of his omnipotent minister? We can do so much better. The solutions exist and would have yielded results, but the model imposed by the minister is disconnected from the people, costly and without tangible results for the patients. One thing is certain: we will continue our work with rigor and vigilance to provide solutions that are truly citizen-oriented, ”concluded the MP.
