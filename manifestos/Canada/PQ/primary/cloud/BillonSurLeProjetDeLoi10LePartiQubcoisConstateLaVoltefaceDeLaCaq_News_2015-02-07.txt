Quebec - The Member of Parliament for Taschereau and House Leader of the Official Opposition, Agnès Maltais, notes the about-face of the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) on Bill 10 by Minister Gaétan Barrette.
&quot;Having enthusiastically supported the minister since the tabling of his bill last September, the CAQ members finally gave in to the arguments conveyed by the groups met and by the Parti Québécois, according to which the minister&#39;s bill Barrette does not respond to any of the concerns of Quebeckers in terms of the efficiency of the health system, ”declared the MP.
Indeed, this morning, the spokesperson for the CAQ, François Paradis, finally admitted that the government&#39;s bill does not provide a solution to improve the governance of the Quebec health system, and declared that his party was considering to vote against.
“After calling for the multiplication of CISSSs throughout the detailed study of Bill 10, the CAQ and its new spokesperson, François Paradis, finally noted the minister&#39;s inability to demonstrate the usefulness of the new structures. that he proposes. Finally, after unconditionally supporting the Liberal austerity program that he himself inspired, the leader of the CAQ opposes one of the counterproductive measures that the government has presented since taking office. We hope that at least this time, the CAQ will stay the course and vote against this bad bill at the conclusion of the gag, ”added Agnès Maltais.
