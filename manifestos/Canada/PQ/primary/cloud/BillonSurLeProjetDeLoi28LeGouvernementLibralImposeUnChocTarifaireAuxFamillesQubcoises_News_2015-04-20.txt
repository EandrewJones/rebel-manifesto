Quebec - The member for Terrebonne and official opposition critic for family matters, Mathieu Traversy, denounces the gag order of Bill 28, which will cause child care services to cost up to $ 20 per day, a price shock of several thousand dollars per year for middle-class families in Quebec.
The MP points out that, like Bill 10, also adopted under gag order, we do not know how the reform imposed by Bill 28 will apply. “The government has not explained anything to Quebecers. Obviously, Philippe Couillard and his ministers are improvising, ”he declared.
“What is more, the government is breaking another electoral promise, which had undertaken to limit the increase in tariffs to indexation. Moreover, he has never explained to the parents how his new family tax will be calculated. What will happen, for example, for the reconstituted couples? The clause-by-clause study would have answered this question and many others, but the government refused to complete it, preferring to impose a gag order. Neither the Minister of Finance nor the Minister of Families were able to answer our questions today, ”continued Mathieu Traversy.
The member also deplores that at the start of the detailed accelerated study this afternoon, the government pushed its bad faith to the point of refusing to deal as a priority with Chapter VI, which deals with childcare services. “Unfortunately, Quebec families will have no answer; they will only get the assurance that they will have to pay a new liberal family tax, without knowing the amount or how it will be calculated, ”he concluded.
