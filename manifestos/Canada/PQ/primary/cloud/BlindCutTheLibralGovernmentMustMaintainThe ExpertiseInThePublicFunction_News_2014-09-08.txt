Quebec - The Parti Québécois calls on the Liberal government to continue the work begun when it was in power to rebuild expertise in the Quebec public service.
“The loss of expertise results in additional costs for the state and for citizens. Government cuts must not affect the foundations of the efficiency of our services. Quebec must be able to carry out its missions in the interest and while respecting the means of its citizens, ”declared the member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard.
The obligation to resort to private firms has resulted in exorbitant additional costs in several projects, whether in transport or IT. The Parti Québécois hopes that the work it has undertaken as a government will continue.
&quot;The Quebec state needs engineers to carry out its road projects, computer specialists for its operation, as well as wildlife officers and biologists to conserve its forest and ensure the well-being of animal species,&quot; added the official opposition spokesperson for the Treasury Board and information technologies, Élaine Zakaïb. Recent cuts to the wildlife sector do not bode well. The State must be able to fulfill its mandates, which include the conservation of its territory, ”she said.
For his part, the Member of Parliament for Rimouski, Harold LeBel, believes that the Rimouski IT center of expertise is a fine example of the decentralization of jobs in the public service, in addition to playing a leading role in rebuilding expertise.
“The Parti Québécois is the party of regions, and the creation of a center of expertise in Bas-Saint-Laurent is a concrete illustration of this. Will the Liberal government cut these jobs in the regions? It would demonstrate once again that it has no vision or plan for the economic development of the regions of Quebec, ”concluded the MP.
