Quebec– Mathieu Traversy, spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of sustainable development, the environment and the fight against climate change, calls on the Minister of the Environment, David Heurtel, to protect the natural heritage of the Boisé des Hirondelles de Saint -Bruno-de-Montarville, not to protect the real estate assets of a private developer.
The member for Terrebonne reminds the minister of his own decision of July 2015 concerning the real estate development planned in this sector. David Heurtel then fully endorsed the detailed scientific opinion of his officials, concluding that &quot;the intervention planned by the real estate developer risks severely degrading a natural environment which is distinguished by the fact that its characteristics favor the survival of ginseng with five leaflets, a rare biophysical characteristic of exceptional interest ”.
“The Minister must be consistent with his 2015 decision and declare that the planned real estate development would be incompatible with the protection of this plant species. Its role is to base its decision on the best scientific information available, ”said Mathieu Traversy.
The member also points out that Quebec has laws that protect our natural heritage. “David Heurtel must enforce laws aimed at preserving natural environments. Giving the green light to this project would mean that it hardly cares about the protection of our biodiversity, ”he continued.
Mathieu Traversy adds that real estate development in the Boisé des Hirondelles would be incompatible with the declared will of citizens, environmental organizations and elected officials of the greater Montreal area to set up a green and blue belt to connect the natural environments together. “David Heurtel must not fragment natural environments. Giving authorization for this real estate development would further compromise the development of a green and blue belt, ”he concluded.
