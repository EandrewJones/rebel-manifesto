Quebec - The leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, has once again called on Liberal Prime Minister Philippe Couillard to make public the details of the agreement reached between the government and Bombardier, after we learned that the he company will relocate even more activities to countries with low production costs, such as Mexico, Morocco and India.
“This information is rather surprising, given the fact that the Prime Minister claims to have protected jobs in Quebec. Only a few days ago, Philippe Couillard criticized the Caisse de depot for having invested in Bombardier Transport, whose operational headquarters are located in Germany. He forgot to mention that for his part, he financed Bombardier to the tune of 1.3 billion to create jobs in Mexico, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“All of this brings us back to the fact that the agreement between the government and Bombardier has still not been disclosed. Can the Prime Minister tell us whether the announcement made yesterday by Bombardier, which plans to increase its use of low-cost labor abroad, is in accordance with the agreement reached with his government? Added the leader of the official opposition.
He again called for more transparency from the Prime Minister. “This agreement of 1.3 billion, the government obviously did not negotiate it with minimum requirements. Quebecers must know what the government has demanded in return for the investment made on their behalf, ”concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
