Quebec, April 11, 2017 - The Parti Québécois finance spokesperson, Nicolas Marceau, and the economy spokesperson, Alain Therrien, denounced the disinformation maneuver used by the Minister of the Economy, Dominique Anglade, in the matter of the salaries of senior executives at Bombardier and the bonuses paid to them.
IN SHORT
&quot;Yesterday, the minister declared that&quot; Quebeckers will not pay bonuses to Bombardier executives as long as they do not make money [with the CSeries] &quot;. However, in the declaration of significant changes unveiled last night by Bombardier, we have rather confirmation to the contrary: all the executives of the company will receive their bonuses, as planned, from the annual incentive plan. This is almost $ 7 million in bonuses for 2016. And no part of this amount is carried over to 2020! », Explained Nicolas Marceau.
“The Minister confuses long-term variable compensation, based on shares and options, and short-term compensation, made up of salary and annual bonuses. On the executive committee, neither salaries nor annual bonuses have been changed. We rolled in flour. For the past week, Bombardier has been trying to calm popular discontent by making disinformation on the salaries of its senior executives. Last week, the Prime Minister said he was satisfied with the announced measure. Yesterday, the Minister of the Economy said that as long as Quebeckers did not make money, senior leaders would not get a raise. When will the Liberal government stop protecting the richest 1%? “, For his part asked Alain Therrien.
