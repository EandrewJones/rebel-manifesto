Quebec - While we learn that the Liberal government of Philippe Couillard has decided to invest a billion dollars, with Bombardier, in the C Series program, the leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, deplores that the Liberals have chosen to make Quebeckers assume all the risks.
The money will be invested in a new corporate shell specifically created to receive government money, rather than the parent company. Thus, the Liberal government is giving up protecting its investment with the other assets owned by the company. “The problem is that by acting in this way, the government is preparing to make Quebec citizens and taxpayers take all the risks, for the benefit of Bombardier shareholders. It&#39;s an unfair transaction, ”explained Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“Investing in the aeronautics sector is not in itself bad. In fact, I have repeatedly asked the government to take concrete action to protect these paying jobs for Quebeckers. But I never said that the state should take all the risks, ”said the leader of the official opposition.
It should also be noted that neither the federal government nor the Caisse de dépôt et placement are parties to this agreement. “The Prime Minister and his Minister of the Economy signed a very bad deal. They definitely do not understand anything about finance or economics, ”concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
