Quebec - The member for Saint-Jérôme and leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, once again asked for the details of the agreement signed by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Philippe Couillard in the Bombardier file.
“Last week the government announced a $ 1.3 billion investment in a new joint venture formed with Bombardier, but which will only include the struggling C Series program. So $ 1.3 billion will be invested in a corporate shell with no income, while this billion represents a third of Bombardier&#39;s market capitalization. While austerity reigns everywhere in Quebec, the critics are unanimous: it is a bad deal and it is Quebecers who will take all the risks, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
&quot;By consulting the register of insider reports, we learn that on October 5, three weeks before the Prime Minister&#39;s announcement, 12 Bombardier directors received more than 373,000 subscription rights at a price 30% lower than that obtained by the government. These directors will therefore pocket a quarter of a million dollars before the government can make a single penny with its own subscription rights. How does the Prime Minister explain this double standard, two measures in favor of the directors of Bombardier? How does he explain that the government warrants were not obtained at the current market price, as was the case for the directors of Bombardier? », Continued the leader of the official opposition.
Pierre Karl Péladeau reminds that several questions remain, in particular:
What are the government&#39;s rights under the shareholders agreement?
What are their rights with regard to the appointment of directors?
“Quebeckers are asking these questions, they have the right to know. The Prime Minister must make the agreement public, ”he concluded.
