Quebec - In the Bombardier case, the leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, judges that the Prime Minister is showing a flagrant lack of respect towards Quebecers.
“As incredible as it may seem, the Liberal government of Philippe Couillard invested $ 1.3 billion in Bombardier, but without asking for anything in return from the company. A few weeks later, Bombardier announced 2,400 layoffs in Quebec, without even having bothered to inform the government. In addition, the government has dropped its recourse to enforce the law regarding the maintenance of Air Canada maintenance activities in Quebec, at the same time abandoning the 1,800 Aveos workers ”, recalled the head of the Air Canada. official opposition.
“Yesterday, we were told that after accepting the government&#39;s money, Bombardier will close its flight test center at CSeries, the very division in which the government is a partner. So there are only two possible options: either the government, a 49.5% partner of the CSeries, has no decision-making weight in the company and makes people laugh at it, or it has decision-making power. , and he approved this transfer of jobs from Quebec to Kansas, despite the large sum invested by Quebecers. The Prime Minister was unable to tell us whether his government, which owns nearly half of the shares of CSeries and which sits on the board of directors of Bombardier, approved the closure of the flight test center and its transfer to the United States. However, it is his duty to keep the population informed, ”concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
