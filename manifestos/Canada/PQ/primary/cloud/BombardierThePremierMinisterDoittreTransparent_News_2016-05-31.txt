Quebec - Leader of the Official Opposition and Member of Parliament for Jonquière, Sylvain Gaudreault, has called for greater transparency from Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard regarding the $ 1.3 billion in assistance his government has granted to Bombardier .
“Regarding the agreement that the government has concluded with the company, we know that it holds an option on 200 million warrants, but we do not know what are the redemption conditions related to the billion it has invested. However, this morning, we learned that the redemption conditions could be as low as an interest rate of 3% or 4%, which would mean, in short, that it is the taxpayers who take all the risks. If things go wrong, they will bear the consequences but, if all goes well, they will have no possibility of profiting from the gains, ”declared Sylvain Gaudreault.
&quot;There are only two possible options: either the terms of redemption were agreed from the start - in this case, the Prime Minister must be transparent, because it is taxpayers&#39; money - or Philippe Couillard must admit that the situation is worse than we thought and that he improvised, using a billion of public money. The Prime Minister is not even in a position to tell Quebeckers what their profit will be if all goes well and the company decides to buy out the government&#39;s share. What we do know, however, is that we will lose everything if things go badly, ”he added.
“In October, when the government announced that it would financially support Bombardier, everyone agreed. The problem is that the deal was badly negotiated. The deadline for concluding its final version has long expired. The date for the first payment has passed for two months, and the federal government is still waiting. What is Prime Minister Couillard waiting for to really put pressure on Ottawa in order to obtain our share of the $ 50 billion that Quebeckers send there each year? », Concluded the leader of the official opposition.
