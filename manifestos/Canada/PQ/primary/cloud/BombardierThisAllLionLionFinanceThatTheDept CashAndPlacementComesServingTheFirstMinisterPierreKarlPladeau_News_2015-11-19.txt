Quebec - In reaction to the announcement made jointly this morning by the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec and Bombardier, the leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, considers that this agreement proves that the Liberal Prime Minister Philippe Couillard and his government do not have the economic or financial competence to run Quebec.
“Rather than assume all the risks in the C Series program - and invest in a developing program that does not include any guaranteed return, as the government has done - the depositors of the Caisse, c &#39; i.e. the vast majority of Quebecers who contribute to the Régie des rentes, will be guaranteed a return of at least 9.5% and obtain the increase in value of a company that generates more than 6 billion in revenue and over $ 600 million in operating profits. The Caisse has just given the Minister of the Economy a whole lesson in finance. The Prime Minister says that the Caisse will support jobs in Germany and not in Quebec. However, last May Bombardier Transportation employed more than 1,300 people in La Pocatière and Saint-Bruno. Does Philippe Couillard ignore it? “, Wondered the leader of the official opposition.
“While all the details of the agreement reached by the Caisse were announced this morning, we still do not have the beginning of a detail on the one reached by the government for the C Series. The Prime Minister prided himself on being transparent; when will he release the details of this transaction to the public? Added the leader of the official opposition.
&quot;The only information that the Prime Minister gave us on his investment of 1.3 billion is that it was done in secret, by his Minister of the Economy, without the expertise required for a transaction as well. sophisticated. In light of the investment announced by the Caisse, the Prime Minister must tell us how he can maintain his confidence in his minister, ”concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
