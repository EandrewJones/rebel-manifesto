Quebec– The Leader of the Official Opposition and Member of Parliament for Jonquière, Sylvain Gaudreault, is happy to wish a Happy National Day to all Quebecers.
&quot;The national holiday is the best opportunity to fraternize, to share what unites us and to proudly express our belonging to Quebec and to this magnificent nation that is ours,&quot; declared the leader of the official opposition.
This year, our national holiday takes place under the theme of Quebec, pure art. “Like language, art expresses the personality and soul of a nation. Through more than 400 years of history, Quebec artists have been able to translate - through texts, paintings, on stage and on screen - our joys, our sorrows, our hopes and our dreams. Today, the creative genius of Quebecers shines and is rewarded all over the planet, ”he continued.
“I also have a special thought for the thousands of compatriots with an immigrant background who will be celebrating Quebec&#39;s national holiday for the first time. I want to tell them that this holiday is also theirs. On behalf of the entire team of the official opposition and the Parti Québécois, I wish a very happy national holiday to all Quebecers, ”concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
