Quebec - Here is the message sent to Quebecers by Premier Pauline Marois on the occasion of the National Day:
“In 1977, René Lévesque wanted to give an official character to Saint-Jean-Baptiste. He wanted to offer it to all Quebecers, whatever their origin or their beliefs. He made it the national holiday of Quebecers.
This is what we now emphasize on June 24 of each year. We celebrate this bond which, from yesterday to tomorrow, unites all the citizens of Quebec.
This link is first and foremost the pride of a past of resistance and success. Whether it is through the works of our artists or the genius of our inventors, our voice has resonated in French all over the world.
It is also a present lived through our talents, our creativity and our originality. We are a proud, prosperous and united people who never cease to amaze and who are able to join the universal thanks to their humanist values.
It is also a future of all possibilities. The 21st century has only just begun and it is already announcing great challenges and many opportunities to be seized.
A new world is offered to us. You have to embrace it.
The greatest achievement in our history is the awareness that nothing is forbidden to us.
Our children can grow up with the conviction that their ambitions and hopes will know no bounds. Like the great nation of which they are a part.
On June 24, as day wins over night, here is what we are celebrating: A story that unites us and a destiny that unites us!
I wish you a happy national day! &quot;
