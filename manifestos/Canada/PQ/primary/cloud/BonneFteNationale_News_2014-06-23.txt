Quebec - The member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, sends his best wishes to Quebecers on the occasion of Quebec&#39;s national holiday.
“On behalf of the entire Parti Québécois team, I wish Quebeckers a very happy national holiday. It is undoubtedly an opportunity to celebrate our identity and, in particular, the French language which is its foundation. This language resonates in our regions, our metropolis and our capital, but also throughout the world. For centuries, we have preserved this precious heritage. Let us continue to honor it, to show ourselves worthy of it.
We are a proud, prosperous and united people. Our history is rich in successes and it unites all the citizens of Quebec. We would also like this story to be taught and disseminated more. To know where you want to go, the best way is to know where you come from!
The national holiday is also an opportunity to celebrate our collective successes, those which make our nation shine on the international scene. Quebecers are talented and creative; these qualities allow us to stand out and to illustrate ourselves all over the world.
I invite the entire population to participate in the many festivities that will take place in all regions of Quebec. Let&#39;s take this opportunity to come together and celebrate our history and our future! », Declared Stéphane Bédard.
