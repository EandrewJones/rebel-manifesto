Quebec - “I am very proud today to announce that our government is resolutely turning the corner on home care in order to allow all adults, both seniors whose autonomy is diminished and people in search of autonomy, to have the freedom to choose where they wish to receive the health care required by their condition. Autonomy insurance is offering this choice to Quebecers. This is what the Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, declared today, who released the white paper Autonomie pour tous, in the company of the Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Seniors, Réjean Hébert.
Quebec is the second state with the fastest aging population in the world, after Japan. “Given the situation, more and more people are seeing their autonomy diminish. In order to face the challenge posed by this reality, it appears essential to rethink our model of providing care and services, and to turn to home care, which will be precisely what autonomy insurance will allow ”, share said Minister Hébert.
A parliamentary committee will look into the matter in early autumn. It will be an opportunity to discuss the possible solutions proposed in the white paper to face the challenge of an aging population and to respond to the desire of the elderly to be able to age at home. The government then intends to present a bill relating to autonomy insurance, which it wishes to have adopted before the end of the year.
