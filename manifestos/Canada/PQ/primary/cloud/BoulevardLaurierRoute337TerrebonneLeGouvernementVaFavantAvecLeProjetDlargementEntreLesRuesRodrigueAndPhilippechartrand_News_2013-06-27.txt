Terrebonne– The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announced today, in the presence of the MP for Masson, Ms. Diane Gadoury-Hamelin, that the studies prior to defining the widening of a section of Route 337, between Rodrigue and Philippe-Chartrand streets in Terrebonne, will be completed in 2013.
&quot;With this announcement, I would like to assure the citizens of Terrebonne of the government&#39;s commitment to this widening project of some 500 meters, which will improve the flow of traffic on Route 337, in the La Plaine sector of Terrebonne&quot;, specified Minister Sylvain Gaudreault.
The current traffic and geometry analysis will make it possible to define the preferred layout to ensure the functionality of Route 337. The number of lanes, the required extent of the improvements and the need for the addition of turning lanes are elements to be defined. “The study not only takes into account the 35,000 or so vehicles that use route 337 south of rue Philippe-Chartrand daily, but also traffic movements on adjacent streets,” added Mr. Gaudreault.
“Our government has heard the needs of a region benefiting from sustained population growth. My colleague Mathieu Traversy, Member of Parliament for Terrebonne, shares my enthusiasm for today&#39;s announcement, which was eagerly awaited by the community, ”declared Diane Gadoury-Hamelin, Member of Parliament for Masson.
The preliminary design will be completed by the end of 2013. It is at this stage that the timetable and the amount of the investment can be specified.
