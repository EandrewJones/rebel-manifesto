Quebec - By announcing today the details of the Commitment of services for employment and for &quot;nobody escaping&quot;, the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women , Ms. Agnès Maltais, indicated that special attention will be paid to young recipients of last resort financial assistance so that the benefit period is only a transition to employment.
In the Ministry&#39;s commitment, young people seeking social assistance under the age of 25 will be proactively supported. Emploi-Québec will intervene quickly and systematically with them. They will be met upon their first request for financial assistance and regular follow-up will be undertaken in order to support them.
In 2012, each month, approximately 2,500 young people under the age of 25 applied for financial assistance from the social assistance program. Of these, two in three grew up in a family enrolled in a social assistance program. This proportion reaches three out of four young people for beneficiaries under the age of 21. This is a significant loss in human capital, especially since 700,000 jobs will be available in Quebec by 2016.
“Our goal is to break the cycle of poverty and that is why young people will be met. Starting your adult life on social assistance is not a desirable path. I have too much faith in our youth not to try everything so that a transition to financial aid is only a brief accident. We must support them so that they can take control of their lives, ”explained Minister Maltais.
This new way of intervening with young beneficiaries updates the assistance provided to them in order to make it coherent with the new realities of the labor market which have continued to evolve since the beginning of the application of the Law on income security in 1989.
