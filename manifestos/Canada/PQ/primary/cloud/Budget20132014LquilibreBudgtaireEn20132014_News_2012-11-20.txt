Quebec - The Minister of Finance and the Economy, Nicolas Marceau, today tabled a balanced budget for 2013-2014. “Quebec finally has a balanced budget after four years of deficits,” he proudly declared.
“To achieve this objective, however, adjustments are necessary since we inherited a significant budgetary impasse for the years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. To let it go would have been unworthy of responsible government. We are therefore taking the necessary actions now to achieve a balance in 2013-2014 and maintain it thereafter, ”said the Minister.
“In recent weeks, the government has updated its financial framework and has taken action to resolve the $ 1.6 billion impasse for 2012-2013. We have asked departments and agencies to find solutions and initiate the necessary controls to meet the spending targets established last March. Similarly, this budget forecasts that growth in program spending will be limited to 1.8% for 2013-2014 and 2.4% for 2014-2015. However, we provide funding for major State missions. The health care budget will continue to grow at a rate of 4.8% per year. The education budget will increase by 1.8% and that of higher education by 2.0% for 2013-2014 ”, announced the Minister.
He stressed that the entire government apparatus is involved in achieving a balanced budget, including organizations and special funds. “We will also ask government corporations to make significant efforts. The Société des alcools du Québec, Loto-Québec and Hydro-Québec will be involved. For example, Hydro-Québec will have to take action to improve its efficiency. It will therefore reduce its operating costs in the short term by eliminating 2,000 jobs through attrition. This improvement in the performance of the Crown corporation will not affect services to consumers. Additional efforts by government corporations will total $ 290 million in 2013-2014, ”said the Minister.
“In addition, the Auditor General of Quebec will now be able to perform value-for-money audits in government enterprises and their subsidiaries. It will thus be able to ensure that government corporations manage more rigorously the resources that belong to all Quebecers, ”he added.
The minister also announced measures to reduce tax expenditures. These actions consist in suspending two measures announced in the last two budgets concerning experienced workers, and in including in the calculation of taxable income all refundable tax credits intended for businesses. These tightening will increase government revenue by $ 68 million in 2013-2014 and $ 115 million in 2014-2015.
Finally, he indicated that the intensification of the fight against tax evasion will make it possible to recover $ 80 million more in 2013-2014, bringing the objective to $ 3,866 million.
The minister announced that the level of overall capital investment will be set at a maximum of $ 9.5 billion per year on average over the next five years. This decision will result in savings of $ 200 million in reduced amortization and interest expenses in 2014-2015 and even more thereafter.
“We will ask the banks and other financial institutions to continue and increase their contribution to efforts to restore fiscal balance. The contribution of financial institutions, which was to end in 2014, will be increased and extended until March 31, 2019. Revenues of $ 80 million in 2013-2014 and $ 211 million in 2014-2015 will thus be generated ”, specified the minister.
In addition, the specific tax on tobacco will be increased by 2 ¢ per cigarette. This increase will represent 50 ¢ per pack or $ 4 per cartridge. The specific tax on alcoholic beverages will also be increased. The increase for a bottle of beer will be 3 ¢, that for a bottle of wine, 17 ¢, and that for a bottle of spirits, 26 ¢. These two increases will bring in respectively $ 130 million and $ 100 million per year from 2013-2014.
“The government&#39;s efforts to balance the finances of the Quebec nation are hampered by unilateral decisions taken by the federal government in recent years. In fact, we are witnessing a decline of ten years, when all of Quebec was mobilized to eliminate the fiscal imbalance. The decisions of 2008, with regard to the equalization program, and of 2011, with regard to the Canada Health Transfer, had and will continue to have negative consequences on Quebec&#39;s public finances, ”he added. denounced the minister.
He asked the federal government, on the one hand, to reverse its decision to impose ceilings on the equalization program and, on the other hand, to gradually increase to 25%, within ten years, its share of the financing of health expenditure. The minister also deplored the federal government&#39;s refusal to follow up on a long-standing demand by Quebec, namely to reduce the Canada transfer to social programs, at a minimum, to its 1994-1995 level, taking into account the &#39;inflation. He noted that the federal disengagement in this matter represents a shortfall of $ 800 million per year.
“One of the paths that the government must follow is that of administering our public finances with integrity and a great sense of responsibility in order to preserve our capacity to act collectively. The government&#39;s sound financial health creates a climate conducive to economic development. It fosters business confidence, encourages their development and provides the population with the quality public services to which it aspires. Everyone benefits from sound management of public finances, all of us and future generations, ”the Minister concluded.
