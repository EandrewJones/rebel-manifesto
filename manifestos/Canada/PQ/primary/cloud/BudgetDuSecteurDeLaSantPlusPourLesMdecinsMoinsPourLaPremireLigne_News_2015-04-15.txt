Québec, April 15, 2015- The member for Taillon and official opposition spokesperson for health and access to care, Diane Lamarre, once again questioned Minister Gaétan Barrette about the fact that the increase in health spending, provided for in the last Liberal budget, which is mainly devoted to the remuneration of physicians.
“In the budget tabled on March 26 by the Minister of Finance, we realize that choices have been made: in health, more than half of the budget increase is devoted to doctors&#39; salaries, rather than to healthcare and services for patients. Thus, 10,000 medical specialists will share $ 210 million, and the 8 million Quebecers will only be entitled to $ 208 million; the disproportion is flagrant! To pay medical specialists, we are cutting direct services to patients, in the first line, ”denounced Diane Lamarre.
“How does the Minister of Health explain that in times of austerity, instead of giving priority to patients in Quebec, he chose to grant a salary increase to his fellow specialists? She added.
“Selective austerity, liberal management, that&#39;s it: we pay medical specialists first, then we give the rest to the first line and to the patients. The minister was unable to tell us why he is providing so little money for direct patient care and services, home care, community organizations. The government cuts in public health, in prevention, it cuts the budget of health establishments. It cuts to home care, so in the first line; these are facts! For the Minister, it is the colleagues first, then the patients, ”concluded Diane Lamarre.
