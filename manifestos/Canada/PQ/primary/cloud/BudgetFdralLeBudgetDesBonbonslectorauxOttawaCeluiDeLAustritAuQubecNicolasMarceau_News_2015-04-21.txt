Quebec - The member for Rousseau and official opposition critic for finance and revenue, Nicolas Marceau, denounces the fact that the federal government&#39;s budget does not take Quebec&#39;s priorities into account.
“The federal budget confirms the paradox between the two levels of government. We have just voted for the austerity budget here in Quebec; this budget will have real consequences for services to Quebecers and will stifle our economic growth. Meanwhile, in Ottawa, it&#39;s the election candy budget. The contrast is striking. The federal government acts in favor of its electoral base; he has no interest in Quebec. The federal Parliament functions without any Quebec influence, ”declared Nicolas Marceau.
The MP also deplores that Prime Minister Philippe Couillard has not asked the federal government for anything. “When you don&#39;t ask for anything, you get nothing. It is not surprising to see that Quebec&#39;s demands have been ignored by Ottawa. We should have talked about health transfers, compensation for the firearms registry or the toll on the new Champlain Bridge, for example. The impact of the drop in health transfers will be very significant in Quebec, where the needs are growing, in particular due to the aging of the population, ”concluded the MP.
