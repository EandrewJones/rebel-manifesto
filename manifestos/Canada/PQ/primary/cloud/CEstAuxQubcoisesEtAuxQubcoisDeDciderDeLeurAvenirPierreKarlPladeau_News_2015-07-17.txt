Quebec - Following the remarks of the Premier of British Columbia, Mrs. Christy Clark, on the subject of the independence of Quebec, the Member of Parliament for Saint-Jérôme and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, wishes to reaffirm that decisions on the political future of the nation of Quebec belong to Quebeckers alone.
“The independence movement carries a legitimate project for the emancipation of Quebecers. We are deeply convinced that full political and economic freedom will allow us to enrich ourselves collectively. By being a country, we will be able to make our own decisions and have all our development levers. The future of our nation is not decided in British Columbia, Saskatchewan or elsewhere, it is decided here, in Quebec, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“This project is in no way incompatible with the success of the Canadian provinces. Just as there is no incompatibility between openness to the world and the importance for Quebec to speak with its own voice internationally. I fully intend to continue the dialogue with the entire population of Quebec, but also with our Canadian partners, whenever I have the opportunity to do so, ”he added.
Decisions made by and for Canada
“Moreover, Quebeckers are well aware of the impact of the decisions made by Canada and of the carelessness of Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, who has completely forgotten the interests of Quebecers for the benefit of his attachment to Canadian unity. He accepts that important decisions are taken without even the Quebecers being consulted, ”concluded the leader of the official opposition.
