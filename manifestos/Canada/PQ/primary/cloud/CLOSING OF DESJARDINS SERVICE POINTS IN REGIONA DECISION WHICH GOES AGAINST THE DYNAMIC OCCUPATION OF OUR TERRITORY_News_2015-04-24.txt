Quebec - The member for Gaspé and official opposition spokesperson for regional development, Gaétan Lelièvre, as well as the member for Berthier, André Villeneuve, deplored the decision of the Mouvement Desjardins to close its points of service in Sainte -Béatrix and Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare.
“We join our voices to that of the mayors, as well as to that of the two national organizations representing the municipalities, the UMQ and the FQM. This way of doing things goes against the principle of the dynamic occupation of our territory. Along with destructive liberal policies, this decision by the Mouvement Desjardins adds to a long list of bad news for the regions, ”declared Gaétan Lelièvre.
The member also recalls that these closures are in addition to those in Buckland, Saint-Philémon and Saint-Nazaire, in Bellechasse.
“Sainte-Béatrix and Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, two municipalities in the riding of Berthier, like several others located in the regions, are mobilizing to safeguard their development tools. The closure of their service points could have several negative effects, starting with the economic devitalization of these communities. People, now forced to do their financial transactions in neighboring villages, may also be tempted to do their everyday purchases there, which would greatly affect local commerce, ”added André Villeneuve.
