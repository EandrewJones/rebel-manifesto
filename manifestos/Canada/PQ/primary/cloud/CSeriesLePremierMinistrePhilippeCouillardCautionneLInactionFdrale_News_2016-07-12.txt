Quebec - The member for Sanguinet and spokesman for the Parti Québécois in matters of the economy, Alain Therrien, denounces Prime Minister Philippe Couillard who gives up his arms in supporting the inaction of the federal government for his share of investment in the C Series.
“While everyone is asking the federal government to do its part, Prime Minister Philippe Couillard said the company does not need it now. How can he hope to keep the pressure on? That said, the Liberal Prime Minister, choosing to preserve Canadian unity to the detriment of the interests of Quebecers, did not put pressure on his federal counterpart at all. He preferred to wait, contenting himself with empty words. This time, he outright approved the lack of consideration of the government of Justin Trudeau, ”said Alain Therrien.
“What the Prime Minister&#39;s words mean is that our flagship, a great pride of Quebec, was going to have to wait until the lack of liquidity hit it before hoping for federal help. How much confidence will this inspire in customers and future buyers? For our part, we continue to urge the federal government to invest in the C Series. Quebeckers send $ 50 billion a year to Ottawa, the federal government must absolutely invest a part here, in Bombardier, as it invests generously in the Ontario automotive sector, ”the MP concluded.
