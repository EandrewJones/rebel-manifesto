The leader of the Parti Québécois, Jean-François Lisée, accompanied by the vice-leader, Véronique Hivon, and candidates from the Capitale-Nationale and Chaudière-Appalaches regions, unveiled the Parti Québécois campaign bus , a bus in the image of Quebec!
IN SHORT
“I am very proud to present this unique and daring work to Quebecers. It perfectly illustrates the fact that by October 1, we will not hesitate to think outside the box. To all those who want Quebeckers to believe that this election has been decided in advance, we say this: like our campaign bus, we are going to surprise. We are ambitious. And we are particularly fit! “, Immediately proclaimed Jean-François Lisée.
To set the tone for this campaign, the Parti Québécois called on the multidisciplinary artist from Drummondville Jean-René Douville Tessier. His exploded and complex works invariably catch the eye and provoke thought. The order was simple: innovate, surprise, challenge.
“I am particularly proud that the Parti Québécois offers such a showcase for my art and my artistic approach! The fact that Jean-François Lisée and Véronique Hivon had the audacity to trust an emerging artist could inspire all political parties. I thank them for allowing me to give my vision of what Quebec is today, both that of the city and that of the regions, ”said Jean-René Douville Tessier.
“Jean-René imagined a creative image of all that Quebec is, with its diversity, its cities and villages. And we will be a showcase for Quebec talent. This bus is just like the campaign we want to lead: daring, positive ... and carbon neutral! So, we are making an appointment with Quebeckers. We want to present our plan, our concrete solutions and our responses to their concerns to as many people as possible. Seriously, you haven&#39;t seen anything yet! », Concluded Véronique Hivon.
