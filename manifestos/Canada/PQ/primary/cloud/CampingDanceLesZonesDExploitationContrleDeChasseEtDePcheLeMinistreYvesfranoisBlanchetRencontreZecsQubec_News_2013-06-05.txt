Quebec - On May 28, the Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet, met with the board of directors of Zecs Quebec, in particular about the practice of camping in controlled hunting and fishing zones (zecs). Zecs Québec, the federation that represents the 63 organizations that manage hunting and fishing zecs, took the opportunity to inform the Minister of the issues related to the new provisions of the Regulation respecting controlled hunting and fishing zones ( RLRQ, chapter C-61.1, r.78) and their application. The Minister said he was sensitive to these concerns as well as to those expressed by other stakeholders.
While maintaining the objective of improving the supervision of the practice of camping on the territory of the ZECs, the Minister was flexible as to the means of achieving this. To this end, the Minister announces the following measures:
&quot;I am convinced that the measures implemented will make it possible to harmonize the practice of camping with the concerns of the various stakeholders, while giving Quebecers fair access to public land,&quot; said Minister Blanchet.
The Minister also praised the commitment of hundreds of volunteers in supervising wildlife and recreational activities practiced by more than half a million Quebecers annually in controlled harvesting zones.
