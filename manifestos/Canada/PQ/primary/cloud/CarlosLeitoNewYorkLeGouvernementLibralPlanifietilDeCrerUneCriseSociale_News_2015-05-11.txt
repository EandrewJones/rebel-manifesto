Québec - The member for Rousseau and official opposition critic for finance and revenue, Nicolas Marceau, and the member for Sanguinet and spokesperson for the Conseil du trésor, Alain Therrien, ask the Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, to clarify the intentions of the Liberal government, while he invited New York investors, during his visit to the American metropolis, to prepare for a &quot;hot autumn&quot; in Quebec.
&quot;By announcing the holding of demonstrations, is the Minister of Finance telling us that his government has no intention of negotiating in good faith with state employees, as the law requires? Does the government, just as it did in 2012, during the student crisis, intend to use negotiations with its employees as a political tool to divide the population? The duty of a responsible government, on the contrary, is to try to create consensus, to encourage adherence to a common will, ”declared Nicolas Marceau.
“The Liberals have made division and confrontation their hallmarks. While Minister Leitão already presumes the negative outcome of negotiations with his employees, to whom he offers absolutely nothing over two years, let us recall that his government will increase, again this year, the salaries of doctors by $ 327 million; however, this sum is equivalent to 43% of the new money devoted to new program spending by all the ministries, ”concluded Alain Therrien.
