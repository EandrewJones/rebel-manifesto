Montreal - “The Castillo family represents what Quebec society expects from new Quebecers. She has integrated and is an asset for our community. To expel him would be a tragedy for the whole family and a huge loss for us. That is why I asked the Minister of Immigration and Cultural Communities of Quebec, Ms. Kathleen Weil, to support our approach. On this subject, I called on the minister, who said she was interested in meeting the family. I therefore ask him to intervene as soon as possible, ”said Parti Québécois MP for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Carole Poirier.
“Federal Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has discretion and can put an end to the anguish of the Castillo family. The eviction notice being for June 15, the Minister must act quickly and accept the family&#39;s request, ”added Ms. Poirier. The Castillo family arrived in Montreal four years ago. Family members applied as refugees since their lives were in danger in Mexico. The processing of their application has dragged on since then and it was only a few weeks ago that they learned that they had been refused and that they had to leave Canada by June 15.
&quot;The three Castillo children attend the Montreal School Board and are appreciated by all their comrades,&quot; said Daniel Duranleau, school commissioner of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. It is moreover the action of these comrades which made it possible to alert the deputies of the precarious situation of the Castillo family ”.
Representatives of all levels of government mobilized on Sunday June 5 to support the request made by members of the Castillo family to the federal Minister of Immigration to be recognized as refugees and to be able to stay in Quebec. The elected officials of Hochelaga ask the Minister of Immigration to have a little compassion in this matter and allow the family to continue to contribute to the well-being of the Montreal community.
