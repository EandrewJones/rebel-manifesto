Quebec - The member for Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, deplores the Liberal government&#39;s method of pushing its reform through the crossroads youth-employment (CJE).
“Carrefours jeunesse-emploi received a letter yesterday asking them to commit, before December 3, to signing a service agreement, but without knowing the details. By doing so, the government is putting the gun to the heads of the artisans of the CJEs. He told them: &quot;sign, or we will deal with other external resources&quot;, just as the Minister had mentioned during our last debate on this subject in the National Assembly. The CJEs and their boards of directors are worried and disappointed with this approach, ”said Dave Turcotte.
However, the member mentions that the government has backed down when it comes to young people not receiving social assistance or employment insurance; initially excluded from the reform of Minister François Blais, they can now hope for a certain openness.
“On the other hand, there is no guarantee of the maintenance of the resources and the mission of the CJEs. It would have been so much easier to ask them to pay particular attention to young people who are the furthest from the labor market, while ensuring them support for their entire mission. It is a debate of structures, initiated and pursued by the government, which does not take into account the particularities of the mission of the CJEs, nor the place where they are located. We will continue to fight so that no young people are left out and so that the CJEs are supported in their work, ”concluded Dave Turcotte.
