Quebec - The Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Seniors, Réjean Hébert, and the Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Sylvain Gaudreault, announced today that the period of validity of the health insurance card and driver&#39;s license will gradually be reduced from 4 to 8 years, as of October 1, 2014.
“There are many advantages to reducing the duration of the health insurance card to 8 years, starting with the fact that this measure will make life easier for citizens. At the same time, in addition to allowing us to generate savings, halving the number of renewals will help protect the environment by reducing the use of paper and plastic, ”indicated Minister Hébert. . Currently, the Régie issues some 2 million cards annually.
“This new measure is part of our government&#39;s desire to improve service delivery to citizens. By extending the validity period of the two pieces, we will be able to halve their trips to service points. This change aims to better adapt its services to the realities of the population, in particular by saving them time and money, ”added Minister Gaudreault.
The procedures for renewing the health insurance card and driver&#39;s license will remain the same and the issuance of documents will continue to be done in a synchronized manner.
