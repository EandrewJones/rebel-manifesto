Quebec - The member for Chambly and official opposition spokesperson for public security, Bertrand St-Arnaud, asks the Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, to appoint an independent investigator to shed light on the Ian Davidson case.
“This affair involving a former officer of the Police Department of the City of Montreal (SPVM) raises extremely disturbing questions and every day brings us its share of new revelations. Public confidence is shaken and it is important to shed light on everything that has happened in this file since that day in April 2011 when the SPVM learned that an individual was trying to monetize the highly confidential list of his informants. », Declared Bertrand St-Arnaud.
For the Parti Québécois, too many sensitive and important questions must be answered quickly. “What did the SPVM do in this case between April and October 2011, when Ian Davidson was intercepted while he was getting ready to fly to Costa Rica? Why was he not arrested when it was known that he had information that could put the lives of hundreds of people in danger? What discussions has the SPVM had with him? Why was Ian Davidson still at large in January 2012? Did other SPVM police officers help Ian Davidson? Asks the member for Chambly in particular.
“The elementary rule, in such circumstances and in this troubling affair, is to entrust this investigation to an independent investigator since members of the SPVM are directly involved. It is an essential gesture that the Minister of Public Security must take so that the public can have confidence, ”concluded Bertrand St-Arnaud.
