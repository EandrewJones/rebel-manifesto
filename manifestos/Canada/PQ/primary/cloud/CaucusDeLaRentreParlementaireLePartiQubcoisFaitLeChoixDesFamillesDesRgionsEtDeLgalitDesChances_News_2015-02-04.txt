Quebec - During a press briefing held on the sidelines of the caucus for the re-entry of the parliamentary wing of the Parti Québécois, the member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, indicated the priorities of the team of deputies for the coming session: support for families, defense of the regions and the desire to increase equal opportunities.
“The Liberal government is attacking families and regions. The accounting approach of liberal-Caquist austerity spares no one. These two parties are implementing destructive austerity. We choose to be close to the reality of the people, on the ground, in order to see the impact of their decisions, while in Quebec, the ministers remain in their offices. The distress that people in the regions are currently experiencing is very real; I invite members of the government to go see and listen to the population, ”declared Stéphane Bédard.
Each region of Quebec will have its deputy spokesperson for the Parti Québécois
To act as a relay for the regions, the Parti Québécois has decided to appoint a deputy spokesperson for each region where it has not elected a deputy. This has become necessary, because there are many examples of cuts affecting the regions hard:
“The government does not believe in local development or in the regions. The cuts affect all sectors of activity: economic development, families, youth, housing, and so on. For the Liberals, the regions no longer exist. They have no vision of the occupation of the territory, while the richness of Quebec lies in particular in the diversity of our regions. You have to trust the people who are on the ground, ”added Stéphane Bédard.
