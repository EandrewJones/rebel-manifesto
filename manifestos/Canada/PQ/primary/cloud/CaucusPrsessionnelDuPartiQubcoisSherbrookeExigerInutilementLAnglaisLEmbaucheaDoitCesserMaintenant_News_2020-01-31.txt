Sherbrooke, January 31, 2020 - At the end of the presessional caucus of the parliamentary wing in Sherbrooke, the MP for Matane-Matapédia, parliamentary leader and Parti Québécois spokesperson for the French language, Pascal Bérubé, announced that &#39;&#39; it will soon table a bill ensuring that only positions which genuinely require knowledge and use of English can be the subject of a requirement in this matter on the part of employers.
IN SHORT
- The Parti Québécois is ready to act without delay to strengthen and promote the French language.
- Our bill will amend Bill 101:
- The employer must demonstrate that both participation in the usual activities of the position and the accomplishment of the task require knowledge of another language.
“It is to say the least astonishing that in Quebec, an employer can require without valid reason the knowledge of a language other than French. We will correct this aberration with the bill that we will be tabling soon; this will amend article 46 of the Charter of the French language in order to specify the context in which an employer can require knowledge of a language other than French for a job, ”said Pascal Bérubé.
Gone, therefore, are the days when an employer could require knowledge of English to fill a diver position, as we are currently seeing. “From now on, we will have to prove that knowledge of another language is necessary for the accomplishment of the task, and that the work environment requires such mastery. In Quebec, the only common and official language is French, and workers have the right to carry out their activities in French and only in French, ”added the spokesperson.
The Parti Québécois proudly assumes its values and principles, and refuses to continue the decline in the use of French in the workplace. “While the CAQ is stagnating, we are in action. We are determined. With this bill, not only are we strengthening Bill 101, but we are also providing a solution to the labor shortage, because the requirement of English unnecessarily increases the difficulty, for some people, of find a job, ”concluded Pascal Bérubé.
