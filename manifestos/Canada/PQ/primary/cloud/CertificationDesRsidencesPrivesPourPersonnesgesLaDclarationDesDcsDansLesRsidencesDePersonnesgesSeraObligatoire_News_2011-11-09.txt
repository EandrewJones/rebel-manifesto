Quebec - “There will be mandatory declaration of deaths in CHSLDs, intermediate resources and private seniors&#39; residences. This is a good thing &quot;. This is what the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for seniors, Carole Poirier, said, happy that the Parti Québécois was able to get this amendment, and several others, to the draft. Bill 16, law aimed at tightening the certification process for private residences for the elderly in Quebec.
The law will therefore oblige the administrators of residences for the elderly, public or private, to inform the Coroner&#39;s Office of any death occurring in obscure circumstances. “When we say that the safety of our seniors is paramount and that any form of abuse and neglect towards them is unacceptable, we must take all means. This is how we forced the government to go further with Bill 16, ”continued Carole Poirier. The mechanics surrounding the form that the form can take and the administrative process will be known by regulation very soon.
Despite the adoption of certain amendments, the MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve regrets that several important issues, such as inspection and training, are still relegated to work tables. “I sincerely regret that the Liberal government is postponing until next year the setting up of the team of 23 inspectors, although provided for in the Bachand budget of last March. The same goes for the creation of a training work table and the mandatory ratio of trained staff per number of seniors in private residences. It is a little embarrassing that the government is postponing these essential questions, ”added the spokesperson.
“Much work remains to be done to ensure that our seniors live with dignity and the Parti Québécois has made this one of its top priorities,” concluded Carole Poirier.
