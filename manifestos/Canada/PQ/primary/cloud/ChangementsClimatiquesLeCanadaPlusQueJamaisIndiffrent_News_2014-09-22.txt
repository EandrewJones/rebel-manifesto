Quebec - The member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and the environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, denounces the absence of the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, at the Climate Summit which is taking place these days. these days in New York.
“Stephen Harper is once again demonstrating that he is completely indifferent to the fight against climate change and that Canada continues to navigate against the tide on this important issue for Quebecers. However, thousands of citizens told him yesterday, during the March for the Climate held in some twenty Quebec cities, the importance they attach to this fight, ”declared Sylvain Gaudreault.
According to the member, this shows that Quebec would have an interest in making its own environmental decisions and, above all, in having a government that assumes its responsibilities. “The Liberal Minister of the Environment is not enforcing Quebec&#39;s environmental laws. Yet we have the power to become a leader in the fight against climate change. Quebec must be able to decide for itself what happens in its territory. The environment falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Quebec, ”he reiterated.
“In the TransCanada pipeline, for example, we have repeatedly asked the minister to stop work at Gros-Cacouna and immediately hold a BAPE on the entire project. Will Minister Heurtel finally listen, or let the National Energy Board of Canada decide instead of Quebec? ”Sylvain Gaudreault concluded.
