Quebec - The member for Rimouski and official opposition spokesperson for the fight against poverty, solidarity and social economy, Harold LeBel, denounces the intention of the Minister of Labor, Employment and Social Solidarity, Sam Hamad, to move forward with the announced changes to the Individual and Family Assistance Regulation.
“Once again, the Liberal government is proving to us its lack of sensitivity towards the poor and the most vulnerable in our society. He did not listen to the demands of the groups, nor those of the Québec Ombudsman, nor those of the Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse who, however, strongly denounced the planned measures, even claiming that they represented an infringement of human rights. In short, the message the government is sending today is full of prejudice towards social assistance recipients and people in need, ”said Harold LeBel.
“With these changes, the minister is not seeking to achieve equity between claimants and low-income workers, nor to lift people out of poverty; rather, it ensures that poverty is equal for all. It&#39;s incredible, ”he added.
“The planned measures are unacceptable and will make the life of providers even more difficult. The minister, by ignoring the groups which made proposals to him, only aggravates the problems. After ten years of application, we must, all together, sit down to take stock of the Act to combat poverty and social exclusion, and ask ourselves the real questions: have we really succeeded in combating poverty? Do we have less prejudices? In light of the changes that the Minister wishes to apply, I very much doubt it, ”concluded the Member for Rimouski.
