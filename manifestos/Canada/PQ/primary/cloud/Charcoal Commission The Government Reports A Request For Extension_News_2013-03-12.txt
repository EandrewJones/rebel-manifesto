Quebec - The Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, has received an official request to extend the work of the Charbonneau commission.
Judge France Charbonneau estimates that an additional period of 18 months would be necessary for her to complete her investigation and make her recommendations. This means that his report would be tabled in two years, no later than April 19, 2015.
The request will be submitted to the Council of Ministers for analysis and decision.
The government will not comment further on this extension request.
