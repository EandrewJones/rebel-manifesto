Quebec - “Every day, people in need of specialized health care must travel to another region to obtain the health care they are medically required. However, if a person lives less than 250 kilometers from the place where they will be treated, they will have to pay the travel expenses themselves to seek treatment. It is time for the Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, to review this rule which represents a brake on access to health care ”.
This is what the member for Taschereau and official opposition critic for health, Agnès Maltais, said today in the National Assembly, after questioning Minister Bolduc. The deputies for Jonquière and Duplessis, Sylvain Gaudreault and Lorraine Richard, also intervened to demand that the minister move quickly.
According to an internal memo circulating at the Ministry of Health and Social Services, it is confirmed that if the eligibility standard for reimbursements were established at 200 kilometers, whereas it is currently at 250 kilometers, we would considerably increase access to Health care. It is estimated that 13,000 additional trips could be reimbursed at an estimated cost of $ 2.1 million.
The MP for Duplessis, Lorraine Richard, gave the example that in Havre-Saint-Pierre, pregnant women have to travel more than 230 kilometers, at their own expense, to get to Sept-Îles in order to have access to an ultrasound. . “This is a real example that many women experience on the North Shore. It must also happen elsewhere in Quebec, ”said Lorraine Richard.
“For over a year, I have been working tirelessly with Minister Bolduc to change the standard. It is a matter of basic fairness: residents of remote areas do not have to pay more for health care, they are already paying enough taxes. Minister Bolduc already has the studies necessary for the decision-making. We expect him to take action quickly, ”concluded Jonquière MNA Sylvain Gaudreault.
