Québec - Martine Ouellet, MP for Vachon and official opposition critic for transport, transportation electrification and maritime strategy, and MP for Verchères and spokesperson for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, denounce the silence of Transport Canada in the South Shore railway file.
Indeed, last week, the Parti Québécois, citizens&#39; associations and mayors of the region expressed their concerns about the deplorable state of the South Shore railway, considering that since July 19, more than 3 million liters of oil circulate on these rails every day. Following pressure from citizen associations, Transport Canada carried out inspections and ordered CN to limit the speed of all trains operating on the South Shore railway. However, we learned this week that the speed limit order has been lifted.
“I had the opportunity to talk to the people from Transport Canada. They informed me that they had carried out inspections on the rails, but they refused to make the inspection reports public. They also refused to organize information sessions for citizens. Transport Canada must reconsider its position. It is a public body; it must act in full transparency and respect citizens, ”said Martine Ouellet.
“Citizens have expressed legitimate concerns. Transport Canada has a duty to inform and reassure them. Remember that the work of the federal body was severely criticized by the Transportation Safety Board&#39;s report on the Lac-Mégantic tragedy. Quebecers have a right to expect more than exemplary work from him, ”concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
