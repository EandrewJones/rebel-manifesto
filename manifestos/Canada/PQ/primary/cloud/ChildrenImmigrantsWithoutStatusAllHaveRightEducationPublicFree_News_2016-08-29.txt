Quebec - The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of education, research and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, asks the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Sébastien Proulx, to act so that the children of immigrants without status can go to school like the others, and without delay.
“Due to the turnover of ministers of education, the file of undocumented students is stretching and no solution is put forward by the ministry. Hundreds, maybe even thousands of students will not be attending school this year because their immigration status is not confirmed, for a variety of reasons. The minister must solve the problem and, in the meantime, use his discretionary power so that the children concerned can go to school as quickly as possible ”, explained the deputy.
“The government of Quebec has declared itself bound by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, according to which primary education is compulsory and free for all. States which adhere to it must also promote access to secondary education. In addition, as the Ombudsperson concludes, all children domiciled in Quebec must have access to free public education and attend elementary or secondary school, regardless of their immigration status or status. that of his parents, ”recalled Alexandre Cloutier.
Note that Ontario and British Columbia admit, free of charge, people without legal status to public schools. Why is Quebec lagging behind on the file? “Through Bill 86 on the governance of the education network, without completely solving the problem, the ministry at least extended the right to free education to non-residents. However, after throwing this bill in the trash, the government presented us with a new version, Bill 105, which made no mention of this important issue. In short, the government is backing down even before it has moved forward, ”the spokesperson concluded.
