Quebec - The Parti Québécois criticized the Liberal government for neglecting the quality and quantity of care for our seniors by insisting on imposing the PPP formula for the construction of CHSLDs.
“Our seniors are currently paying the price for liberal ideology. The savings of $ 100 million that we were promised for a new CHSLD in Saint-Lambert have melted like snow in the sun: it is rather an additional cost of $ 60 million that taxpayers will have to pay. When will the Liberal government realize that it is on the wrong track? Asks the member for Crémazie and official opposition spokesperson for seniors, Lisette Lapointe.
For her part, the MP for Vachon, Martine Ouellet, underlines that the PPP method in Saint-Lambert comes down to: problem over problem. “In addition to an astronomical increase in costs, there is a shortage of doctors, there is a lack of knowledge and expertise and the turnover of staff is worrying. The relentlessness of the Liberal government to use this formula is doubtful, ”said Martine Ouellet.
“In 2007, Minister Jean-Marc Fournier made a promise to the seniors of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu by telling them that they were going to spend a beautiful Christmas in 2009 in a new pavilion. We are in April 2011 and construction has not started. Our seniors have a right to quality services, but the Liberal government is washing its hands of that. This is unacceptable, ”concluded Saint-Jean MP Dave Turcotte.
