Québec, October 27, 2017 - The official opposition spokesperson for the Metropolis and in matters of immigration and cultural communities, Carole Poirier, is sorry about the latest results presented by the Minister of Immigration, Diversity and Inclusion (MIDI) concerning the reception of French-speaking immigrants. In 5 years, their proportion has dropped drastically, from 62% to 42%. Ms. Poirier is calling for concrete measures to immediately reverse this trend.
IN SHORT
“The figures presented yesterday by MIDI are a statement of failure for the Liberal government. Obviously, such a heavy trend will not be reversed by the minor changes the department has made to the selection grid for newcomers. Moreover, by his own admission, he does not think he will be able to reverse this trend in the short term. What does that mean? That we will drop below 40% next year? And then under 35%? If we trust the trend for 5 years, without anything being done to reverse it, it is a possibility. However, the first cause of the decline of French, especially in Montreal, is the failure of the francization of our immigrants, ”said Carole Poirier.
“To turn the tide, the Parti Québécois wants to achieve the goal of 100% francization. For this, we propose to ensure that each qualified worker selected as well as his or her spouse have an intermediate or advanced knowledge of French. We also want refugees to be able to benefit from a period of paid French language training and adaptation. This is how we will ensure the sustainability of our language, ”she added.
