Quebec - Parti Québécois agriculture and food spokesperson André Villeneuve denounces the Liberal Party&#39;s stagnation in the face of the radical drop in Quebec greenhouse vegetable production.
“While Ontario is making agriculture a priority, here the Liberal government remains inactive, even if Quebec is losing market share. The Liberal Party, in power for two years, has still not presented an economic policy or an agricultural policy. Greenhouse growers must immediately benefit from firm support. It is not true that we are going to sit idly by while Ontario vegetables take the place of Quebec products on the shelves. In addition to preferential electricity tariffs, several solutions are possible, whether it is cogeneration from wood chips or the conversion of waste into biogas. What is Minister Pierre Paradis waiting for to act? “Asks André Villeneuve.
Remember that as part of the Food Sovereignty Policy, the Parti Québécois had decreed that Hydro-Quebec had to provide a preferential tariff to producers. Unfortunately, the Liberals abandoned it. “With the Food Sovereignty Policy, the Parti Québécois gave impetus to Quebec agriculture by focusing first of all on local purchasing. The arrival of the Liberals dampened this momentum. Instead of tabling an agricultural policy, Pierre Paradis proposed a discussion. He should realize that our farmers and our processors are in tune with the market and that they need actions, not words, ”continued the MP for Berthier.
Growth in farm income is already lower in Quebec than in Ontario, and Liberal inaction is widening this gap even further. “Where is the plan of the Government of Quebec? Farmers and industry are still waiting for the Liberals to act. Why has the government thrown out the Food Sovereignty Policy when it has no plan to replace it? Currently, Pierre Paradis&#39; line of conduct is partisanship. Rather, it should focus on helping the agricultural world, ”concluded André Villeneuve.
