Quebec - The MNA for Joliette and official opposition critic for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, deplores the fact that this morning, Minister Hélène David has exacerbated, rather than appeased, the concerns of the cultural community and all lovers of cinema by not ruling out the disappearance of the Cinémathèque québécoise through its merger with the Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec. Worse, she seems to have wanted, through her answers to the questions from the member for Joliette, to confirm this scenario.
&quot;I join my voice to those of the employees of the Cinémathèque and the artisans of the community, who today launch a true cry from the heart so that the Cinémathèque is saved and that the unacceptable scenario of merger, which would have dramatic impacts on the activities of the Cinémathèque, be abandoned. Thus, we also echo the cry of alarm launched, at the beginning of the month, by producers and directors of great renown. I asked Minister Hélène David to end the uncertainty, which she refused to do. In the name of austerity and for the sake of savings, it brings into play the essential mission of the Cinémathèque: to preserve, disseminate and promote our audiovisual and cinematographic heritage ”, declared Véronique Hivon.
“The cultural community has already been severely damaged by the Liberal government. Just think of the sad episode of the conservatories, the abandonment of the book policy, the cuts in tax credits for cultural production ... Today, by definitively excluding the merger of two institutions with very different missions , by taking a clear position in favor of the Cinémathèque, the Minister could and should have taken the opportunity to demonstrate in the community that she is defending it. Our cultural heritage is our history, our identity, our wealth. The government must wake up and show that it understands it and, consequently, rule out any possibility of a merger, ”concluded the member for Joliette.
