Montreal - The MP for Vachon, Martine Ouellet, and the MP for La Prairie, François Rebello, this morning set out a plan to maximize the use of the rail network serving the municipalities of southwest Montreal.
“Rush hour in Montreal is actually a 24 hour rush hour. Under these conditions, it is unthinkable to let trains run empty and to leave them in the garage while the citizens are roped up around the bridges, ”François Rebello stressed at the outset.
The plan contains the following measures:
“Anyone who travels between Montreal and the South Shore in any direction knows very well that access to the city, regardless of the direction, is regularly hampered. Even on Sundays at noon there is congestion. This situation must absolutely be remedied, ”lamented the member for La Prairie.
“It is a fundamental issue in the daily life of citizens. It is imperative that things change quickly. The measures we are proposing this morning will make it possible to lay the foundations for genuine sustainable development in Quebec, ”said the Member for Vachon, Martine Ouellet.
For his part, the member for Gouin and official opposition critic for transport, Nicolas Girard, said that once again the Liberal government had shown a lack of long-term vision while waiting for the situation is uncontrollable before acting. “The measures my colleagues are proposing can certainly serve as guidelines in the strategy that the government must now adopt,” Nicolas Girard concluded.
