Québec– The member for Bertrand and official opposition spokesperson for tourism, Claude Cousineau, wishes to congratulate the winners of the 2014 Grand Prix du tourisme québécois. Gathered in Laval on May 12 and 13, as part of the 10th edition of the Assises du Tourisme, the artisans and partners of the Quebec tourism community have once again demonstrated the vitality and diversity of their industry.
&quot;The quality of the work of the winners and finalists demonstrates the importance of the tourism industry, not only for the economy and employment in each of our regions, but also for the Quebec identity,&quot; said Claude Cousineau. When a business in our area values the land, natural attractions or our sense of hospitality to make it a tourist product, it is our entire culture that it shines! &quot;
The spokesperson congratulates the 54 winners in the 18 categories and takes the opportunity to share his availability with stakeholders in the tourist industry. He wants to quickly soak up the various issues in order to be able to work effectively on the orientations to be given to Quebec policies to improve our performance in terms of tourism.
“I would like to especially congratulate Chef Normand Laprise, named tourist personality of the year. This choice is proof that fine cuisine is a rapidly growing tourist product in Quebec, ”the member for Bertrand also rejoiced.
&quot;I also learned about the community&#39;s concerns about the decrease in the number of American tourists,&quot; continued Mr. Cousineau. I share the concerns expressed by some participants in the Assises and I invite the Minister of Tourism, Dominique Vien, to make the necessary representations so that the Canadian Tourism Commission reinvests in promotion to put our destination back at the top of the list of American travelers. . &quot;
The Parti Québécois will be very attentive to the priorities that the Minister will determine in relation to the Tourism Industry Development Plan 2012-2020. Recall that the former Minister for Tourism had tabled two strategies giving priority to winter and the St. Lawrence River as tourism products with strong development potential.
&quot;Let us hope that Ms. Vien will be able to draw inspiration from the fruits of the work of the tourism industry and seriously consider these two strategies,&quot; concluded Claude Cousineau.
