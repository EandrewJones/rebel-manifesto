Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts - Following the article signed by Denis Lessard and entitled &quot;The deputy for Bertrand is thinking of rallying to Legault&quot;, published in the daily La Presse this morning, Claude Cousineau wishes to make the point.
“I am a proud member of the Parti Québécois caucus and I intend to remain so. I said that to the extraordinary caucus yesterday and I haven&#39;t changed my mind about it. There is therefore no question of me joining François Legault&#39;s coalition, ”declared the member for Bertrand.
“I also recalled that I was thinking about my personal political future to know if I will stand for the next election. I will reflect and consult my relatives during the summer period, ”added Claude Cousineau.
The deputy also wishes to reassure the activists of his constituency. “All kinds of speculation is going around right now. I want to reassure you today. I am at your side to defend and promote the Parti Québécois program that we adopted together at the last convention. I am a sovereignist and I am still a member of the Parti Québécois. Our political party is a great party which is the only vehicle that can lead us to the achievement of the sovereignty of Quebec, ”concluded Claude Cousineau.
