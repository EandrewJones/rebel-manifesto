Quebec, April 3, 2020 - Lorraine Richard, Member of Parliament for Duplessis and Parti Québécois spokesperson for public safety, relays a growing number of voices demanding clarification on the roadblocks supposed to protect the regions against the spread of COVID -19.
IN SHORT
Day by day, the situation becomes more and more chaotic. “The goal is to reduce travel. But if a checkpoint is in place only four hours a day, it does not give the expected results, ”argued Lorraine Richard.
We must adapt to the reality of each territory, of course, but public health and public safety must relay a coherent message, so that the instructions are followed by the population.
For now, however, the guidelines are unclear. In many places elected officials are overwhelmed. “Because they want to protect their community, some take the initiative to close access to their municipality. In addition, people continue to move from one MRC to another; the police may raise awareness, they do not have the power to block the passage to anyone, ”illustrated the deputy.
“Closing regions was the right thing to do. My colleagues from the Parti Québécois and I welcomed this decision by the government, and we reiterate that we remain here to relay its messages. But we have to do it right, taking into account the concerns of the people and the particularities of each region. The instructions must be clear, and the resources to apply them, available, ”concluded Lorraine Richard.
