Quebec - The member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, youth protection, home care and prevention, Jean-François Lisée, denounces the closure of 11 residences with continuous assistance in Quebec. Montreal intellectual disability and pervasive developmental disorders rehabilitation center.
“While ministers Gaétan Barrette and Lucie Charlebois claim that Bill 10, adopted under gag order, has no effect on services, we are once again seeing the opposite. These residences are essential for people who are already vulnerable. They and their families learn that they will be deprived of services or transferred to private intermediary resources. The Liberal government has no mandate to privatize services to the population, ”said Jean-François Lisée.
The Member points out that these cuts are in addition to those already observed, in particular by the Québec Ombudsman, on waiting times for young people with autism spectrum disorder. “The wait times are unacceptable for these young people. The cuts of $ 600 million in the health network in 2015-2016 hurt. The budget for services for intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders has only been increased by 0.74%, which translates in concrete terms into service cuts in establishments, ”he added.
