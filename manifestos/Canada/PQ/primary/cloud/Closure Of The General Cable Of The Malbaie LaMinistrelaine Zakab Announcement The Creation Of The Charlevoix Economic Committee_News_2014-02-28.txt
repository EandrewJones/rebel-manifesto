La Malbaie - At the end of the first working meeting of the Economic Committee of Charlevoix-Est, the Minister for Industrial Policy and the Bank of Economic Development of Quebec, Ms. Élaine Zakaïb, wished to confirm, on behalf of the Premier of Quebec, Ms. Pauline Marois, that the Government of Quebec intends to continue its efforts to ensure the continuity of the activities of the General Cable plant in La Malbaie, which is scheduled to close in April 2014.
&quot;The announcement of the closure of this factory is of great concern to us,&quot; said Élaine Zakaïb. “For our government, it is very important to support the region and the workers affected. I wish to participate actively in this economic committee which, I am convinced, will be able to explore all possible avenues to keep activities in place and preserve existing jobs. &quot;
Led by the Local Development Center (CLD) of the Charlevoix-Est MRC, this committee is made up of local economic partners and Minister Zakaïb. The participation of the Government of Quebec is ensured by the Ministère des Finances et de l&#39;Économie, Investissement Québec and Emploi-Québec.
&quot;For my government, all the regions of Quebec constitute a great wealth and are part of the priorities,&quot; said Pauline Marois. “This is why I asked Minister Élaine Zakaïb to represent me on this committee to ensure that we bring all our expertise to support the economy of the Charlevoix-Est sector, as we do elsewhere when the situation commands it. We are acting promptly to find solutions and we will do everything we can to help and support the workers and families affected by this closure. &quot;
