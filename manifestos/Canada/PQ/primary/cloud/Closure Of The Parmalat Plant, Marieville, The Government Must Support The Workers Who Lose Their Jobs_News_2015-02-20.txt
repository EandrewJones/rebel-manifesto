Québec, February 20, 2015 - The member for Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, the member for Saint-Jérôme et porte -speaking on the economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, as well as the deputy for Berthier and spokesperson for agriculture, André Villeneuve, asked the government to support the 92 workers who lose their jobs following the closure of the Parmalat plant in Marieville.
“More than 90 workers are now unemployed. We want the government to do everything in its power to support Parmalat and its employees. Our region, Montérégie, is losing a factory; more than 90 families find themselves struggling with a significant loss of income. Emploi-Québec must be available to help them, particularly workers who will not be relocated, ”said Dave Turcotte.
“What has the government done to try to support the company and prevent the closure of the Marieville plant? How long had he known about it? What will he do to help the workers? Without an economic policy, the government is sailing on sight, which has harmful effects on our businesses, ”added Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“Once again, the Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, has remained inactive, abandoning the world of agriculture and the agri-food sector. The dairy industry represents more than $ 5 billion for the Quebec economy. It is therefore essential to maintain jobs in processing to ensure the future of the sector, ”concluded André Villeneuve.
