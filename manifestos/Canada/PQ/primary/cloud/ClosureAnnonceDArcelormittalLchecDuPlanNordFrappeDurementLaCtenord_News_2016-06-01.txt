Quebec - The member for Duplessis and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of northern development, Lorraine Richard, denounces the abandonment of the North Shore by the Liberal government. “The Plan Nord is one of the most resounding failures of the current Liberal government,” she said.
“On the North Shore, the results are disastrous. There was the bankruptcy of Cliffs Ressources naturelles, the abandonment of the FerroAtlántica silicon plant project, the putting on hold of Mine Arnaud and the reduction in the activities of the Rio Tinto mining company in Havre-Saint-Pierre. To add to this, this morning we learned that ArcelorMittal will reduce its activities as early as 2020 and could close completely in 2030, following the announcement of the indefinite postponement of an investment essential to the continuation of the mine&#39;s operations. Nearly 2,500 direct jobs, particularly in Port-Cartier and Fermont, will be lost at that time. However, the survival of these communities depends on maintaining ArcelorMittal&#39;s activities, ”also explained the Member for Duplessis.
“It&#39;s a massacre on the North Shore, and the government has no economic recovery and diversification plan. This region is emptying its population four times faster than any other region in Quebec. The unemployment rate hit 11% last April. The level of concern is already very high and this announcement does nothing to reassure families. Yet the government is aware of the situation. It must take concrete action to ensure the survival of ArcelorMittal&#39;s facilities in Port-Cartier and Fermont, in order to guarantee a dynamic future for the region. I also invite him to think urgently about a real northern development plan that takes into account the importance of economic diversification, so that the region can face the lows of the mining cycle. The main flaw in the Liberal Plan Nord is precisely that it only anticipated the peaks of this cycle, ”concluded Lorraine Richard.
