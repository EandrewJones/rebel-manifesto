Montreal - As soon as the announcement, on May 6, of the closure of the Old Dutch plant in Lachine, which will lead to the loss of more than 200 jobs, the Minister for Industrial Policy and the Banque de développement économique du Québec , Ms. Élaine Zakaïb, set up an intervention committee to try to convince the American company to keep its Quebec subsidiary open. Made up of representatives of Investissement Québec, the Ministry of Finance and the Economy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as well as the City of Montreal and Montreal International, this committee aims to coordinate the efforts to maximize the chances of success.
&quot;I can assure you that we will explore all possible avenues to get the company to abandon the closure, while respecting our responsible investment criteria,&quot; said Minister Delegate Élaine Zakaïb.
The government of Quebec has already started discussions with Old Dutch in order to find a solution to avoid the closure of the plant, which would take place next September.
The Minister Delegate Zakaïb also wished to underline the collaboration of the Member of Parliament for Marquette, Mr. François Ouimet. &quot;When it comes to saving jobs, partisanship has no place,&quot; said Minister Delegate. &quot;I am happy to see that all the players concerned are ready to work together to try to find a solution in the short term and thus save the jobs at stake.&quot;
