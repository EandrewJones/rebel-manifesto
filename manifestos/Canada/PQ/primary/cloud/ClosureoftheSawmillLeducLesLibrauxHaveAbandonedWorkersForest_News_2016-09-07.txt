Quebec - The MP for Bonaventure and Parti Québécois spokesperson for forests, Sylvain Roy, expresses his solidarity with the 75 workers at the Leduc sawmill in Quebec who will lose their jobs on October 28, and urges the government to find solutions to the continuing crisis in the forestry sector.
“Once again, the government is abandoning the workers! In this factory, 70% of the employees have between 35 and 40 years of seniority, which will not make their job any easier when the time comes to find a new job. In addition, for these workers, no relocation is possible. It&#39;s a real drama! The government must deploy its resources to help them, ”said Sylvain Roy.
&quot;The new Minister of Forests, Luc Blanchette, who has remained silent since his appointment more than two weeks ago, must tell us what he will do to help not only these workers, but also our entire forestry industry. . As we know, the upcoming negotiations with the Americans on the new softwood lumber agreement will be particularly difficult. In this context, each new plant closure weakens Quebec&#39;s position. The minister must ensure that the negotiations will not harm Quebec businesses. Over 30,000 jobs have been lost over the past 10 years in the forestry industry; This situation can not continue! Solutions must be put in place quickly, ”concluded Sylvain Roy.
