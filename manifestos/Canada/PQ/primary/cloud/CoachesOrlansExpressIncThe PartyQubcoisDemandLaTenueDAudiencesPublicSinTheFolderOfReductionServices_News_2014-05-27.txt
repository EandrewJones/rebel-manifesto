Quebec - Following the publication, by the Commission des transports du Québec, of a notice setting out the modifications requested by Autocars Orléans Express inc. (Keolis Canada) with regard to some of its schedules and frequencies, as well as in connection with the elimination of several services, the members of the Parti Québécois sent the Commission a request for the holding of public hearings.
&quot;Considering the importance of the modifications requested by Autocars Orléans Express inc., The holding of public hearings in the affected regions seems essential to us in order to allow citizens and elected officials to express themselves on the consequences of a reduction in services and to reflect on the various alternatives that may be considered, ”Martine Ouellet, MP for Vachon and official opposition spokesperson for transportation, transportation electrification and maritime strategy, emphasized.
The reduction in services offered by Autocars Orléans Express inc. would lead to several direct consequences, such as reduced mobility for seniors and accessibility to the Rimouski hospital, a limitation of the parcel delivery service, the loss of around 40 jobs, and could even threaten tourism development in Gaspésie. Moreover, this reduction would mainly affect students and seniors, especially those with low incomes.
“With almost non-existent rail service and overpriced air service, the bus is becoming the one and only means of public transportation for a large part of the inhabitants of Gaspésie and Bas-Saint-Laurent. A reduction in service could have significant consequences for our economy and the mobility of our families and our workers, ”reminded the MP for Gaspé, Gaétan Lelièvre, on behalf of his colleagues from Rimouski, Harold LeBel, from Matane- Matapedia, Pascal Bérubé, and from Bonaventure, Sylvain Roy.
