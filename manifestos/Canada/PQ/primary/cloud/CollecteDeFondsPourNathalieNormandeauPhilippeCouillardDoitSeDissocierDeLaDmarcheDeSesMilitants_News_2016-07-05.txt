Shocked by the initiative of two liberal activists who solicit donations for the defense of Nathalie Normandeau, the deputy for Bonaventure, Sylvain Roy, asks the Prime Minister to immediately dissociate himself from this process.
“When we see that children have nothing to eat for lunch, that the food banks are empty, I have a hard time with a campaign to finance the defense of Ms. Normandeau. The former minister is criminally charged for illegal fundraising activities. Now it is his turn to receive help from the Liberal family. It is an indecent step, and the Prime Minister must immediately tell Quebeckers if he endorses it or if he dissociates himself from the liberal militants who launched it, ”declared Sylvain Roy.
The initiators Fabrice Bourque and André Poirier are two long-standing liberal activists. Mr. Bourque, in addition to having contributed many times to the Liberal Party, has already chaired the Liberal Association of Gaspésie – Îles-de-la-Madeleine. Mr. Poirier, for his part, has already tried to be a Liberal candidate in Bonaventure and has given, according to the records of the Chief Electoral Officer, several thousand dollars to the Liberal Party election fund, including a donation of $ 500 to Philippe Couillard during the leadership race.
“It is a flagrant lack of ethics to solicit donations for the defense of a former minister accused, among other things, of conspiracy, corruption, fraud and breach of trust. Premier Couillard must unhesitatingly condemn this fundraiser. Instead of paying Nathalie Normandeau&#39;s legal costs, I am convinced that Quebecers prefer to make a donation to an organization in their region that improves the well-being of people in need, ”concluded the Member for Bonaventure.
