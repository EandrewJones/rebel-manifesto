Québec, Sunday, August 25, 2019 - As part of the Parti Québécois&#39; revival process, the regional associations of the Parti Québécois de la Capitale-Nationale and Chaudière-Appalaches jointly organized a colloquium on sovereignty at Laval University in presence of Pascal Bérubé, parliamentary leader of the Parti Québécois and Member of Parliament for Matane-Matapédia and Sylvain Gaudreault, Member of Parliament for Jonquière.
During the day, more than 120 people took part in a series of conferences and discussions aimed at trying to develop in synergy an inspiring project for Quebec by rallying ideas from cultural workers, entrepreneurs and representatives of all the generations. Several speakers were able to discuss with the public possible solutions to better promote the independence project in the greater Quebec City region, while reconciling the interests of different generations.
“Independence is a simple gesture that brings great responsibilities. As a party that embodies this idea, we also have a responsibility to be as exemplary as the project we wish to carry out. The deputies, the members of the executive, the employees, the activists, we must all live up to this idea, this project. We must be unifying, attentive, empathetic, open. »Said Serge Bonin, advisor to the national executive and organizer of the event.
“In the Parti Québécois, we have not given up our pride. But we know we have to do things differently. However, the modernization of the Parti Québécois must involve all generations. It is fundamental. We listen, and we take into account the ideas expressed. This is where our strength will lie for the future. That&#39;s what the Parti Québécois is: having ideas, discussing them, debating, deciding, rallying. ” concluded Pascal Bérubé, parliamentary leader of the Parti Québécois.
