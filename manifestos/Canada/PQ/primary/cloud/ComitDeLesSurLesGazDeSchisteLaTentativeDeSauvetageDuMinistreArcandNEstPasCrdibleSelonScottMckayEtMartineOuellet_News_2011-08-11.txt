Quebec - “The Parti Québécois considers that the announcement of the appointment, by Minister Arcand, of a new member from the environmental community to the Strategic Environmental Assessment committee on shale gas completely insufficient. With the gas companies still present, the committee is still not credible. Gas companies cannot be judges and parties. The Office of Public Hearings on the Environment must be associated with the SEA, as requested by more than 10,000 citizens who demonstrated in the streets of Montreal last June ”, declared Scott McKay, Member of Parliament for L &#39; Assumption and official opposition spokesperson for mines, and Martine Ouellet, MNA for Vachon and spokesperson for the environment, sustainable development, parks and water.
It will be remembered that the citizens present at the demonstration on June 18 had three demands, namely:
“The minister&#39;s announcement yesterday confirms that the government has deliberately rejected almost all of the requests. This is totally unacceptable and unfortunately it proves once again that the Liberal government does not listen to the complaints of the people, ”added Mr. McKay.
“In addition, as there is no moratorium, drilling activities are continuing and some wells that have already been drilled still pose significant gas leakage problems. For their part, the gas companies are continuing their drilling plans as if nothing had happened. There are risks of water contamination and air pollution, ”added Martine Ouellet.
“Minister Arcand is missing a great opportunity to restore the bond of trust with the population. When will the Liberal government finally stop defending the private interests of gas companies? », Concluded Scott McKay.
