Quebec - On this Memorial Day for those who died or were injured at work, celebrated around the world, the member for Verchères and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of work, Stéphane Bergeron, made a point of raising the awareness of the government and the whole of the Quebec population to the importance of prevention in the workplace.
“In 2015, in Quebec, 196 of our workers lost their lives as a result of an accident or occupational disease. And 87,000 others were victims of an accident at work. We must work together to improve this sad record. Hence the importance of awareness and prevention in the workplace, ”said Stéphane Bergeron.
On this commemorative day, across Quebec, thousands of workers will observe a minute of silence to honor the memory of their deceased colleagues. “Every accident that occurs in the workplace is one too many. These are all human and family tragedies that we must strive to avoid. It is simply inadmissible for a person to injure himself or even lose his life while working to gain it, ”added the member for Verchères.
“I invite everyone, and the government in particular, to make the health and safety of our workers top priorities. Quebec does not have the means to do without any of them. Let us ensure that supervision and prevention are improved; we will all be winners, ”concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
