Quebec - In the context of the sharp rise in electronic commerce, which increases the competition with which our businesses are confronted, the leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, called on Prime Minister Philippe Couillard to take action on the part of his government. interest of the Quebec economy.
“Our businesses are in competition with outside businesses that are making increasingly significant sales in Quebec without ensuring that taxes are collected. Unfair competition threatens thousands of jobs in our businesses and the government, which has imposed austerity for two years, also accepts to lose hundreds of millions in tax revenues without doing anything. The Liberal government has not created a single job for a year. It cannot afford to let unfair competition cause stores to close, as has already happened in several places across Quebec, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
The leader of the Parti Québécois recalls that Peter Simons, a credible and recognized businessman, said that in addition to disadvantaging job creators in Quebec, “[o] n has come to cut [in] the education of our children, in financing the health care of our parents ”.
In 4 years, nearly 3,000 businesses have closed their doors in Quebec. Customs controls are virtually non-existent, and the federal government is doing nothing to remedy the situation. In addition, the banking industry does not enforce our laws, and Ottawa turns a blind eye.
“Since the Prime Minister does not seem to know any solution, we are going to offer him one, issued in particular by the OECD. Virtually all purchases made on the Internet involve payment intermediaries to complete the transactions. Why not require Visa, MasterCard and PayPal to collect taxes on transactions made from Quebec? Has the Prime Minister considered this solution? », Added Pierre Karl Péladeau.
