Montreal - The Parti Québécois wants to shed light on corruption, collusion and influence peddling. His lawyer, Me Estelle Tremblay, yesterday during the hearings of the Charbonneau commission, wanted to check with the witness, Lino Zambito, whether illegal donations, in particular in cash, had been made to the Parti Québécois or to representatives of the Parti Québécois . The ex-entrepreneur confirmed that he never gave cash to anyone at the Parti Québécois between 1998 and 2011.
During the period from 1998 to 2003, Lino Zambito made a single donation of $ 600 to the Parti Québécois, in 2001. He never used a nominee to fund the Parti Québécois.
Between 1998 and 2003, Lino Zambito obtained contracts from the Quebec Ministry of Transport totaling some $ 30 million. He confirmed to the Charbonneau commission that there was no link between the donation he made to the Parti Québécois in 2001 and the contracts obtained.
Mr. Zambito also told the commission that there were no false extras or inflated extras during the period from 1998 to 2003, when the Parti Québécois was in power.
Lino Zambito&#39;s testimony shows that it is wrong to say that all parties act the same, that all politicians are corrupt and that all governments are just as corrupt.
At the Parti Québécois, we will not hide behind the procedure to prevent the population from obtaining the truth about the plots that took place in Quebec in the construction industry, as well as the links between this industry and party funding. policies. This is about the management of taxes for all Quebecers, and they have the right to get answers. This is the mandate that the Parti Québécois gave to Me Estelle Tremblay.
