“We have long called for this commission of inquiry. She is now in place, she has our full confidence and we believe it is essential that she get to the bottom of things. An 18-month extension is a very long time, but it is the length of time that President France Charbonneau considers necessary to fully fulfill her mandate, ”said Bertrand St-Arnaud.

That is why, in responsible government, we ask the Commission to produce, by January 31, 2014, a progress report outlining the progress of its work and the resulting findings, possible solutions, any recommendations it deems appropriate and the work it still plans to accomplish with a view to producing its final report by April 19, 2015 at the latest ”, concluded the Minister of Justice and Prosecutor general.
