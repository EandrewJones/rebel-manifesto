Quebec - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, and the spokesperson for indigenous affairs, Guy Leclair, ask that the mandate of the new commission of inquiry into missing indigenous women or murders is broad and covers all crimes committed. They also want Aboriginal people to be an integral part of the process and decision-making that affects them.
“It is essential that aboriginal women be consulted, that they participate in the commission of inquiry, and that their role be truly decision-making. Sexism, still present and tolerated in our society, is accentuated by the multiple sources of violence that Indigenous women have faced for decades. The death and disappearance of nearly 1,200 of them, or the sexual assaults that many have denounced in Val-d&#39;Or, testify to the sexist and discriminatory abuses suffered by Native women, ”declared Carole Poirier.
By enacting the Indian Act, Canada not only instituted a colonial system meaning paternalism, loss of autonomy and dependence for Indigenous people, but it also reinforced a sexist model, the basis of which is the absence of consent for women. . It should also be remembered that between 1980 and 2012, the RCMP recorded 1,181 cases concerning aboriginal women - 1,017 were killed and 164 are missing - which exceeds previous estimates, which were closer to 600.
Guy Leclair reiterated the importance of holding a truly independent investigation into the events in Val-d&#39;Or. “Although the announcement of a federal commission of inquiry is good news for aboriginal women in Quebec, it is deplorable that Philippe Couillard&#39;s government is trying to shirk its responsibilities. By refusing to conduct an independent public inquiry into the events in Val-d&#39;Or, he is in fact turning a blind eye to a very real problem happening in our streets and in our villages, ”he insisted.
