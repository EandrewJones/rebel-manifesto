Quebec - The MP for Marie-Victorin, Bernard Drainville, and the MP for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for housing, Carole Poirier, denounce the arrogance of the Liberal government, which refused their attendance at a working session of the Regional Planning Commission; it met this morning to discuss the relevance of taking up a petition concerning the AccèsLogis Québec program, submitted by Bernard Drainville.
The custom is that by consent, the spokesperson for the file dealt with in the petition and the deputy who presented the petition replace members of the committee for the duration of the sitting.
“This morning, the Liberal members of the committee refused to allow Carole Poirier and myself to participate in the meeting. This is unheard of; it is a denial of democracy. The Liberals are ignoring existing customs and acting like kings and masters of Parliament, ”denounced Bernard Drainville.
Carole Poirier recalls for her part that the government has halved the programming of AccèsLogis for this year. In fact, instead of the 3,000 expected, only 1,500 new AccèsLogis homes are in the budget.
“This is the weakest lineup for 15 years. The government has chosen to opt for the partial privatization of social housing, rather than the construction of new community, social and affordable housing. However, he should know that this type of construction allows the economic development of all regions of Quebec, while creating jobs and promoting social diversity and urban revitalization, ”concluded Carole Poirier.
