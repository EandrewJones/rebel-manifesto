Quebec - The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of education and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, calls on the government to reverse and stop the destruction of mezzanines in schools in the region from Sherbrooke.
For 10 years now, mezzanines have been installed in classes specially designed by teachers who wish to promote student success and make the classes more interactive. These facilities are now threatened with destruction because they do not meet the standards of the Régie du bâtiment. &quot;The government opts here for the easy solution&quot;, denounced Alexandre Cloutier.
“Here we have a very good example of an initiative of teachers who innovate to support the success of our young people. They thought about these places and designed them especially to make their class more user-friendly and that reading becomes fun for the students, which is not easy in 2016. Instead of automatically applying its rules, the government must ensure that they are adapted, in collaboration with the schools, in order to allow the initiative to continue while ensuring the safety of the students, ”added the Member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
Once again, parents and teachers are under an obligation to mobilize to defend the achievements that promote the success of their children. “The minister responsible for the region, Luc Fortin, however declared that he wanted to save the mezzanines. Three months later, he sided with the government&#39;s arguments and let down those teachers and parents. It is one to midnight. We ask the Minister of Education, Sébastien Proulx, to intervene quickly before the destruction of the mezzanines is completed, ”concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
