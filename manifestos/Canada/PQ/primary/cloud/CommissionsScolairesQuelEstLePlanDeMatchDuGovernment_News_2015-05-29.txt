Quebec - The member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for elementary and secondary education, Nicole Léger, reacted to the announcement made this morning, within the framework of the congress of the Federation of Quebec school boards, by the Minister of Education, François Blais, concerning the abolition of school elections.
“The status quo was no longer acceptable; the Parti Québécois has said so on several occasions. This announcement by the Minister is therefore not a surprise. However, we will remain vigilant to ensure that parents remain strongly represented in the new structure and that the regions retain their powers, ”said Nicole Léger.
Indeed, the Parti Québécois wants decision-making to remain close to families, parents and students. However, over the past year, the government has said a lot of things on this subject, but it has not presented anything concrete. “We have been asking this government for months to stop improvising behind closed doors and to work transparently with the education community. When will he table a concrete plan and hold a public consultation? We do not know in which direction the minister is going, when he has to answer several questions. What does he plan to do for the English-speaking community? How will the collection of school taxes be structured? What will be the place reserved for parents? Asked the spokesperson.
Nicole Léger also stressed that the changes announced should not obscure the fact that the government has cut brutally in education since coming to power, among other things in homework help, food aid, the purchase of books. and specialized services for children in difficulty. “Obviously, all of these cuts threaten the success of young people; unfortunately, the Liberals are too busy with structures to think about it, ”she concluded.
