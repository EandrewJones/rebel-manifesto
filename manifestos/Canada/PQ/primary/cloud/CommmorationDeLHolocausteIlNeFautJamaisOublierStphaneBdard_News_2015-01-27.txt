Quebec - The MNA for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, as well as the MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesperson for international relations, Carole Poirier, marked the International Day dedicated to the memory of the victims of the Holocaust.
“January 27, 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of the liberation by Allied forces of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and extermination camp in Poland. Out of respect for the hundreds of thousands of women, men and children who were detained or died there, we have an important duty to remember. As the number of survivors declines year after year, it is up to the rising generations to keep the memory of these tragic events alive and to continue to stand up for the dignity of every human being. Such an abomination must never happen again, ”declared Stéphane Bédard.
“Several decades after the fact, let us hope that we are now in a position to draw lessons from this dark and shameful page of human history. In particular, let us remember that racism, intolerance, prejudice or hatred have never led to any progress whatsoever. We must continue to fight them, in all their forms, ”added Carole Poirier.
