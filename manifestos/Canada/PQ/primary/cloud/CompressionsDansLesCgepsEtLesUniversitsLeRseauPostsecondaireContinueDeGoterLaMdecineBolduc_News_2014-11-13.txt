Quebec– The MNA for Joliette and official opposition spokesperson for higher education, Véronique Hivon, notes that the Minister of Higher Education, Yves Bolduc, not content with having already imposed record cuts for 2014 -2015, adds a layer today by further slashing both the college network and the university network.
“Does the Minister of Higher Education really believe that the cuts, which are doubled in CEGEPs, will have no effect on the quality of education and the support offered to young people? Is he really convinced that the new cuts to universities, which now reach almost $ 200 million, will not affect teaching or research? It&#39;s impossible! The Minister knows full well that he is directly attacking the quality of education, ”stated Véronique Hivon.
“Universities and CEGEPs are sources of knowledge and engines for innovation in Quebec. To cut directly in the network, to cut in education, knowledge, knowledge, research, it is to shoot oneself in the foot for the future, because these are areas to which we should give absolute priority, both for our social development and for our economic development, ”added the MP.
The politics of cynicism
“The liberal opposition denounced the financial situation of universities from all quarters. A few months later, the same people radically change their position and impose record cuts to the network. We now understand that the loud cries of the members of the Liberal Party were only an electoral strategy. After that, we wonder why Quebec voters are cynical, ”concluded the member for the Parti Québécois.
