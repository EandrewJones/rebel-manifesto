Quebec - The member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition critic for elementary and secondary education and school perseverance, Nicole Léger, says she is very worried about the consequences of the Liberal government&#39;s blind cuts to services students; indeed, some parents could withdraw their children from school for lack of adequate services to accompany and support them in their journey.
“The situation reported to us this morning in the media is absolutely sad. It is obvious, however, that all students, especially those with learning difficulties, must have access to the services they need to ensure their success. We cannot afford, as a society, to sacrifice an entire generation in the name of achieving balanced budgets; the damage would be too great, even irreparable, and that would not bode well for the future, ”said Nicole Léger.
“The government may repeat that it is making the education of our young people one of its priorities, its actions show the opposite; for 2015-2016, cuts of the order of $ 200 million are expected in elementary and secondary schools, there is talk of increasing the number of students per class without taking into account the fact that some are experiencing difficulties, and the number professionals - such as speech therapists, psychologists or remedial teachers, to name a few - will be drastically reduced. For some families, therefore, it is a real obstacle course that looms, ”continued the spokesperson.
During the last parliamentary session, the leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, as well as the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles illustrated their concerns in this regard by giving them a concrete name and face, which made move the government a few times. &quot;If I have to take each case, one by one, to the minister to get him moving, I will.&quot; Because what matters, at the end of the day, is that our young people are equipped to succeed, ”concluded Nicole Léger.
