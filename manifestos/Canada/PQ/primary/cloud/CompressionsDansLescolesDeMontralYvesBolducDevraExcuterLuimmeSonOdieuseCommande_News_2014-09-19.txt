Quebec - The member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for elementary and secondary education and school perseverance, Nicole Léger, notes that the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports, Yves Bolduc himself will have to do the dirty work of cutting directly into student services in Montreal schools.
“For months, the Liberal minister has acted as if he were not primarily responsible for the cuts in services that are hitting all students in Quebec head-on. He is incapable of assuming his responsibilities. The quasi-supervision of the Commission scolaire de Montréal (CSDM), decreed by Yves Bolduc, shows on the contrary that these massive cuts, in particular in homework assistance and in food aid, are remote-controlled by the minister himself and his government, ”said Nicole Léger.
Remember that Minister Yves Bolduc is demanding cuts of $ 90 million in aid for academic success, $ 10 million in special education for the most vulnerable students, and $ 30 million in so-called &quot;additional&quot; allowances. , and this only for the year 2014-2015. “The Minister of Education is cutting $ 130 million in direct aid to students in difficulty and he imagines that this will not have concrete effects on the ground! It is totally disconnected, ”added the member for the Parti Québécois.
Bolduc, a failing student
“Minister Yves Bolduc has his forehead all around his head; he dares to give lessons on public finances, while he did not hesitate to take advantage of a loophole in a compensation program that he himself created to put $ 215,000 in his pockets. Prime Minister Philippe Couillard must understand that his Minister of Education is a failed student. He has a duty to replace him, ”concluded Nicole Léger.
