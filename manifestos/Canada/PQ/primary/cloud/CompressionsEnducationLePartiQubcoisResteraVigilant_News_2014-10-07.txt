Quebec - The member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition critic for elementary and secondary education and school perseverance, Nicole Léger, will remain vigilant following the adoption, today at the &#39;National Assembly, a motion urging the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Yves Bolduc, to send a clear ministerial directive to schools so that there are no cuts in direct services to students, which includes help with homework, food aid, and the prevention of bullying and violence at school.
“That the Parti Québécois motion was adopted unanimously is good news. However, there are still several unanswered questions. What exactly will this directive say? When will it be sent to school boards? Will the minister content himself with sending his directive without ensuring that it is followed? », Raised Nicole Léger.
Minister Yves Bolduc will have to be transparent by making this directive public, as soon as it has been sent to schools. “There is no way the minister will try another magic trick to disempower himself. This time, he will not be able to be satisfied with pious wishes; he will have to take action to reverse the cuts in student services that he himself had remote-controlled in Quebec schools.
