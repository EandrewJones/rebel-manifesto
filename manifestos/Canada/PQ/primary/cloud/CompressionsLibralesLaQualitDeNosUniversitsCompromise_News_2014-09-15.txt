Quebec– The MNA for Joliette and official opposition critic for higher education, Véronique Hivon, notes with concern that the quality of teaching and research in Quebec universities is compromised.
“The Liberal Party denounced the financial situation of universities for months. However, we learn today that the Liberal government is imposing record cuts of at least $ 172 million on universities. Not only will these massive cuts affect all university players, but it will also encourage cynicism among the population, who now see that the indignant cries of the Liberal Party were nothing but bad theater, ”laments the member for the Parti Québécois.
While in opposition, the Liberal Party, through MP Pierre Arcand, denounced the financial situation of universities by saying that higher education institutions were navigating &quot;in a thick fog&quot; and that they &quot; they were screaming famine. ” We now see that all this was just a political maneuver and that the reinvestment plan in the universities of the Parti Québécois government is being scrapped.
More &quot;Bolduc cuts&quot;
The Minister of Higher Education, Yves Bolduc, cannot simply ask universities to slash massively and then wash their hands. “Those responsible for these cuts that will affect universities are Minister Bolduc and his government. There is no way they will dissociate themselves from it, ”continued Véronique Hivon.
Are Tuition Fee Commitments at Risk?
Given the massive cuts in CEGEPs and universities, the Liberal government must confirm its commitments not to increase tuition fees in universities beyond indexation and not to change the bill for CEGEPs. &quot;Faced with a Minister of Higher Education who does not seem to have a vision for education and a government that has never hesitated to question accessibility to education, students must be reassured,&quot; said concluded the spokesperson.
