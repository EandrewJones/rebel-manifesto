Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu– The MNA for Joliette and official opposition critic for higher education, Véronique Hivon, denounces the record cuts of $ 200 million made to Quebec universities; In light of the information unveiled in recent days, we can indeed see that they directly affect the quality and competitiveness of the Quebec university network.
“For several months, the Minister of Higher Education, Yves Bolduc, tried to make people believe that the massive cuts in universities would not have concrete effects on the ground. We knew that it did not hold water, and we now have proof of it: among other consequences, hundreds of courses are canceled, faculties are merged or outright abolished, positions are cut and professors could see their salaries reduced. By doing the right thing, the government is deliberately attacking the quality of teaching and research, and it is washing its hands of the devastating impacts that flow from its decisions. In the name of transparency, the Minister must now table details of all the services that will be affected by the cuts in our universities, ”claimed Véronique Hivon.
“As soon as the quality of education is reached, the competitiveness of the Quebec network, and therefore of Quebec, will be affected compared to the rest of the world. As if it was not enough that Philippe Couillard does not have a plan or a vision to revive the economy and employment in Quebec, now he is cutting, without any qualms, in education, knowledge and knowledge, that is to say in what constitutes the greatest wealth of a society: its gray matter, ”continued the Member for Joliette.
“While in opposition, less than a year ago, members of the Liberal Party tore their shirts to denounce the underfunding of universities. A few months later, they accept that their government orders massive cuts in the network, without worrying for a second about the consequences. It is a sad example of cynicism and political soliciting, ”concluded Véronique Hivon.
