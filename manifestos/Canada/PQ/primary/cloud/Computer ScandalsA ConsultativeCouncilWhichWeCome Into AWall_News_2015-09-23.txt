Quebec - The member for Sanguinet and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois for the Conseil du trésor and in matters of retirement plans, the economy, exports and information resources, Alain Therrien, notes that the Quebec advisory council of technologies of information, set up by the Secretariat of the Treasury Board, lost much of its legitimacy with the withdrawal of the Professional Association of Free Software Companies (APELL).
“APELL considers that the government is not taking the right path to settle computer scandals. Stuffed with large private firms which already control the sector, the Council&#39;s conclusions will certainly go in the direction of their interests, ”denounced the deputy for Sanguinet.
Indeed, APELL teaches us that the solutions proposed by the Council will favor the big players, will weaken the competition and, above all, will not help the Quebec SMEs in the IT field which need a gateway. entry to develop. “We are witnessing a repetition of what happened in 2004, when the government of Jean Charest also brought together consulting engineering firms and the Ministry of Transport within a consultation committee. Shortly after, we could see what this strategy had produced in terms of collusion, corruption and cost overruns. Are we seeing the same thing at the Conseil du trésor? Some clues lead us to think so, ”continued the member for Sanguinet.
“The Liberals and the President of the Treasury Board, Martin Coiteux, have a bias in favor of large IT firms and the private sector: six of the ten IT firms that receive the most contracts each year are sitting with the minister to find solutions cost overruns. It&#39;s like asking the wolf how to make the henhouse better kept! Minister Coiteux must listen to what groups like APELL have to offer, ”concluded Alain Therrien.
