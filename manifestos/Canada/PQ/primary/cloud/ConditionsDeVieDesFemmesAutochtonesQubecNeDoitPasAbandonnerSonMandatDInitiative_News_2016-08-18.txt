Quebec, August 17, 2016 - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and Parti Québécois spokesperson on the status of women, Carole Poirier, insists that the government not use the federal inquiry as a pretext to abandon the mandate of initiative on the living conditions of indigenous women, particularly in matters of conjugal and sexual violence. Rather, it calls for rapid and concrete action on the part of the government which finally takes into account the multiple investigation reports.
“In the wake of the testimonies gathered by the program Enquête sur le fate des femmes autochtones, last October, several elected members of the Parti Québécois traveled to Val d&#39;Or to meet with stakeholders in the region. We were then able to observe the fragility of the environment and the need to investigate the disturbing events that affected the communities. Since then, we have been asking the government to shed light on what is happening in Val d&#39;Or by giving a mandate to this effect to the Independent Investigations Office, ”explained Carole Poirier.
“However, in response to the events in Val-d&#39;Or, the government contented itself with making a few quick visits and announcing minor and inadequate measures, no doubt hoping to put the lid on the pot. He even had the nerve to appoint an observer without consulting the indigenous leaders first. Finally, although the government made a commitment to entrust the Val-d&#39;Or investigation to the Independent Investigations Bureau, last April, nothing has changed since. It is unacceptable, ”concluded the spokesperson.
