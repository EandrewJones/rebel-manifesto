Quebec - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of health, access to care and home support, Diane Lamarre, calls for an investigation by the Québec Ombudsman into the extremely disturbing allegations concerning the CHU Sainte-Justine reported by Radio -Canada today.
“What nurses are denouncing today is a lack of resources which would not only not meet the needs of patients, but which would also endanger the lives of mothers and newborns. This time around, the Minister of Health cannot refute the facts, as he usually does. The Québec Ombudsman must investigate to shed light on the matter and to correct the situation, ”said Diane Lamarre. This recalls in passing that the head of the obstetrics and gynecology department is not surprised that nurses are currently in &quot;distress&quot;, nor that she attributes the events &quot;to budget cuts&quot;.
“Quebecers will not be satisfied with Minister Barrette&#39;s cookie-cutter declaration, who once again trivializes the situation by stigmatizing the people on the ground. The intervention of the Ombudsperson is necessary to establish the facts, find solutions and dispel any doubts in the population as to the quality of the services offered in Sainte-Justine, ”concluded the spokesperson.
