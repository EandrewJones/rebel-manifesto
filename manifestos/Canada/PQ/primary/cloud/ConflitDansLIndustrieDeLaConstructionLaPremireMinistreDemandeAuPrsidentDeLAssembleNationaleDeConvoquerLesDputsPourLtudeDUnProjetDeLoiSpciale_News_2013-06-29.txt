Montreal - The Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, asked the President of the National Assembly to make the necessary arrangements for the Assembly to meet in an extraordinary session in order to allow the presentation of a bill aimed at the resumption of work in the construction industry, this Sunday, June 30 at 9.45 a.m.
“Over the past few weeks, the government has said on numerous occasions that it wants the two parties to come to a negotiated agreement on a voluntary basis. Unfortunately, I see an impasse in the negotiations and that there is still no agreement at the institutional-commercial and industrial table. I therefore asked the President of the National Assembly to bring together the deputies as a matter of urgency to have a special bill adopted in order to put an end to the conflict, ”declared the Prime Minister.
At the start of the conflict, three negotiation tables aimed to determine standards for construction workers in Quebec. An agreement in principle was reached in the civil engineering and roadwork sector on Monday, June 24, and another was concluded on June 26 in the residential sector, thus demonstrating that negotiated agreements in this area are possible.
On June 24, due to an impasse in the negotiations at the institutional-commercial and industrial table, the Premier appointed a special mediator, Normand Gauthier, to bring the management and union parties to the conclusion of a negotiated agreement on &#39;by the end of the week. Unfortunately, it seems that this could not be possible in this sector.
The deputies will begin their work on Sunday, June 30 with the goal that Tuesday morning, all the sites of Quebec will be in activity.
