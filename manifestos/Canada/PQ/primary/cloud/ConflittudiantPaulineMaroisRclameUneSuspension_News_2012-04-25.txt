Quebec- Reacting to the latest developments in the discussion between the Liberal government and student associations, the Leader of the Official Opposition and Member of Parliament for Charlevoix, Pauline Marois, is calling for a suspension of the tuition fee hike scheduled for next September.
“After 10 weeks of conflict, the exasperation is at its height. Despite the call for calm, unfortunate events have occurred and we unreservedly condemn them since the start of the conflict. It is time for spirits to cool down, ”said Pauline Marois.
“The tension is palpable and leads to uncontrolled movements. Currently, this situation is an integral part of the strategy of Jean Charest who seeks to divide the student movement and to use them for partisan purposes, ”denounced Pauline Marois.
The leader of the official opposition thus takes up the idea put forward by some public figures who have proposed a suspension of the increase in tuition fees of $ 325 which is decreed for next September. &quot;We must at all costs stop acts of violence, save the student session and discuss calmly,&quot; she added.
The Prime Minister must assume his responsibilities and take the matter in hand, ”concluded Pauline Marois.
