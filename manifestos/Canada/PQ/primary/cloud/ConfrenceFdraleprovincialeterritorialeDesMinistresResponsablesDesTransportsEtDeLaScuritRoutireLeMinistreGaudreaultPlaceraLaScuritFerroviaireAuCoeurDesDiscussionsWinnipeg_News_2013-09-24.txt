Quebec - The Minister of Transport, Sylvain Gaudreault, will travel to Winnipeg on September 25 to meet his counterparts from the federal, provincial and territorial governments, on the occasion of the Federal-Provincial-Territorial Conference of Ministers responsible for transport and road safety. At the request of the Government of Quebec, issues related to rail safety will be on the agenda of this meeting.
“The safety of our modern transport services, both for people and for goods, is paramount. The tragic train accident that occurred on July 6 in the municipality of Lac-Mégantic placed this issue among our most pressing concerns. This tragedy illustrates how imperative it is to maintain rigorous security measures, ”said Minister Gaudreault.
&quot;I intend to take advantage of this meeting to present Quebec&#39;s vision in the field of transport and security, while respecting everyone&#39;s skills,&quot; concluded Mr. Gaudreault.
