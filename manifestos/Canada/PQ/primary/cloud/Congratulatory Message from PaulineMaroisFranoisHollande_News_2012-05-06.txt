Quebec - Here is the message from the Leader of the Official Opposition and Member of Parliament for Charlevoix, Pauline Marois, to François Hollande, President-elect of the French Republic:
“Mr. President-elect,
Tonight, the French people have chosen you to preside over their future for the next five years.
I would like to express my warmest congratulations to you and, through me, those of the Parti Québécois.
Your great victory is the fruit of a brilliant campaign that you have waged over the past few months and which we have followed with particular attention. You have managed to bring together a majority of French people around an ambitious and inspiring project.
The message expressed this evening by the French people will be heard, I am sure, well beyond your borders. The strength of your proposals and the vision you expressed during the electoral campaign give hope and new perspectives to meet the immense challenges that France and Europe will have to face.
Quebec and France have long maintained a privileged relationship through the particular ties of our history and also because we share common values. I am confident that this relationship, always placed under the sign of friendship, will be further strengthened in the coming years. Rest assured that you can count on my political training and my support.
Please accept, Mr. President-elect, the assurance of my highest consideration. &quot;
