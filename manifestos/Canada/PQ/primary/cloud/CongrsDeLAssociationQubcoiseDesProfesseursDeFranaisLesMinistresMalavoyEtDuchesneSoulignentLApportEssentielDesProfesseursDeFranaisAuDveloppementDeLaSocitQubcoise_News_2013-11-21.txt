“Fluency in French is an important factor in academic success and perseverance. I know that French teachers make considerable efforts to encourage as many young people as possible to succeed and learn about Quebec culture. They are key partners in the educational success of young Quebecers, ”said Minister Malavoy.
Minister Duchesne, for his part, paid tribute to the essential contribution of French teachers to the development of French-speaking research. Support for research in French is also one of the lines of action of the national research and innovation policy that he unveiled last October.
“Quebec is today a major player in the development and dissemination of knowledge in the French language. It is in large part thanks to them that Quebec occupies this enviable place within the Francophonie. They know how to pass on a taste for language and culture to their students and I would like to salute the work they are doing in this direction ”indicated Minister Duchesne.
The Minister took the opportunity to announce that she will soon unveil the measures she intends to implement to strengthen the learning of French. &quot;By choosing the theme of their Délier la langue conference, French teachers reveal the spirit that animates them, that of freedom, commitment and access to knowledge.&quot; There is no doubt that the pride of living in French is learned, lived and developed in school, ”the minister concluded.
