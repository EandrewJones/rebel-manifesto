Quebec - The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Member of Parliament for Jonquière, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, took advantage of his participation in the meeting of the Council of Ministers responsible for Transport and Security route, in Fredericton, New Brunswick, to present the Quebec vision of transportation.
The Minister underlined that for Quebec, a vision of the development of transport involves a notable reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, associated with a reduction in energy consumption. To achieve this, public transport, which will have to be considered in an integrated policy, will be at the heart of the Quebec transport vision. This sector will be one of the spearheads that will lead Quebec towards its energy independence. The Government of Quebec has the firm intention of embarking on this path.
“This meeting was also an opportunity to remind people that Quebec is keen to respect its jurisdiction in the area of transportation. I have argued that, in renewing its infrastructure investment programs, the federal government&#39;s approach will need to be predicated on predictable funding. By knowing the resources available in the long term, we will be able to do better planning. In addition, Quebec will ensure that it receives the share it is owed in the federal funds that will be made available over the next few years, ”said Minister Gaudreault.
Remember that the Council of Ministers responsible for Transportation and Road Safety in Canada generally meets once a year to deal with issues of interest to all governments. The previous meeting of this council dated back to September 2010, in Halifax.
