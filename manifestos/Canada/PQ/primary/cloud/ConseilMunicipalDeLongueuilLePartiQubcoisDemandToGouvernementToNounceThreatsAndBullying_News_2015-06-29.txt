Québec - The member for Matane-Matapédia and official opposition critic for public security, Pascal Bérubé, as well as the members of the Parti Québécois de Longueuil, Martine Ouellet (Vachon), Diane Lamarre (Taillon) and Bernard Drainville (Marie-Victorin), ask the government to clearly denounce the intimidation suffered by the mayor of Longueuil, Caroline St-Hilaire.
Last week, Ms. St-Hilaire denounced the excesses of the Leader of the Opposition, Robert Myles, who claims that Longueuil is a bilingual city. She also asked the government to strengthen Law 101 in order to clarify the rules in this area. However, following a series of threats against her, the police decided to ensure the safety of Ms. St-Hilaire.
A few days ago, questioned on this subject, the Minister of Transport, Robert Poëti, declared: &quot;Me, if she has a problem, she will have to settle it there!&quot; It&#39;s not my responsibility (sic)… ”
“For several days now, security has been reinforced around the mayoress of Longueuil. However, the government has not clearly denounced the threats and intimidation to which Caroline St-Hilaire is the victim; rather, he sent mixed messages. Where are the ministers of municipal affairs, public security and the minister responsible for the fight against bullying? They must send a clear message and disagree against the words of Robert Poëti, ”claimed Pascal Bérubé.
“Law 101 provides that municipalities can communicate with their citizens and offer services in English when more than 50% of their population declares themselves English-speaking; it is a measure that no one is questioning. In Longueuil, the vast majority of citizens identify French as their first language. It is not normal for an elected official, wherever he is in Quebec, to suffer intimidation, even threats, because he reminds us that French is the common language of public use in Quebec ”, have added Martine Ouellet, Diane Lamarre and Bernard Drainville.
