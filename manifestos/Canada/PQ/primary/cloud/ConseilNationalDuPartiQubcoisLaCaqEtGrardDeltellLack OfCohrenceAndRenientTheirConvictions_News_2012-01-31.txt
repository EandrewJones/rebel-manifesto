Montreal - Following the national council of the Parti Québécois, François Legault&#39;s spokesperson in the National Assembly, Gérard Deltell, made statements which were surprising to say the least, vigorously denouncing the proposals adopted by the militants of the Parti Québécois.
“By accusing the Parti Québécois of being disconnected, Mr. Deltell ignores the positions he himself has already defended. Before making such statements which in no way raise the political debate, Gérard Deltell should have remembered that in August 2011, by way of a press release, he accused the Parti Québécois of having stolen the ideas of the ADQ. What a lack of consistency! », Declared the president of the national executive council, Raymond Archambault.
“Gérard Deltell should also remember that in 2000, the former head of the ADQ, Mario Dumont, tabled a bill in the National Assembly on popular initiative referendums. On the subject of defectors, MM. Legault and Deltell should take cognizance of the position defended by the member for La Peltrie, now a member of the CAQ. In February 2011, Éric Caire tabled a bill in the National Assembly concerning the dismissal of deputies, ”added Raymond Archambault.
“We knew that the new Caquist deputies were a turn-off, today we have more proof of it. How can they denounce the proposals adopted by the Parti Québécois when they claimed paternity a few months ago? », Concluded Raymond Archambault, recalling that the Parti Québécois is the most important political formation in Quebec with its 90,000 members.
