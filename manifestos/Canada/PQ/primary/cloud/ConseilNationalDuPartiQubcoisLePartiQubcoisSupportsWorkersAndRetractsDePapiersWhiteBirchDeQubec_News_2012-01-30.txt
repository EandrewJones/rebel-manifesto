Montreal - Gathered in Montreal, the 500 Parti Québécois activists present at their national council adopted a proposal supporting the efforts of the workers aimed at ensuring the relaunch of the Papiers White Birch factory in Quebec. The resolution proposed by the constituencies of Taschereau and Jean-Lesage reads as follows:
It is proposed that the national council demand that the parliamentary wing demand from the government energetic gestures to ensure the relaunch of the Papiers White Birch factory in Quebec and to protect the pension fund of workers and retirees of the factory and that the Parti Québécois announce its support for the workers&#39; cooperative project that could be implemented by the workers of White Birch Papers in order to save their factory and their jobs.
“This is a clear message sent by the Parti Québécois. We want the government to act energetically to preserve jobs and the pension fund at the Papiers White Birch factory in Quebec. Thousands of workers have dedicated their lives to making this factory a profitable and prosperous business for the region, ”said Taschereau MNA Agnès Maltais.
“The owners of the plant have made a lot of money thanks to the quality of the region&#39;s workforce and the natural resources that belong to the Quebec community. Plant workers, their families and hundreds of contractors have been living in anguish since the news of the plant&#39;s closure was announced. The government cannot let them go and must act now with determination, ”concluded the Parti Québécois candidate in Jean-Lesage, Pierre Châteauvert.
Should negotiations fail, the Parti Québécois has also expressed its full support for the workers&#39; cooperative project that could be set in motion.
