Quebec - The MNA for Joliette and official opposition critic for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, and the MNA for Rimouski, Harold LeBel, welcome with relief the decline of the Minister of Culture and Communications, Hélène David, about the closing of conservatories in the region. However, they will remain vigilant.
“We are obviously very happy to note that following the outcry caused by this anticipated closure in the community and the very vigorous mobilization of the population, the Minister finally heard reason. It is backing down on the closure of conservatories in the region. This decision is salutary; it was necessary in order to be able to safeguard the development of talent, musical expression and the arts throughout Quebec, ”declared Véronique Hivon.
Harold LeBel, for his part, wanted to underline the great mobilization of the entire Rimouski community against the closure of his conservatory.
“It is certain that all this mobilization made see the good sense to Hélène David. Now, the minister has promised that she will go to the regions to meet people. I ask him for transparency; she must meet everyone and not do it in secret. It is very important that the Minister listen to the citizens and partners who have mobilized, ”added the Member for Rimouski.
“We wonder why the minister did not close the door two weeks ago, when the first rumors began to circulate. I would also like to thank all the people who mobilized; the minister must now remember that what must be done is to consult and listen to the people on the ground, who know better than anyone how conservatoires are flagship institutions for the regions and for their cultural dynamism », Concluded Véronique Hivon.
