Quebec - Sylvain Gaudreault, the member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and the environment, asks the Minister of the Environment to quickly review the use of curbside recycling and public consignment for wine bottles, and to act to remedy the glass crisis in Quebec.
“The selective glass collection system faces major economic and environmental challenges; currently, most of the glass recovered by selective collection is not recycled. We ask the Minister to quickly look into ways to facilitate the recycling of wine bottles, in particular the deposit, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
Remember that a study is currently being carried out by the Research Center in Environmental Economics, Agrifood, Transport and Energy (CREATE) at Laval University; The recovery and recycling systems are analyzed from various angles to determine the most advantageous for the recovery of non-refillable beverage containers.
“In the interests of consumers, industry and the environment, the Minister must make a rigorous and informed decision. We expect him to make public, as soon as possible, the analysis of the performance of selective collection and deposit systems, so that the best possible choice can be made, ”concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
