Quebec - The MP for Jonquière and leader of the official opposition, Sylvain Gaudreault, as well as the MP for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and Parti Québécois spokesperson for international relations, Carole Poirier, underlined the transfer of powers which took place at the Consulate General of France in Quebec.
“It is with gratitude that we greet the outgoing Consul General, Mr. Nicolas Chibaeff. Since taking office in October 2012, his contribution to the harmony and deepening of relations between France and Quebec has been considerable, in addition to being marked by a sincere attachment to Quebec, its people and to its culture, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
“Mr. Chibaeff greatly facilitated the official visits that Ms. Pauline Marois, as Premier of Quebec, made to France during her mandate. He is also the one who worked to ensure that Mr. Jean-Marc Ayrault&#39;s visit to Quebec went smoothly, as part of the Alternate Meeting of French and Quebec Prime Ministers, in 2013. On behalf of my fellow members of the Parti Québécois, I thank him for his great professionalism, his generosity and his constant courtesy, ”added Carole Poirier.
The leader of the official opposition also welcomes Ms. Laurence Haguenauer, who takes over from Mr. Chibaeff at the head of the Consulate General of France in Quebec. “I welcome the arrival of Ms. Haguenauer and assure her of the full cooperation of the members of the official opposition. Knowing that she already knows Quebec well, I am confident that she will effectively contribute to defending and promoting the direct and privileged relationship that has existed between France and Quebec for a long time, ”he concluded.
