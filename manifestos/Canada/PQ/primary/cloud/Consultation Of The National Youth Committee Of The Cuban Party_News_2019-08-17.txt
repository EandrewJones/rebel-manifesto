Montreal, Saturday, August 17, 2019 - As part of the revival of the Parti Québécois, the CNJPQ today organized in Montreal a consultation with its young members. More than 90 people came to the site to participate in the discussions and have their opinions heard. Pascal Bérubé, parliamentary leader of the Parti Québécois and MP for Matane-Matapédia, Véronique Hivon, MP for Joliette and Sylvain Gaudreault, MP for Jonquière, were also present.
Among the results of the consultation, we note 67% support for frequent consultation of members and supporters in order to guide parliamentary action, 62% for sending representatives to congresses of other separatist parties, and 84% to oblige the leader, the parliamentary wing, the national executive and the political committee to consult the youth wing on questions concerning youth. These results will directly influence the main proposal that will be unveiled in the coming weeks for the Extraordinary National Congress on November 9 and 10.
“Here I see conviction, passion, hope. This hope we will help you carry it. The Parti Québécois, this great independence movement, is able to transform itself thanks to you. Over the next few months and years, the most stimulating place to campaign will be at the Parti Québécois and the CNJPQ! »Proclaimed Pascal Bérubé, parliamentary leader of the Parti Québécois.
“Bravo to all the young people for these beautiful discussions, these beautiful exchanges. I am proud to see so many of you ready to roll up your sleeves to work for the revival of the Party and the country project. We are now eager to bring your ideas and your requests to the national executive and to the Extraordinary National Congress in November to build a Parti Québécois that looks like you! »Concluded Frédérique St-Jean, president of the CNJPQ.
