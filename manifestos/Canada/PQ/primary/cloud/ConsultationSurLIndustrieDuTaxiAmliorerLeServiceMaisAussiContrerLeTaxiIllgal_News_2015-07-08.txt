The member was participating today in the consultation on the taxi transportation industry organized by the Department of Transport.
“The improvement of the taxi service is already underway, several great initiatives such as the development of mobile applications, GPS systems, fast payment methods, electric vehicles, and many others, are on the table today. . Like any industry, the taxi industry must modernize, but an improvement in service alone will not be able to compete with a competitor who does not respect any rules and who does not pay QST, no GST, no tax and no permit. The minister keeps repeating that he is opposed to UberX, but does not take any concrete action to stop it once and for all. He must intervene before the situation escalates, as is currently the case in France, ”said Martine Ouellet.
All the stakeholders in the taxi industry gathered today at the Palais des congrès de Montréal to discuss the future of the sector. Several topics were on the agenda, such as payment methods, pricing, driver training, passenger safety, among others. Unfortunately, the means to counter the illegal UberX taxi were not on the program.
“Despite numerous requests from the industry, Minister Poëti refused to discuss the means to counter illegal taxi companies. Obviously, seizures are ineffective in stopping the illegal taxi, as it has continued to grow since its arrival in Quebec. People in the industry have ideas, they wanted to express themselves on the subject. It is unfortunate that the Minister refused to hear them, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
