Quebec - Having learned that the Liberal candidate announced for the by-election to be held in the riding of Fabre is none other than Monique Sauvé, the former president of the Réseau des carrefours jeunesse-emploi, the member for Saint-Jean and porte- word of the Parti Québécois pour la jeunesse, Dave Turcotte, wonders if the person who participated, last Thursday, in the consultations on the new government youth policy spoke on behalf of the young people of Quebec and the carrefours jeunesse-emploi (CJE), or the name of the future liberal candidate.
“Obviously, the Liberals have the right to choose their candidate. However, it is legitimate to ask when, exactly, the rapprochement between the Liberal Party and Monique Sauvé took place. In recent weeks, especially last Thursday, when she spoke during the consultations on the government&#39;s future youth policy, for what interests was she working? His own, those of the Liberal Party or those of young people from Quebec? Moreover, did she benefit from more listening on the part of the government, knowing that she was going to become its candidate? »Asked Dave Turcotte.
“I would very much like the Prime Minister to finally be transparent; he must tell us how many other people he has promised a Liberal candidacy in exchange for their silence regarding the cuts he is imposing on young people, regions, families and the middle class, among others, ”concluded Dave Turcotte. .
