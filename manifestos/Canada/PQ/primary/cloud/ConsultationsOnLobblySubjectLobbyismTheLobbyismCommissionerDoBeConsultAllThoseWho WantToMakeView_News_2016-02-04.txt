Quebec - In response to the Lobbyists Commissioner&#39;s announced desire to invite only twenty groups to his consultations on the subjugation of non-profit organizations (NPOs) to the law on lobbying, the leader of the official opposition and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois responsible for the reform of democratic institutions, Bernard Drainville, asks him to consult all those who want to be heard.
For the time being, only 22 groups linked to NPOs have been convened, while more than 60,000 NPOs will be affected by Bill 56. Among the organizations that want to be heard, there are community organizations with little financial and human resources that take care of fragile clienteles across Quebec. The Commissioner must hear them.
In addition, the decision to hold private consultations in Montreal and Quebec City also poses a problem, since the community organizations and NPOs concerned are found throughout Quebec. The Commissioner&#39;s hearings must therefore be held in the regions, not only in Quebec City and Montreal.
“One of the fundamental principles of the law on lobbying is transparency. And what does the Commissioner do? He is holding hearings which will not be public. This is nonsense. Its consultations should be public, even if it means webcasting them, ”said Bernard Drainville.
The current consultations follow a request from the former Minister responsible for the Reform of Democratic Institutions, Jean-Marc Fournier, who wanted the Lobbyists Commissioner to discuss with NPOs in order to analyze the usefulness and relevance of their subject to the Lobbying Act, as proposed in Bill 56. Minister Fournier has mandated the Commissioner to produce a report on various possible solutions to this issue. &quot;But, with this decision, the Commissioner goes against the wishes of Jean-Marc Fournier, who wanted a full picture of the situation for the purposes of consultations on Bill 56,&quot; concluded Bernard Drainville.
