Quebec - Following the special consultations held this week on Bill 14 on mining, the MP for Vachon and official opposition critic for mining, Martine Ouellet, has come to an obvious conclusion: The mining bill does nothing to address the squandering of our natural resources.
The important question of royalties is still missing from Bill 14, just as it was in the now defunct Bill 79. A year and two consultations later, we are at the same point. “The Liberal government did not listen to the people. Despite Prime Minister Jean Charest&#39;s assertion last May to the effect that he was ready to debate the issue of royalties in Bill 14, Minister Simard has so far closed the door ”, indicated Martine. Ouellet.
“The majority of groups came to tell us that the royalties were not enough. Quebec and the regions must benefit from the exploitation of our natural resources. Unfortunately, the Charest government made economic development worthy of the colonial era. It brings us straight back to the time of Duplessis and even worse! At least at that time, the mining companies built their infrastructure at their own expense, now with the Plan Nord, the entire population will pay, ”said Martine Ouellet.
“The Charest government, through its Minister for Natural Resources and Wildlife, will have to redo its homework and completely overhaul its bill to include the important issue of royalties so that the Parti Québécois l &#39;press. Natural resources belong to all Quebecers and we absolutely must regain control of them now, ”said Member for Vachon.
“Other issues such as transparency, independence of consultations, expropriation, exclusion of urban and resort areas from exploration and the level of fines were also discussed during this consultation. The bill falls short and it is clear that major changes are necessary to ensure better protection of the environment and respect for local communities, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
