Quebec - While a company run by relatives of the Liberal Party, Aviseo Conseil, received a contract of nearly $ 100,000 from the Ministry of Finance, without a call for tenders, to assess the benefits of the Energy East project, the chief of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, demanded that the Prime Minister launch a public call for tenders for this contract.
“True to form, the Liberal government has a very relative vision of independence. The new firm Aviseo Conseil is actually headed by Pierre Lefebvre who, under Monique Jérôme-Forget, led the Liberal government to the fiasco of university mega-hospitals in PPP. Worse still, the second shareholder of Aviseo Conseil is Jean-Pierre Lessard, a former colleague of the current chief of staff of the Minister of Finance, Guillaume Caudron. Can the Prime Minister explain to us how the Minister of Finance was able to award, without a call for tenders, a contract of nearly $ 100,000 to a person close to his chief of staff, who is also known to have overestimated roughly the economic benefits of the Plan Nord? “Asked Pierre Karl Péladeau.
Indeed, in February 2012, Jean-Pierre Lessard and Guillaume Caudron co-signed and published in the pages of several newspapers an outrageously complacent assessment of the Plan Nord. The text was titled Spinoffs of 148 Billion.
“The Minister of Finance himself announced the award of the contract without a call for tenders to Aviseo Conseil, while experts from the Ministry of Finance are also producing such analyzes. We ask the Prime Minister to make public the assessments and analyzes made by the Department of Finance on the economic benefits of the Energy East project. Moreover, in light of the facts revealed today, does Philippe Couillard undertake to launch a public call for tenders for the award of this contract? », Concluded the leader of the Parti Québécois.
