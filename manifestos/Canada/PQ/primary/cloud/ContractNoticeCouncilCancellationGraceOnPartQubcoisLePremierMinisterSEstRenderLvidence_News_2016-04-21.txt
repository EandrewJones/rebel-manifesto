Quebec - The member for Sanguinet and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, notes with satisfaction that the Liberal Prime Minister Philippe Couillard has finally canceled the contract that his government had signed with the firm Aviseo Advice.
“The Prime Minister has realized the obvious. We did not want a complacent or exaggerated report on the impact of the eventual Energy East project. The government wanted to give the contract to people with personal ties to the office of the Minister of Finance, the same people who had grossly overestimated the benefits of the Plan Nord in order to put the pill down. This is another step back from the Liberal government, and we can regret that it took 48 hours. It has become a habit with the Prime Minister: we reveal a situation and he waits two days before reacting. It&#39;s a 48 hour government! », Declared Alain Therrien.
Recall that in February 2012, Jean-Pierre Lessard, second shareholder of Aviseo Conseil, and his former colleague Guillaume Caudron, the current chief of staff of the Minister of Finance, co-signed and published in the pages of several newspapers an evaluation outrageously complacent of the Plan Nord. The text was titled Spinoffs of 148 Billion.
“Today the government is canceling the contract, when it was in fact preparing to pass us a pipeline! Quebecers are not fooled, we had already played in that film with the Plan Nord. Thanks to our interventions, we will be able to have a portrait of the analyzes that can be carried out by the Ministry of Finance, ”concluded Alain Therrien.
