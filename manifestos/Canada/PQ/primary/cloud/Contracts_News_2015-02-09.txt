Quebec - The member for Bonaventure and official opposition spokesperson for information resources, Sylvain Roy, asks the President of the Treasury Board, Martin Coiteux, to act concretely and quickly in the file of computer contracts given to the external, the cost of which will reach $ 1 billion this year.
“An article published this morning demonstrates the Liberals&#39; total loss of control over computers in Quebec. Since they regained power, the practices that were in place between 2003 and 2012 have returned with regard to IT consultants. In this period of liberal austerity, when the government is cutting everywhere and families are paying the price, where is the logic in giving $ 1 billion in external contracts? We know that Martin Coiteux abandoned all the initiatives of the Parti Québécois government in this matter, in particular with regard to centers of expertise and free software. But, for the rest, we still do not know what he will do. However, from what we know of the situation, we must act now, ”insisted Sylvain Roy.
We pay the price for the loss of expertise
The member also recalled that the cuts and layoffs carried out by the Liberal governments in the public service over the past 10 years have meant that the State has lost its expertise and must now pay a high price for external resources. To make up for this deficit, the Parti Québécois government had planned to create two centers of expertise in computer science, in Rimouski and Chicoutimi. He had also planned the establishment of a center of expertise for free software. Unfortunately, all of these initiatives were held back by the Liberal government.
“The loss of expertise in our public service is damaging on several fronts. In IT, it translates into astronomical costs for taxpayers. We had taken steps to really tackle the problem, but the Liberal government stopped everything. He must wake up and continue the projects that our government had put in place, ”concluded Sylvain Roy.
