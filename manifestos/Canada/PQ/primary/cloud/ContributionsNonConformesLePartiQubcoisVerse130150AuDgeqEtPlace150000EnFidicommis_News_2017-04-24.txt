Following the complaints of the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec (DGEQ) of March 10 and April 20, the Parti Québécois announces that it has made two payments representing the totality of the amounts claimed. Also, the political party confirms having placed $ 150,000 in trust for the duration of the dispute of the claims of December 2016.
The first payment, made on April 10, 2017, corresponds to $ 69,200, i.e. the total amount of the notice received on March 10, 2017. The second payment, made on April 20, 2017, corresponds to $ 60,950, also equivalent to the amount of notice received on the same date.
These payments follow the administrative processes for verifying the compliance of contributions involving the Parti Québécois team as well as the DGEQ. It is important to remember that since December 2016, the Parti Québécois has made four payments totaling $ 220,845.
The claims in dispute, dating from December 2016, are still awaiting a decision from the Superior Court. As announced previously, the Parti Québécois is fulfilling its commitment to place $ 150,000 in trust in anticipation of a decision that may require additional payments. No date for the follow-up to this dispute has yet been set.
The Parti Québécois reiterates its commitment to reimburse all non-compliant contributions fully identified as such by the DGEQ.
