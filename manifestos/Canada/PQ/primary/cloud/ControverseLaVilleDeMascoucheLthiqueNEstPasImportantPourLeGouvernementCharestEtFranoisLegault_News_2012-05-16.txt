Quebec - The member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for municipal affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, was surprised that François Legault&#39;s CAQ is lining up behind Minister Laurent Lessard in order to protect the mayor of Mascouche and ex-candidate of the Liberal Party of Quebec, Richard Marcotte, despite serious accusations of breach of trust, corruption, fraud and conspiracy to fraud against him.
“The precautionary principle in law does not go against the presumption of innocence. We don&#39;t want to force him to resign, although it would be wise of him to do so on his own. We are asking the government to intervene so that the mayor withdraws from the municipal council, at least temporarily, ”declared Stéphane Bergeron.
The member points out that it is possible to act. Indeed, the Attorney General can bring an action to declare the mayor of Mascouche disqualified. The government could also subject the City of Mascouche to the control of the Commission municipale du Québec.
“Sound management of a municipal administration requires a minimum of trust in elected officials. However, in the current case, the municipal councilors are unanimous and ask for the departure of Mayor Marcotte, ”noted the member for Verchères.
“It is no surprise that the Liberal government is protecting a former Liberal candidate. After all, he&#39;s family. What is surprising is the support of François Legault and the CAQ to protect the mayor of Mascouche. We knew that the Liberal government was unethical; what we are learning today is that the CAQ does not have any either. It&#39;s disturbing, ”concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
