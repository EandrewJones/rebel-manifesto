Quebec - Jean-François Lisée, the member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, youth protection, home care and prevention, denounces the government&#39;s intention to forward with the changes announced to the Individual and Family Assistance Regulation, which provide nothing for beneficiaries accommodated in addiction intervention centers and whose benefits will be cut from 20% to 80% as of the 1st next May.
“Despite the concerns raised by stakeholders in the fight against drug addiction, the government has not listened. There was no impact study by the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Solidarity. Minister Sam Hamad did not measure the very serious consequences that his regulation will have on beneficiaries, on dependency intervention centers threatened with closure, and on the 75 employees who could be laid off, ”said Jean. -François Lisée.
“More than 7,000 of the most vulnerable Quebecers will no longer have access to their treatment; they will therefore likely have to return to the street or to the hospital, where their care costs $ 600 per day. This extreme cut in aid to the most disadvantaged is a real machine for creating homelessness. Again, it is selective austerity that Liberal ministers practice; the Minister for Rehabilitation, Youth Protection and Public Health, Lucie Charlebois, should be embarrassed to be associated with such a cut which will directly affect the clientele that she is responsible for defending ”, said added the member for Rosemont.
