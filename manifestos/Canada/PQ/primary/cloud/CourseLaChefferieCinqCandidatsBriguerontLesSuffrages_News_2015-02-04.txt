Montreal - As the Parti Québécois leadership race officially opens today, the returning officer, Jacques Léonard, confirms that five candidates have filed a ballot in accordance with the rules.
“I am happy to confirm the candidacies of Pierre Céré, Alexandre Cloutier, Bernard Drainville, Martine Ouellet and Pierre Karl Péladeau. The complementarity of their professional background, and of the backgrounds from which they come, clearly reflects the formidable diversity and capacity of attraction of our party. The next few months promise to be very exciting for the members of the Parti Québécois, ”said Jacques Léonard.
A race in which everyone can participate
On the first day of the leadership race, the Parti Québécois is also putting online a website (course.pq.org) dedicated exclusively to the candidate and candidates, as well as to upcoming events organized by the party, and which may answer questions from citizens.
In addition, members who wish to do so can directly question the candidate by writing their questions to the Parti Québécois through Facebook, Twitter (#vosQuestions), YouTube or by writing to course@pq.org.
&quot;I ask Quebeckers to join us, to get involved in this race, to commit their will to act alongside ours and to take their future in hand,&quot; concluded the president of election.
