Québec, June 5, 2020 - The member for René ‑ Lévesque and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of the economy and for SMEs, Martin Ouellet, is asking the government to put in place measures that will allow Québec businesses to promote teleworking, a practice encouraged by Public Health that will help mitigate the consequences of a possible second wave of COVID-19.
IN SHORT
Public Health is clear: where possible, companies are encouraged to allow and facilitate teleworking. “It makes sense: the more you reduce contact between people - in offices, on public transport, etc. -, the better we prevent the spread of the virus. In theory, it sounds simple. But, in practice, companies, and particularly SMEs, need to be supported in this technological shift. Although they did their best this spring, it must be recognized that they do not have the same resources as the public sector, ”declared the MNA for René-Lévesque.
The government of Quebec must support businesses with concrete measures and thus enable them to set up teleworking for more workers for good. Government support can also take several forms. “It is imperative to financially support companies for the purchase of equipment, licenses and technological infrastructure necessary for teleworking. In addition, the government could offer tax incentives to businesses for each day telecommuted by an employee. I offer my full cooperation to the government for the implementation of these measures, which could be detailed in collaboration with representatives of the business community and workers, ”concluded Martin Ouellet.
