Quebec - In response to a question from the Leader of the Official Opposition in the National Assembly, Quebec Premier Pauline Marois recalls that employment is an obsession for her government. On page B.10 of the 2012-2013 Budget Plan, presented by the former Liberal Minister of Finance, Raymond Bachand, we could read that the Liberal government forecast “the creation of 21,300 jobs in 2012” in Quebec.
&quot;Philippe Couillard should be delighted that my government has exceeded the forecasts of the former economic pillar of the Liberal Party, Raymond Bachand, with the creation of 30,800 jobs, or nearly 10,000 more jobs than the PLQ wanted to create,&quot; he added. indicated Pauline Marois.
For 2013, the last Bachand budget provided for the creation of 35,700 jobs. In the first eight months of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, the average level of employment is 62,200 jobs higher. Quebec is once again on the right track to exceed the targets set by the Liberal government for 2013.
