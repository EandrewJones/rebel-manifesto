“This is good news for Produits Belt-Tech and for the entire Granby region,” said MP Serge Cardin. “Over the years, the company has diversified its markets and is now reaping the benefits. Its capacity for innovation and the quality of its production allow it to invest in the future and create around thirty jobs. The company will therefore be able to contribute to regional economic growth and consolidate its position in new international markets. &quot;
