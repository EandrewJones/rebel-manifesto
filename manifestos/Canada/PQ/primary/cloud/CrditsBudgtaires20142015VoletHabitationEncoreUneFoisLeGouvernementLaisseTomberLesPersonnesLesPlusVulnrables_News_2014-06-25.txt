Quebec - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for housing, Carole Poirier, denounces the liberal cuts in the various housing improvement assistance programs that will notably affect people with disabilities and low-income households living in rural areas.
Indeed, the study of the budget appropriations of the Housing component revealed that the budget of the Home Adaptation Program (PAD) for disabled people would be reduced by two-thirds, and that of the RénoVillage program, for renovation assistance. in the region, cut by half.
“It&#39;s very worrying. We are talking about total cuts of $ 28 million, including only $ 19 million for the Home Adaptation Program. The Parti Québécois had acted to reduce waiting times to benefit from this program. The cuts therefore risk extending these deadlines again. How many disabled people will be penalized? Minister Pierre Moreau admitted not having carried out any prior impact study. He therefore has no idea of the direct consequences of these cuts on the lives of people who are waiting for help to adapt their home to their physical condition, ”said Carole Poirier.
Remember that the Parti Québécois government made aid to the most vulnerable a priority. In November 2013, Sylvain Gaudreault, the MP for Jonquière, then Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Minister of Transport and Minister responsible for the Société d&#39;habitation du Québec, announced an amendment to the PAD allowing reduce the processing time for certain requests. The average timeframe thus fell from 45 months in 2006-2007 to 26 months in 2012-2013.
“Once again, the Liberal government is failing the most vulnerable. Its budgetary decisions seriously compromise the improvement of the quality of life of low-income households in rural areas and that of disabled people, thereby serving to support the latter&#39;s quest for autonomy, ”the spokesperson concluded.
