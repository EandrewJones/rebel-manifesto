Quebec - Sylvain Pagé, the member for Labelle and official opposition spokesperson for healthy lifestyles, leisure and sports, deplores the slowness of the Liberal government in the matter of establishing a policy national sports, leisure and physical activity.
“Not only is Minister François Blais postponing the adoption of such a policy until the fall, but he also admits that little money will be available for the action plan. We had accomplished a considerable amount of work to make Quebec one of the fittest nations in the world, with the invaluable collaboration of hundreds of partners from all regions of Quebec; that the outcome of all these efforts is constantly postponed, since the election of the Liberals, it is particularly distressing, ”said Sylvain Pagé.
“The action plan must be ambitious; we must call on all players in Quebec, from the childcare center to the CHSLD. Unfortunately, the government really lacks leadership on this file. Sedentary lifestyle is a growing scourge, and the Liberals should understand that we could save over $ 1.5 billion a year by fighting obesity and promoting healthy lifestyles. We must act now, ”added the MP.
Moreover, like his predecessor, Minister François Blais was unable to explain how the $ 900 million entered in the 2015-2025 QIP will be used. He was also unable to demonstrate that his government had made the slightest representation to make recreational and sports infrastructure eligible for the next Building Canada Fund-Quebec financial assistance program. &quot;Obviously, the minister does not seem to understand the scope of his files and, unfortunately, Quebecers will have to wait a little longer,&quot; concluded Sylvain Pagé.
