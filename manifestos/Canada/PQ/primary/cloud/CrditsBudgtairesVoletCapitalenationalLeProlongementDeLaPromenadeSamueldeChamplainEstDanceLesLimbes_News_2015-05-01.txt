Quebec - The member for Taschereau, House leader of the official opposition and spokesperson for the Capitale-Nationale region, Agnès Maltais, was very surprised to learn that the government has put the brakes on the extension project. Samuel-De Champlain promenade.
“When he was in opposition, the Minister responsible for the Capitale-Nationale region, Sam Hamad, preached the importance of proceeding quickly to phase III; However, he admitted today that not only is the project postponed but, worse, that there is no longer any deadline, despite the Liberal promises on this subject made during the election campaign. Even his colleague, the Liberal MP for Montmorency, Raymond Bernier, took advantage of his speaking time to remind the Minister of the importance of the project, insisting that it was dear to the hearts of the people. Why is the Liberal government ignoring it? », Asked Agnès Maltais.
Regional service agreements with uncertain future
During the study of the appropriations, while questioning Sam Hamad about the effects of the abolition of the CRÉs on the future of specific agreements, the Member for Taschereau herself told the Minister that the agreements for improvement living conditions for the elderly and for the status of women would not be renewed. “It is sad to see that the minister responsible for the Capitale-Nationale only today realizes the impact of his government&#39;s decisions on his ability to act when it comes to regional priorities. It must now be content with pious wishes, and it is the citizens who, once again, are paying the price, ”concluded the Member for Taschereau.
