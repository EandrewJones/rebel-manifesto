Québec, February 28, 2019 - The member for Joliette and spokesperson for the second opposition group in matters of justice, Véronique Hivon, once again obtained the unanimity of the members of the National Assembly, this time for the benefit of the victims sexual assault.
IN SHORT
Véronique Hivon has expressed it many times already: if a crime of a sexual nature has been committed, even if it dates back several decades, its perpetrator must be able to be prosecuted. Victims of this type of assault do not have to be under the pressure of the statute of limitations; they often need time, among other things to find the strength to speak out, and their healing process must be respected.
“Too many victims of sexual crimes have been waiting for this moment for years. They rightly demand justice and reparation. A crime is a crime, an assault remains an assault, regardless of when the acts that caused the harm date back, ”the spokesperson said straight away.
“We are delighted with the unanimous support shown by parliamentarians today for the abolition of the limitation period. Then, given the fact that the CAQ also called for this intervention when it was in opposition, we expect the Minister of Justice, Sonia LeBel, to follow up on this vote quickly and modify the Civil Code so that all victims of a crime of a sexual nature can hope, one day, when they decide to do so, to obtain compensation, ”concluded Véronique Hivon.
