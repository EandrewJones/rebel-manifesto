Quebec - “I&#39;ve never seen that! », Declared at the outset the Member of Parliament for Saint-Maurice and vice-president of the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries, Energy and Natural Resources, Claude Pinard, in relation to the unexpected absence of the administrators. from La Financière agricole du Québec yesterday in committee. “The last time we had to convene by &#39;subpoena&#39; was in the case of Mont Orford and it was a private company. In this case, they are the directors of a Crown corporation. It is very disturbing, ”continued the deputy.
The administrators of La Financière agricole du Québec, who deny the very existence of a serious crisis among producers of pork, beef, lamb and small grains, refuse to come and testify in parliamentary committee despite the fact that they have been summoned three times.
In addition, La Financière is still slow to make available to parliamentarians all the documents required by the committee since June.
“Since 2003, we have the impression that the Liberals have distorted La Financière&#39;s mandate, which is to protect income in order to promote the success and sustainability of Quebec agricultural businesses. In doing so, the Liberals are turning a blind eye to the agricultural crisis and the hundreds of closures of small and medium-sized Quebec farms. It is sad and it is high time for that to change, ”continued the official opposition spokesperson for agriculture and food and Member of Parliament for Kamouraska-Témiscouata, André Simard.
&quot;By denying the existence of the crisis and refusing to appear before a parliamentary committee, La Financière agricole lacks respect towards Quebec farmers and parliamentarians,&quot; lamented André Simard.
“The directors of La Financière will now have no other choice but to come and testify and provide the documents required by the commission. Solutions must be found and implemented quickly for the good of Quebec agriculture, ”concluded the member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata.
