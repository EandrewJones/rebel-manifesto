Quebec - The member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for ethics and integrity, Stéphane Bergeron, confirms that he asked, on Monday, the Ethics and Professional Conduct Commissioner to investigate on the actions of Minister Gaétan Barrette in connection with the appointments to the Center hospitalier de l&#39;Université de Montréal (CHUM).
&quot;I asked the Commissioner to investigate any breaches of the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct for Members of the National Assembly that the Minister of Health and Social Services may have committed by interfering in the appointment process of the department directors of the CHUM, more particularly on his intervention aimed at promoting the appointment of Dr. Patrick Harris as director of the department of surgery. We have reasonable grounds to believe that the Minister has violated section 16 of the Code, which states that:
&quot;In the exercise of his office, a deputy cannot:
(1) act, attempt to act or omit to act in such a way as to promote his personal interests, those of a member of his immediate family or those of one of his non-dependent children or, in an abusive manner, those any other person;
2 ° take advantage of his office to influence or attempt to influence the decision of another person so as to promote his personal interests, those of a member of his immediate family or those of one of his non-dependent children, or , in an abusive manner, those of any other person. &quot;
The crisis that the CHUM is going through is not linked to the return or not of Jacques Turgeon to its head, but to the unacceptable actions of the minister. The latter visibly tried to influence the decision of the Director General and the Board of Directors of the CHUM, even going so far as to exert undue pressure on them, in order to promote the appointment of Dr. Harris as Director of the Department of Surgery. of the establishment. This constitutes a departure from our Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, ”said Stéphane Bergeron.
