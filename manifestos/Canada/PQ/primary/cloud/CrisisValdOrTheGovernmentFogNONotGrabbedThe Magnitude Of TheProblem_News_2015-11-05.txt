Quebec - Following the meeting held yesterday between the Prime Minister and the aboriginal chiefs of the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec and Labrador, the Parti Québécois spokesperson on the status of women and housing , Carole Poirier, and the spokesperson for Indigenous affairs, Guy Leclair, called on the Liberal government to commit to moving forward with an action plan to fight racism and discrimination against aboriginal people by Christmas.
“The Liberal government believes that with a simple investigation by the SPVM and a two-hour meeting with the chiefs, the problem affecting Aboriginal women in Val-d&#39;Or will be resolved. We too went to meet the chefs. We have listened to them and understood that the roots of the problem run much deeper. Racism against Aboriginal people is institutionalized and particularly harmful to women. To solve the problem, we will need an action plan on racism and discrimination, ”said Carole Poirier.
On November 3, the Prime Minister told the National Assembly that “it is true that a plan to fight discrimination must be approved”. The Minister responsible for Indigenous Affairs, Geoffrey Kelley, for his part today refused to engage in the preparation of such a plan. He even refused to say the words &quot;action plan&quot;, although a question on this subject was asked three times.
“Finally, let us remember that the government appointed an observer without consulting the Aboriginals. A nation-to-nation relationship is not that. According to the Prime Minister, to resolve the crisis, all we have to do is point the finger at the federal government, sprinkle a few millions and hold a two-hour meeting. However, the problem is deeper. The Quebec government has a duty to tackle it quickly and more seriously, ”added Guy Leclair.
