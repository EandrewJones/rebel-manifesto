Quebec - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for culture and communications, Martine Ouellet, enthusiastically welcomes the spectacular success of Quebec filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, whose film Arrival - or L&#39;Arrivée, in Quebec - is selected in eight categories, including those of the best realization and the best film, in view of the 89th Oscars ceremony which will be held on February 26th. Unheard of for a Quebec filmmaker!
“Denis Villeneuve becomes the first French-speaking Quebecer to obtain a nomination for best director at the Oscars, a prestigious category still hotly contested. His name is now inscribed alongside that of the greatest directors of our time. His immense talent, already recognized throughout the world, is now receiving fully deserved confirmation, said Martine Ouellet. Like all Quebecers, I will have my fingers crossed on February 26! &quot;
Denis Villeneuve will not be his first steps on the Hollywood red carpet. In 2014, his film Prisoners won a nomination for Best Cinematography, and last year Sicario was nominated for Best Soundtrack, Best Cinematography and Best Sound Editing. Let us also mention the unforgettable Incendies, selected for the Oscars in 2011 in the category best foreign language film. “Quebec creators, and therefore Quebec culture, shine in a strong and lively way all over the planet! The enthusiasm aroused by Denis Villeneuve&#39;s work illustrates this vividly. We must do everything in our power so that Quebec artists can continue to be ambassadors of who we are, here and on all continents. Culture is the soul of a people! », Concluded Martine Ouellet.
