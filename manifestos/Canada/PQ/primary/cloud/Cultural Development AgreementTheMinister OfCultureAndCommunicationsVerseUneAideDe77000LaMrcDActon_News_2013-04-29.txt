Acton - On behalf of the Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, the Member of Parliament for Johnson and Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Yves-François Blanchet, announces the award of a assistance of $ 77,000, over three years, to the regional county municipality (MRC) of Acton, for the implementation of the first cultural development agreement concluded between the MRC and the Ministry of Culture and Communications.
&quot;This first agreement in terms of cultural development will make it possible to showcase the full artistic and heritage potential of the Acton community, while respecting its cultural particularities and its aspirations,&quot; said Minister Kotto.
“This first cultural development agreement is the reflection of a very great local mobilization. The Municipality of Upton, the City of Acton Vale and the MRC d&#39;Acton joined forces and convinced the Desjardins caisses populaires of Saint-Théodore d&#39;Acton, Saint-Nazaire d&#39;Acton, Acton Vale and de la Rivière Noire to invest in the well-being of their community. Because that is what it is ultimately about: improving the quality of life of the population and fostering their sense of belonging, ”said Minister Blanchet.
The agreement aims to achieve five major objectives: promoting, supporting and developing cultural tourism; make the population aware of the heritage and history of the region through projects aimed at knowledge and enhancement of heritage; promote the achievements of artists, organizations and cultural stakeholders in order to make them better known to the population; promote the cultural engagement of the population in order to ensure artistic succession and to anchor the feeling of belonging to the community; and, finally, to preserve and develop cultural organizations and achievements.
The financial assistance provided comes from the Assistance to Partnership Initiatives program of the Ministry of Culture and Communications. It represents 46% of the total amount of the three-year agreement of $ 169,000. The caisses populaires and municipal partners are contributing $ 92,000 for this agreement.
