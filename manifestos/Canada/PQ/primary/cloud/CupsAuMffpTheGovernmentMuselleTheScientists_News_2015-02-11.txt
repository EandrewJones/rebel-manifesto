Quebec - The member for Beauharnois and official opposition critic for wildlife and parks, Guy Leclair, denounces the cutting of a hundred professional positions, including dozens of scientists, at the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks (MFFP).
“The Couillard government is going into Harper mode. The muzzling of scientists is a typical strategy of an authoritarian government. Those of the MFFP are the watchdogs of our fauna and our parks; their retention is essential to sustainable development as well as to the protection of our biodiversity and endangered species, ”said Guy Leclair.
The Member points out that forests, wildlife and parks are a very important economic engine for all of Quebec, particularly for the regions. Once again, therefore, the regions of Quebec are the victims of liberal austerity policies.
“Quebec is preparing to adopt the revised 2015-2020 government sustainable development strategy. Among the 8 major orientations it contains, we find the management of natural resources in a responsible way and respectful of biodiversity. However, the cuts jeopardize the achievement of this objective. The Liberal inconsistency hurts the regions terribly, ”concluded the member for Beauharnois.
