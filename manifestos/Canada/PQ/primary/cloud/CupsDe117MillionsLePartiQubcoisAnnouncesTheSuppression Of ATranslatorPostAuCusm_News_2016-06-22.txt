Quebec– Diane Lamarre, Member of Parliament for Taillon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of health and access to care, and Maka Kotto, Member of Parliament for Bourget and spokesperson responsible for the Charter of the French language, denounce the intention of the McGill University Health Center (MUHC) not to replace a translator, the result of cuts of 242 million made in the health network, including 11.7 million at the MUHC.
&quot;While healthcare teams have been denouncing for several months the unacceptable delays in obtaining a file or a test result in French, the cuts by Minister Barrette are forcing the MUHC to make choices that penalize them even more. , as well as the patients. In April, we learned that the deadlines ranged from 2 to 6 months to have access to documents in French; cases reported to us now report delays of up to 7 months. It is unjustifiable and, in the end, it is the patients who suffer, because the understanding of their state of health can be compromised, ”said Diane Lamarre.
“French is our common language and the official language of Quebec. As Quebeckers prepare to celebrate our national holiday and our culture, we can only be offended to note that not only documents directly related to essential services such as health cannot be obtained in our language. , but, in addition, that liberal austerity worsens the situation, ”added Maka Kotto.
“For patients who are awaiting treatment or care, this translation delay, which is added to all the others, can have significant impacts. Is it normal to have so much trouble getting information in French? Absolutely not! Even in the meetings of the council of doctors, dentists and pharmacists and in the working meetings, it seems that from now on one answers only in English to the questions asked in French. It is absolutely contrary to the spirit of the Charter and completely unacceptable, ”concluded the deputies.
