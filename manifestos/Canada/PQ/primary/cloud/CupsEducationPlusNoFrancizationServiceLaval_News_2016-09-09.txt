Quebec - The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of education, research and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, strongly denounces the fact that certain schools of the Commission scolaire de Laval are being forced to cut an additional $ 1.3 million in 2016-2017, due to the Quebec government&#39;s budgetary rules unveiled this summer.
“While this year, the Laval School Board must deal with 350 new Syrian students, it is obliged to eliminate the 20 positions in its francization service. In fact, she had to choose between sacrificing services for students in difficulty or those intended for children who do not speak a word of French. However, given that students in difficulty have borne the brunt of the last cuts, this year, it is the turn of the francization service; this is insane! When will this government stop attacking direct services to students? Asked the spokesperson.
“Let us remember: Philippe Couillard affirmed that Quebec had the means to receive Syrian refugees well. But, surprise! We learned this morning that even for some children who are starting from zero in French, there are no longer any resources available, ”added the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
“The latest update from the Department of Finance reveals that in the first quarter of 2016, the government spent $ 10 million less on education than the same period last year. How can the Prime Minister and his Minister of Education, Sébastien Proulx, claim that the cuts are over and that the government is reinvesting when there is less money? The Liberals do not care about the population, ”concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
