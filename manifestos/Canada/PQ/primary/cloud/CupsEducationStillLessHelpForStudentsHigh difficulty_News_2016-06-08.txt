Quebec - While the equivalent of 122 professional positions will be abolished in schools during the next school year, these cuts in addition to all the others already announced, the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in education, research and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, deplores the fact that the Minister of Education refused this morning to commit to preventing these new cuts.
“Since the Liberals came to power, hundreds of speech therapists, psychologists, special education technicians and psychoeducators are no longer present in our schools to support and encourage our young people most likely to drop out. The needs are dire and all the government can do is cut more. The government cuts have already done and continue to hurt extremely, and now we learn that the minister is adding a layer! », Explained Alexandre Cloutier.
Indeed, the staffing plans of nearly 60 school boards for next year are unequivocal: not only is the government not correcting the situation, but, even worse, it is working to make it worse. .
“The number of struggling students has increased by 55% in schools over the past 15 years. Despite this, the government continues to cut hundreds of millions in direct services to students. In two years, the Liberals will have withdrawn from our schools more than 372 professionals, yet essential to academic success, their supposed hobbyhorse. Should we remember that after two years of useless debates on educational structures, the government finally committed to taking action for academic success? Why, in this case, does its first act consist in cutting even more in the resources dedicated to students likely to drop out? Even if the Minister says that he will create a few additional positions here and there in certain areas, the needs remain glaring, ”concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
