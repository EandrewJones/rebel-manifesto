Quebec - The MNA for Joliette and official opposition critic for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, calls on the Minister of Culture and Communications, Hélène David, to take action on the cuts without precedent imposed on Radio-Canada.
These cuts will have an even bigger impact than we expected, we learned yesterday. In fact, in several regions of Quebec, the newsletters will be cut by 30 minutes. Once again, because they will lose an important part of the resources allocated to local information, the regions are hit hard.
“Since taking office, Minister Hélène David has taken no concrete action in the CBC, nor in the future of regional news in general. It took a motion unanimously adopted in the National Assembly for it to come out of its silence. What does she intend to do? Has she spoken to her federal counterpart? The motion adopted in the National Assembly is clear: the Minister must initiate a process with the federal government, ”declared Véronique Hivon.
The motion adopted on November 26 underscored the important contribution of Radio-Canada to cultural production, information and entertainment in Quebec. All the parties represented in the National Assembly then expressed concerns about the cuts and confirmed their support for Radio-Canada and its architects.
“The cuts imposed on Radio-Canada will have an impact on the quality of cultural production and on access to information in our regions. This is, moreover, an essential pillar of democracy. The Liberal government and the Minister of Culture and Communications must defend the interests of Quebecers before Ottawa, ”concluded the member for Joliette.
