Quebec - The member for Beauharnois and official opposition critic for wildlife and parks, Guy Leclair, denounces the Liberal government&#39;s budget cuts to the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, which imply the loss of several dozen jobs, particularly in the regions of Quebec.
“Since 2009, the number of wildlife officers has already greatly decreased in Quebec. During the study of the estimates, Minister Laurent Lessard confirmed to me that there was certainly a shortage of staff and that he was going to replace each retirement. Why has he changed his mind? », Asked Guy Leclair.
The member for Beauharnois also recalls that the low number of wildlife officers puts their lives in danger and delays the time of intervention during the intrusion of dangerous animals in an urban environment. It should be noted that the mortality rate for wildlife officers is already the highest among peace officers in Quebec.
“These cuts once again demonstrate the Liberal government&#39;s lack of vision regarding the need to preserve expertise in the Quebec public service. Minister Laurent Lessard is jeopardizing several important projects for the preservation of species, as well as the quality of the environment, ”continued Guy Leclair.
Lack of vision from the Liberal Party
The spokesperson also indicates that these cuts are made before the first conclusion of the work of the Permanent Program Review Commission. “The dozens of jobs lost are a further blow to the employment situation in Quebec, especially in our regions. The Liberals have no plan for economic development and job creation; they only have austerity in mind, ”concluded Guy Leclair.
