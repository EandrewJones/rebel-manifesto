Quebec - Jean-François Lisée, the member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, youth protection, home care and prevention, denounces another austerity measure that will affect direct access to health care and services for patients: this time, the government is attacking institutional pharmacists.
&quot;By cutting the salaries of pharmacists working in health establishments from 15 to 45%, the minister is canceling the efforts that have been made over the past three years to find a solution to the precarious situation of the pharmaceutical workforce in the establishments, increase the range of services and reduce the use of breakdown assistance and overtime, ”said Jean-François Lisée.
The deputy reminds us that establishment pharmacists are scarce; the sector is grappling with the worst shortage of personnel in the health network. By the admission of the Ordre des pharmaciens du Québec, whose mission is to protect the public, the &quot;radical&quot; cuts in the remuneration of pharmacists who work in hospitals will exacerbate this shortage and reduce services to patients.
Jean-François Lisée would also like to point out that establishment pharmacists offer services to both hospitalized patients and those registered in the emergency department or who are followed in an outpatient clinic (diabetes, heart or kidney failure clinics, chemotherapy, etc.). They also perform clinical research, teaching and management tasks.
“The Prime Minister must reverse the completely senseless and counterproductive decision of his minister, because it will only have harmful effects; the costs it will entail for the network will clearly exceed the expected savings, ”he continued.
&quot;Once again, Minister Barrette&#39;s methods are deplorable and will add a brake on access to patient care.&quot; After the enactment of Bill 10, which removes decision-making from the field and the local network, and Bill 20, which, by imposing quotas, will have perverse effects and reduce access to care. , this is a new attack by the Liberal government that will put the network in a very precarious situation, ”concluded Jean-François Lisée.
