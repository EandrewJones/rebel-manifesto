Québec - The member for Labelle and official opposition critic for recreation and sports, Sylvain Pagé, as well as the member for Joliette and critic for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, denounce the cuts of 20% made in the envelope of the national holiday of Quebec.
“Austerity is now affecting our national pride budget. The national holiday is for all Quebecers; it is the moment when we all celebrate our belonging to Quebec. The sums dedicated to it have not been increased for several years; it was important to maintain the increase that our government had adopted. But the Liberals are canceling it, and the impact on the festivities will be significant. They must step back on this cup, ”said Sylvain Pagé.
Let us remember that the federal government, for its part, did not hesitate to inject large sums to commemorate the War of 1812, and that it will not hesitate to do so to mark Canada&#39;s 150th anniversary in 2017.
“The festivities of June 24 are above all a very large number of neighborhood celebrations; we celebrate locally. These are meeting opportunities for all citizens. The importance of the national holiday for our cultural identity, and for making it known, is indisputable. Shows or artists risk being sacrificed, moreover. In short, it is essential to maintain the national holiday budget, ”added Véronique Hivon.
