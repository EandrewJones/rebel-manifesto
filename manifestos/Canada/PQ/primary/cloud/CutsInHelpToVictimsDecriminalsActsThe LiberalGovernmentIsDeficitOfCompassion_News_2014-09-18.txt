Québec - Jean-François Lisée, the member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, youth protection, home care and prevention, and the member for Lac-Saint-Jean and justice critic, Alexandre Cloutier, deplore the fact that the Liberal government persists in proposing measures that will severely affect our families and the most vulnerable. Now he is attacking victims of crime.
Following an article reporting planned cuts in compensation for victims of crime, Jean-Francois Lisée questioned the Minister of Justice, Stéphanie Vallée, as well as the Prime Minister. They have confirmed that the compensation program will be cut.
&quot;How can we consider cutting aid to people who have been victims of a crime? This government clearly shows a great deficit of compassion. After having canceled 15,000 places in childcare services, cut in homework assistance and food aid, and called into question the parental insurance plan, today, he wants to cut support for men and women. women who have experienced severe trauma or bereavement. The Minister of Justice refused to close the door to reducing the amounts set aside for victims of crime. The Prime Minister must make an unequivocal commitment that these people are not, in addition, victims of his cuts, ”said Jean-Francois Lisée.
Alexandre Cloutier is surprised at the questioning of this program. “In May 2013, the Parti Québécois government unanimously passed Bill 22, which improved the compensation plan. We have heard the poignant testimonies of Isabelle Gaston, Michel Surprenant and several other victims who asked for this improvement. Why question it today? It is an unacceptable lack of compassion on the part of the Liberal government, ”he concluded.
