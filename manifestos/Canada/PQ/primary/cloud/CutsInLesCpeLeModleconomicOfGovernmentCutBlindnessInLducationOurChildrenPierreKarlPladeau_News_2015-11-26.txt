Quebec - The leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, denounces the cuts made to the network of childcare services in Quebec.
“The Liberal government has no limit in the damage it is prepared to do to achieve its austerity agenda. The early childhood center program has made Quebec a paradise for families. It works with young children to increase integration and academic success, and it has enabled thousands of women to enter the labor market. This is the equal opportunities program. However, the Liberal government is working to weaken it. He has done everything in the past year to promote non-subsidized private daycare centers. And now he wants to cut $ 120 million by bringing a race to the bottom across the subsidized child care system. The government&#39;s economic model is to cut blindly in the education of our children, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“The cuts announced by the government are the equivalent of 2,800 positions for educators who work with our children every day. This is 12% of all educators who work in our early childhood centers, positions occupied mainly by women. It is a real attack on family policy. However, in response, the Prime Minister preferred to continue talking about everything, except cuts in childcare services, ”he added.
Let us recall that the Prime Minister said during his opening speech: &quot;We will continue to develop childcare services by protecting middle-class or low-income families from a tariff shock. &quot;
“The Liberal government and its Prime Minister continue to target childcare centers, even though they were elected by promising the opposite during the 2014 election campaign. They did not say one. only word. According to the Prime Minister&#39;s commitment in his opening speech, they should instead be limited to indexing tariffs. The Prime Minister must give up cutting these additional $ 120 million from the childcare network, ”concluded the leader of the official opposition.
