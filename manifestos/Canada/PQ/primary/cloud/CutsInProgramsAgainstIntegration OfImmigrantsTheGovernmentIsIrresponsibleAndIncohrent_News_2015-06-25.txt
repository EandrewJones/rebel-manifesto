Quebec - The member for Bourget and official opposition critic for immigration and responsible for the Charter of the French language, Maka Kotto, deplores the fact that the Couillard government is quietly making cuts to two programs put in place. place to help newcomers familiarize themselves with Quebec.
In fact, Quebec has announced a 25% reduction in the number of sessions offered to immigrants. “Last week, we were told about increasing the immigration thresholds and, this week, we want to cut integration courses. However, specialists and stakeholders in the field have warned the government about the inadequacy of the current services dedicated to the integration of immigrants. In this regard, too, liberal austerity is hitting several organizations dedicated to better integration of newcomers, ”said Maka Kotto.
Minister Kathleen Weil justified these cuts by citing a drop in demand. “At the moment, these courses are not compulsory. Rather than reducing them, the government should, on the contrary, make an effort to promote them; this would enable a greater number of newcomers to benefit from it and would therefore ensure better social, cultural and professional integration, ”continued the Member for Bourget.
“Getting to know Quebec and its culture better is an essential key to the successful integration of newcomers. The government must get its act together, act responsibly and stop raising immigration thresholds; rather, it should think about concrete actions that would ensure that we are able to welcome the 50,000 immigrants who already arrive in Quebec annually, ”concluded Maka Kotto.
