Quebec– Parti Québécois spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, sees more and more every day how the Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Lise Thériault, embodies &quot;feminism in her own way&quot;: today , she refused to commit to restoring funding to the 16 Quebec organizations specializing in the development of the female workforce, thus further weakening support for the employability of women.
In the last budget, the government cut funding for these organizations by 60%, from $ 1.2 million to $ 500,000. “At the time, the Minister of Justice promised to create a committee that would work quickly to support the groups&#39; overall mission. A year later, the verdict is final: no funding is available. It is essential to restore the envelope of 1.2 million in the next budget. Minister Thériault must act immediately to help women integrate or re-enter the labor market, ”said Carole Poirier.
The MP recalls that over the past 30 years, these 16 organizations, which work in 11 regions of Quebec, have changed lives by developing a coherent approach as well as major and specialized expertise to help women in the market. work. In 2014, an evaluation by the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Solidarity confirmed the very positive results of the work of these groups with women:
“The advancement of women requires concrete action and not wishful thinking. The austerity imposed by this government weakens the regional expertise that supports Quebec women. How can Lise Thériault come before the members of the March 8 Collective and promise them that she will fight for equality between men and women? How can she table a motion to mark International Women&#39;s Rights Day when, by her actions, she is pushing them back? », Carole Poirier concluded.
