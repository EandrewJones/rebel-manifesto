Quebec, April 13, 2017 - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois for Bill 128, An Act to promote the protection of individuals by setting up a framework for dogs, André Villeneuve, welcomes the fact that the government has finally decided to end the status quo on dangerous dogs. However, he asks for clarification.
IN SHORT
“Considering all the unfortunate events involving dangerous dogs that have taken place in Quebec, we welcome the implementation of clear rules. It is inconceivable that in Quebec today, dogs can kill or disfigure people. Our duty is to ensure that this never happens again. This bill is a step in the right direction so that people can be safe everywhere, ”said the MP.
The Parti Québécois is, however, wondering about certain aspects of the bill. &quot;Why does the government want to ban by decree, on day 1 of the passage of the bill, only dogs of the pitbull type?&quot; There are other dogs that are also very dangerous, but there are no plans to ban them by decree. In addition, the government is expected to unveil the process it intends to put forward to determine whether a dog is a pit bull or not. Is a quarter-mixed dog a pit bull? How does the government plan to determine that, where are we going to draw the line? “, Asked André Villeneuve in particular.
