Quebec - The most recent employment data, published this morning by Statistics Canada, show a positive result in Quebec in 2013 compared to 2012.
“The data for December provide the overall picture for the year just ended. We can therefore see that an average of 47,800 jobs were created in 2013, a level slightly higher than our forecasts. This is good news since 2013 was a better year than 2012 in terms of job creation, when 30,800 jobs were created. Let us recall that the last budget of the Liberal government provided for the creation of 35,700 jobs for 2013 when in reality, 12,100 more jobs were created than the former Minister Raymond Bachand predicted ”, indicated the Minister of Finance. and from Economics, Mr. Nicolas Marceau.
“Let us note that the level of employment thus reached an annual peak never reached historically with 4,032,200 people at work for the year. The annual unemployment rate, for its part, fell 0.2 percentage points to 7.6%. In addition, the annual employment rate (60.3%) in Quebec is at its highest level since 2008. Also, the employment rate of people aged 15 to 64 (72.2%) reached a new annual summit unmatched since 1976 ”, underlined the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Ms. Agnès Maltais.
We can see the confidence of the Quebec population in having a job since the active population increased by 12,100 people in December 2013, despite a difficult economic situation at the Canadian level. As for the unemployment rate, it was 7.7%, an increase of 0.5 percentage point mainly due to the increase in the labor force.
