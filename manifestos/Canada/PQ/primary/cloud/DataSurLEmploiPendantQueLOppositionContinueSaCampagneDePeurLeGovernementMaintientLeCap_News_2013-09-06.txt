Quebec - “While the opposition parties continue to try to scare Quebecers, the facts are stubborn: never under a Liberal government have there been as many Quebecers in the labor market as today. This is what the Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau, declared.
Employment data released today by Statistics Canada shows that the monthly unemployment rate fell 0.3 percentage points to 7.9% in August. Moreover, employment in Quebec was little changed (down 5,000 jobs in August compared to the previous month). 21,200 new full-time jobs were created in Quebec in August. Also, during the first eight months of 2013, employment is up by 62,200 jobs compared to the same period in 2012. Since the start of the year, employment growth in Quebec (1.6 %) is similar to that of the United States and is higher than that of Ontario (1.5%) and Canada (1.4%).
GDP by industry for the first five months of 2013 is 1.4% higher than the same period of the previous year. Retail sales (+ 0.4%), wages and salaries (+ 0.6%) and exports (+ 5.4%) advanced in the second quarter of 2013. In addition, the most recent economic indicators, in particular international merchandise exports (+ 6.4% in June) and housing starts (+ 1.1% in July), continue to advance.
Despite global uncertainties, Quebec&#39;s economy continued to grow in 2013. It will benefit from the acceleration in the recovery of the US economy and the significant investments announced or underway in Quebec.
“As expected, private investment is there. The investments of $ 40 million by Danone in Boucherville and $ 16.3 million by Servier Canada in Laval announced today are tangible proof of this, ”said the Minister.
“Since taking office we have been able to do what the Liberals have never done in nine years: we control government spending. With preliminary results of 1.7% growth in 2012-2013 and a forecast of 1.9% for this year, Quebec is in good shape for the future. The current situation allows the government to stay on course for a balanced budget while stimulating job creation, ”Nicolas Marceau concluded. The Minister will follow up on the situation in his fall economic and financial update.
