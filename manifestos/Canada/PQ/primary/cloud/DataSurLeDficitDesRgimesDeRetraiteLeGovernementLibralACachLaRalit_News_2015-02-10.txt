Quebec - The member for Sanguinet and official opposition critic for pensions, Alain Therrien, reacted to the publication of figures concerning the deficit of municipal employees&#39; pension plans, which reveal that the government has overestimated the scale of the deficit to impose his bill on workers and retirees in Quebec.
“Manipulating the numbers to achieve their ends has been the way the Liberals have been doing since they came to power. At that time, the government inflated Quebec&#39;s deficit figures to justify its austerity policy; the Minister of Health admitted that he encouraged medical specialists to falsify the results of polls; today, we learn that Minister Pierre Moreau has inflated the figures on the deficit of municipal employee pension plans, ”declared Alain Therrien.
The member recalled that he had tabled, on September 18, a motion asking for updated figures for pension plans. The Liberal government and the CAQ voted against it. “We wanted to have the right picture to apply the right remedy. The minister, for his part, made sure that the real numbers were not released before the bill was passed. Speakers and experts heard in parliamentary committee said the situation was improving. The minister hid the reality; he twisted the democratic process in order to apply his solution, without taking into account the reality of workers and retirees, ”concluded Alain Therrien.
