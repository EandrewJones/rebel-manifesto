Quebec - The member for Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, took part today in the youth march organized by the carrefours jeunesse-emploi (CJE) in the Outaouais region, to denounce the liberal reform of the CJEs and their mission.
“For weeks, the mobilization of young people, CJEs and their workers has not faltered. The reform of Minister François Blais does not pass. Given the current economic situation in Quebec, we cannot ignore 40,000 young people by sending them elsewhere. They are engaged in a process of reintegration into employment thanks to the services provided by the CJEs. Their mission must therefore absolutely be preserved, ”said Dave Turcotte.
The member welcomed the mobilization of the four ECJs in the region (Pontiac, Papineau, Vallée-de-la-Gatineau and Outaouais); Hundreds of people marched today to raise awareness in the region&#39;s Liberal MPs about the importance of the ECJ&#39;s mission. In addition, 1142 letters of support were given to Chapleau MP Marc Carrière. Dave Turcotte particularly highlights the commitment of the ECJ pioneer, that of the Outaouais, founded by the Parti Québécois government, and its general director, Martine Morissette.
“As we speak, there is no guarantee that the resources and mission of the CJE will be maintained. It would have been so much easier to ask them to pay particular attention to young people who are the furthest from the labor market, while ensuring them support for their entire mission. It is a debate of structures, initiated and pursued by the government, which does not take into account the particularities of the mission of the CJEs, nor the place where they are located. We will continue to fight so that no young people are left behind and so that the CJEs are supported in their work. The government must back down, ”concluded Dave Turcotte.
