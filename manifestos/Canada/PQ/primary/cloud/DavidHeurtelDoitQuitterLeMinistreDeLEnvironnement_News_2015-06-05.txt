In fact, during the question period, David Heurtel admitted that when he had granted a certificate of authorization to TransCanada to carry out drilling off Cacouna, he did not have all the necessary information, in particular as regards the status. precarious beluga. “So not only did the minister not act under the precautionary principle, but he also violated his ministerial responsibility; the Prime Minister must absolutely remove him from office, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
“The investigation report is clear and serious. On many occasions, the minister should have acted and protected the beluga nursery, an endangered species. He did nothing, while the file was on his desk. The worst part is that he blamed his officials for the poor management of the TransCanada file! », Recalled the spokesperson.
