Following a wastewater spill in the Yamaska River, the deputy for Terrebonne and the Parti Québécois environmental spokesperson, Mathieu Traversy, asks Minister David Heurtel to change the way his ministry operates and to take into account three proposals made by the Parti Québécois for months.
“Since the flushgate, David Heurtel has not changed his wastewater management. Through access to information requests, we demonstrated that 92 notices of non-compliance were given to 69 municipalities, between November 2015 and March 2016, for a fine of barely $ 1,000. Only 52% of inspections scheduled in the program? Verification of Spill Notice? were carried out in 2014-2015. In Quebec, no report lists the overflows that occur in municipalities, ”said Mathieu Traversy.
The Parti Québécois is proposing three concrete actions to be implemented quickly:
1) More inspections and the application of more systematic and severe penalties to offending municipalities;
2) Make public an evolving dashboard on discharges from overflow structures in Quebec: nature and volumes of wastewater discharged, monitoring of the corrective measures prescribed to municipalities. To achieve this, return to centralizing the collection, validation and publication of data on the monitoring of wastewater treatment works by the Ministry of the Environment, rather than transferring these responsibilities to the municipalities;
3) Creation of a public register specific to authorization requests made by municipalities for wastewater discharges.
“We must also support municipalities so that they can improve and regularize their wastewater management structures. Funding for infrastructure must be increased and facilitated. Regarding the spill in Saint-Hyacinthe, the Minister must make all documents public on the ministry&#39;s website; we must know in all transparency what happened, ”concluded Mathieu Traversy.
