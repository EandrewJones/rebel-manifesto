Quebec - On the occasion of the Memorial Day for those killed or injured at work, the member for Sanguinet and official opposition spokesperson for labor, Alain Therrien, recalled that the health and safety of workers must remain priorities for our society and that in these areas, prevention is the key to success.
“On this day in memory of the women and men who lost their lives at work, I have a very special thought for their families and loved ones, and I express the hope that all the actions required to make our workplaces more secure. Year after year, too many lives are shattered by a workplace accident. Moreover, beyond the consequences on the people themselves, their families and their colleagues, each work accident means a considerable loss of expertise for the company concerned as well as significant social costs. Quebec does not have the means to deprive itself of so much talent, so many resources; he needs all his workers, ”said Alain Therrien.
However, according to the member, it is through prevention that we can hope to see a decrease in the number of accidents. “In the best interest of workers and employers, Quebec must continue to support efforts devoted to strengthening a culture of prevention. As much as possible, we must act to eliminate hazards in the workplace and thereby prevent injury and death. The safety of workers must become a value of society, for which both employers and workers must commit, ”continued the spokesperson.
It should be remembered that it was under a Parti Québécois government that for the first time, the flag of the National Assembly was half-masted in memory of workers who died in the performance of their duties. &quot;This important gesture reminds us that it is unacceptable to risk your life trying to win it&quot;, concluded Alain Therrien.
