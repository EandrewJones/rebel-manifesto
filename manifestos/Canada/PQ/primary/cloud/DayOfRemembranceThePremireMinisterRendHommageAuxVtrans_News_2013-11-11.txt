“We must pay tribute to these women and men who left family and friends to go to the battlefields. They have made many sacrifices to defend ideals that are dear to us, such as democracy, freedom and peace. Let us take advantage of this day of commemoration to underline their courageous contribution, to think of the people who are still at the front today and to honor the memory of those who lost their lives there, ”declared the Premier of Quebec.
To salute the bravery of all those who have taken part in an armed conflict throughout our history, the Prime Minister laid a wreath of flowers at the Cross of Sacrifice and observed a moment of meditation.
