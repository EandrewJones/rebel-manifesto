Quebec - “The meteoric rise in the price of gasoline in recent weeks has a major impact on the budgets of Quebec families. Beyond words, we need action. The Liberal government of Jean Charest must explore all means to limit the impact of this increase now ”. This is what the member for La Prairie and official opposition spokesperson for consumer protection, François Rebello, asked the National Assembly.
Mr. Rebello pointed out that it will cost $ 1,000 more this year for each Quebec family at a price of $ 1.42 / liter. However, in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, the price per liter is 10 cents and 12 cents less. This is mainly due to the fact that these governments have set a maximum price.
Despite the openness shown by Minister Nathalie Normandeau, MP Rebello is asking the government to go into action mode. “Minister Normandeau is in a hurry to act when it comes to shale gas, but is hurrying too slowly for motorists who are caught by the throat. We in the Parti Québécois are ready to sit down with the government to study the proposal made by the Union des consommateurs and the Quebec Association of Petroleum Independents for the benefit of motorists, ”continued Mr. Rebello.
&quot;Until Quebec frees itself from its dependence on oil and the electrification of transport is forcefully deployed throughout the territory, the government has the obligation to take all means to ensure that Quebec families are not not victims of a higher price per liter of gasoline here than elsewhere, ”he concluded.
