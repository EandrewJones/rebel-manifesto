Quebec - The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, is satisfied with the decision of the Court of Appeal of Quebec, which declares unconstitutional Bill C-7 proposed by the federal government to modify the Senate.
“I am delighted with the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal. This Court affirms very clearly that Ottawa cannot act alone to reform the Senate, such a reform being able to be done only within the framework of a multilateral negotiation ”, declared the Minister Bertrand St-Arnaud.
In its decision, the Court of Appeal specifies that “the federal bill, if it had been adopted, would have been unconstitutional […] since it constituted, by its very nature, a modification of the mode of selection of senators and of the powers of the Senate, without respecting the planned process, but instead attempting to circumvent it ”.
&quot;Armed with this unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal, we will continue to oppose federal unilateralism in the context of the reference on Senate reform addressed by the federal government to the Supreme Court,&quot; concluded Minister Bertrand St -Arnaud.
In fact, on the sidelines of this opinion requested from the Quebec Court of Appeal, the federal government submitted its Senate reform project to the Supreme Court as part of a referral procedure. The hearing before the Supreme Court will take place on November 12, 13 and 14.
