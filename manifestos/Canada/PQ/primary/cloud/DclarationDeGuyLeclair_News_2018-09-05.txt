This evening I made the decision to withdraw my candidacy for the October 1 elections. I do so with regret, because being the Member of Parliament for Beauharnois for 10 years was the most beautiful professional challenge that life has granted me.
I am confident that justice will clear me of the accusation against me today and I am grateful to my leader for having defended my right as a citizen to the presumption of innocence. However, I believe that the election of the Parti Québécois is too important for my personal case to distract from our generous and pragmatic proposals, from our fight for independence, from our team which, I know, will know so well. serve Quebeckers.
In the coming days, I will be helping to choose a new candidate who will be able to continue the work of defending the citizens of Beauharnois, whom I salute and thank from the bottom of my heart.
