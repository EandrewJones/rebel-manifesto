Quebec, February 28, 2017 - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for public security, Pascal Bérubé, responds to information obtained by La Presse indicating a letter sent to the SPVM in February 2014.
“While Stéphane Bergeron was Minister of Public Security, proceedings were underway before the courts. The minister was not to intervene under any circumstances. We learned from the media today that a letter had been sent to the director of the SPVM at the time, Marc Parent; the Deputy Minister of Public Security was placed in a carbon copy. The Minister was never informed of the existence of this letter. Now, once in place, was the new Minister of Public Security informed? We don&#39;t know, ”said Pascal Bérubé.
