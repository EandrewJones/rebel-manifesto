Quebec - The member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, reacted to the results of the referendum held in Scotland.
“After a positive campaign that lasted for several months, it was in peace and with the greatest respect for democracy that the people of Scotland were able to discuss their future and vote.
This desire to give itself a country mobilized all of Scotland.
With pride, the Scots turned out to vote in large numbers.
From all backgrounds, all ages, all origins, more than 84% of them exercised their civic duty and took a stand by voting.
The result of this referendum shows how powerful the Scottish independence movement is. Because the process was flawless and attracted everyone&#39;s participation, the whole of Scotland came out of it.
All have accepted the rules of democracy, in particular that of the absolute majority, of 50% + 1.
The result allows this nation to look to its future with strength. The British government, which was respectful of the process leading to the referendum vote, has also announced that it will step up its dialogue with the Scottish nation.
Well done to the Scots for their inspiring approach!
Our two nations have a lot to say to each other and so much to learn from each other. We will continue to strengthen our ties with Scotland, if not intensify them. &quot;
