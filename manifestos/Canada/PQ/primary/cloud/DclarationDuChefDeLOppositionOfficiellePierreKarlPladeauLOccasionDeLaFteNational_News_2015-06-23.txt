Quebec - The member for Saint-Jérôme and leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, wished all Quebecers great celebrations on the occasion of the national holiday.
“June 24 is the feast of all Quebecers. Across our territory, in all our regions, there will be hundreds of thousands of us participating in the many activities organized. Together, with family, friends, in the neighborhood, we will celebrate our pride in belonging to this great French-speaking people of America.
Let us also take a moment to reflect on the deep significance of this very special day. Let us remember the struggles, values, ideals and achievements that have made us the warm and open nation that we are. And we can become even more; it&#39;s up to us to make history again. The future is ours.
More and more, throughout the world, the voice of Quebeckers is being heard, innovative, creative, unique. It tells about our culture, our daring, our successes. It does so without imposing any limits, in a harmonious and generous way, in our image. Let&#39;s be proud of it!
On behalf of the entire Parti Québécois team, I wish you very pleasant celebrations on the occasion of our national holiday. &quot;
