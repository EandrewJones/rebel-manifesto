Because the situation in which Catalonia finds itself, especially since October 2017, is of great concern to us and particularly:
Faced with the imprisonment and conviction of Jordi Sànchez and Jordi Cuixart, respectively presidents of the Catalan Assembly and mnium cultural, two large organizations of Catalan civil society;
Oriol Junqueras, Dolors Bassa, Raül Romeva, Jordi Turull, Carme Forcadell, Joaquim Forn and Josep Rull;
Faced with the disqualification sentences and the fines imposed on democratically elected members of the Catalan government, Meritxell Borràs, Carles Mundó and Santi Vila;
In view of the arrest warrants issued against elected members of the government, currently in exile, including the president and current MEP Carles Puigdemont, ministers Clara Ponsatí, Lluís Puig and Antoni Comín;
In the face of exile also imposed on elected members of the Catalan parliament Meritxell Serret, Marta Rovira and Anna Gabriel;
Faced with the repression and recourse to violence by the Spanish government against the Catalan people, the judicialization of politics and the criminalization of the right to demonstrate;
Faced with the violation of the civil and political rights of the Catalan people and their parliament;
Faced with the Spanish government&#39;s refusal to sit down and negotiate a peaceful end to the crisis;
Faced with the stagnation of the international community:
We, members of the Quebec Coalition for Solidarity with Catalonia, express loud and clear our support for the Catalan people who are fighting peacefully and democratically for their right to self-determination;
We denounce the irregularities in the trials and the repeated interference of the political powers in the Spanish judicial process;
We strongly condemn the disproportionate sentences and penalties for sedition, embezzlement and disobedience inflicted on men and women who have only exercised their fundamental rights;
We urge the international community, in the wake of the denunciations made, among others, by Amnesty International, to condemn the imprisonments of Catalan leaders, as well as the arrest warrants issued against people in exile;
We call on the Spanish government to amnesty the Catalan leaders, to free those who are imprisoned and to cancel the arrest warrants issued against Carles Puigdemont and the other members of his government in exile. .
We also call on the entire international community, in particular the Spanish government, to recognize and respect the right to democracy, the right to decide and the right to self-determination of the Catalan people.
We call on the governments of Quebec and Canada to condemn imprisonment and clearly recognize these rights, in particular the right to self-determination.
Because like Quebec and so many other nations around the world, the people of Catalonia have the right to democratically decide their political future.
Because peoples have the right to be free!
