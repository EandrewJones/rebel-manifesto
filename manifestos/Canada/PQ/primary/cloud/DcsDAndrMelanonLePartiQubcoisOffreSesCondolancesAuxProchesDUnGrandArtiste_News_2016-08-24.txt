Quebec– The Member of Parliament for Jonquière and Leader of the Official Opposition, Sylvain Gaudreault, paid tribute to the filmmaker, actor and director André Melançon, whose works were greatly appreciated by Quebeckers from several generations.
“It is with great sadness that this morning we received the news of the death of André Melançon. First of all, on behalf of the members of the parliamentary wing of the Parti Québécois, I would like to offer my most sincere condolences to the members of her family, in particular to her partner, Mrs. Andrée Lachapelle, and to her children, as well as to his friends and collaborators. I wish them a lot of serenity in the event, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault first.
“We owe André Melançon key works of Quebec film culture, films and shows that have marked minds and will remain classics. His talent and instinct made him a respected mentor, among others by members of the great family of the National Improvisation League. He undoubtedly mastered the art of telling a story in a way that directly touched the hearts of people of all ages. In his way of approaching and seeing the world, there was that touch of the marvelous, of spontaneity that characterized him and that made him famous, ”then indicated Mr. Gaudreault.
&quot;I am pleased that Quebec has had the opportunity to honor André Melançon during his lifetime, by appointing him, in particular, an officer of the Ordre national du Québec, in 2013. This tribute, fully deserved, is worth of a man who will remain a source of inspiration for his peers and for the next generation, and who leaves behind a considerable cultural heritage, ”the official opposition leader concluded.
