Quebec - In reaction to the death of Bernard Chaudron, the Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, expressed his sadness at the disappearance of a man who has contributed with talent to Quebec culture and to the recognition of the professions of &#39;art.
&quot;On behalf of Quebeckers, I would like to pay tribute to a daring and inventive craftsman, who nurtured a passion for the metallurgical arts that has never left him during a long and prolific career,&quot; declared the minister.
Bernard Chaudron left his native France at a young age to settle in Quebec in 1951 and, a few years later, to embark on jewelry and the manufacture of precious objects from metals and minerals. During the 1970s, he turned to art tinning. His work is world famous today. Bernard Chaudron has also greatly contributed to the recognition of fine crafts, in particular through his involvement in the Salon des métiers d&#39;art where he still exhibited in 2012 and the Conseil des métiers d&#39;art du Québec.
“Bernard Chaudron was one of those who, from elsewhere, enriched Quebec culture at a time when it was taking off. It was a fair and enlightened decision by the government to underline this year the importance of its contribution by awarding it, last January, the Medal of the National Assembly, a high distinction awarded to the great figures of our nation ”, concluded Minister Kotto.
The Minister wished to offer his most sincere condolences to the relatives of a man of heart and culture who took care to perpetuate his discipline by keeping his techniques and his workshop in the family.
