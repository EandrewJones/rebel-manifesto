“It is with great sadness that the members of the parliamentary wing of the Parti Québécois learned of the death of Claude Léveillée. Its disappearance will create a huge void in Quebec culture. Indeed, this morning, Quebec lost one of its most illustrious singer-songwriters. Claude Léveillée was a giant, ”commented the leader of the official opposition, Pauline Marois.
“At a time when Quebec did not yet have a music industry, he was one of the pioneers in building an authentically Quebec popular scene. From the bohemian songboxes to the top of Mount Royal during the legendary show Once Five, including of course the major Parisian stages, Claude Léveillée shone everywhere in a brilliant way, ”she added.
“A grandiose life, an ocean crossed when it was still so much the exception, the greatest talents even in troubled intimacy, but above all a window wide open on sometimes hard, sometimes tender pieces of our collective soul, l &#39;Claude Léveillée&#39;s legacy has the depth of our sadness and our gratitude, ”added Yves-François Blanchet, the member for Drummond and the Parti Québécois spokesperson for culture.
