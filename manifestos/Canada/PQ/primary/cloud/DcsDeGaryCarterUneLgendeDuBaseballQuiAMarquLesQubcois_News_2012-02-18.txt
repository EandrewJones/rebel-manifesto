Quebec - Following yesterday&#39;s announcement of the death of Gary Carter, the Parti Québécois wishes to offer its condolences to his family and loved ones.
“Gary Carter was an idol for many Quebecers and a model during his 11 seasons with the Montreal Expos. It&#39;s a loss for the world of baseball, but also for all Montrealers and Quebeckers who have been fans of the Expos, ”declared the member for Labelle and official opposition spokesperson for recreation and sports, Sylvain Pagé.
He was a great ambassador for Montreal and an example of generosity during his time in Quebec. “Quebec sports fans are in mourning today. They lose the one who was probably the greatest star in Expos history. He was also the first to be inducted into the Cooperstown Baseball Hall of Fame wearing the Expos cap in 2003. This induction is one of the last traces of Expos history that will live on forever. In this sense, the members and deputies of the Parti Québécois recognize Mr. Carter&#39;s contribution to the Quebec sports world. He gave us some wonderful moments during his career in Montreal, ”concluded Sylvain Pagé.
