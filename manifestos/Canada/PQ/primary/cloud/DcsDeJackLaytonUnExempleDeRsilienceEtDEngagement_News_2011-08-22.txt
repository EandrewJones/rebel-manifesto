Montreal - On behalf of the parliamentary wing of the Parti Québécois, the Leader of the Official Opposition and Member of Parliament for Charlevoix, Pauline Marois, wishes to express her sadness at the death of Mr. Jack Layton.
“This morning, it was a shock for me to learn of the departure of a man so sympathetic, so passionate about political action. He had retired for some time in the hope of returning to do his job as leader of the official opposition in Ottawa, ”commented Pauline Marois.
“Public life is demanding. Until the end, we will have seen combative Jack Layton, still accompanied by his wife Olivia Chow. Together, they have provided all who make politics a shining example of resilience and commitment. Likewise, Mr. Layton&#39;s smile and determination represent a message of hope to all those fighting cancer and to their loved ones, ”added the Leader of the Official Opposition.
“Beyond the political differences, we must recognize that Mr. Layton had succeeded in touching the hearts of the citizens of Quebec. He had succeeded in rebuilding in a beautiful way a political party which was going through great difficulties when he took over its leadership. I find it very sad to see that he could not benefit from his victory in the last election. In his life, through his work, he has put forward a way of doing politics that is positive, inspiring, close to people. Beyond his fight against the disease, this is what history will remember about him, ”admitted Pauline Marois.
&quot;On behalf of my parliamentary team, I would like to express my most sincere condolences to his wife Olivia Chow, his children, his relatives and friends, and to all the elected officials and collaborators of the New Democratic Party,&quot; concluded the leader of the Parti Québécois. .
