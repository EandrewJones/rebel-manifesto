Quebec - Charlevoix Leader of the Official Opposition and MP Pauline Marois, and Bourget MP and Culture and Communications Spokeswoman Maka Kotto offer their sincere condolences to the family, loved ones, friends as well as all Quebecers who knew and enjoyed Jean-Guy Moreau.
“I am deeply saddened by the disappearance of this great from the Quebec cultural scene. I remember his beginnings in the company of Robert Charlebois in the network of song boxes that he recently revived in 2009 with Pierre Calvé, Pierre Létourneau, Claude Gauthier and Robert Charlebois. I also remember his inimitable comedy shows including the famous Le chum à Céline and Jean-Guy Moreau like no one. Entire generations have laughed thanks to Mr. Moreau. We are all a little orphan today, ”said Pauline Marois.
“With the death of Jean-Guy Moreau, Quebec loses one of its great artists who, over the course of his long career, has been able to put intelligence and finesse at the service of humor. He will have collaborated with the biggest names in the scene and in Quebec humor, such as Guy Latraverse, Dominique Michel, Louise Latraverse, Yvon Deschamps or even Clémence Desrochers. And who does not remember his imitations of Jean Drapeau, Gilles Vigneault, René Lévesque or Yves Montand? He will have shown the way to the happy cohort of comedians and imitators who are now thronging all stages of Quebec, ”added Maka Kotto.
