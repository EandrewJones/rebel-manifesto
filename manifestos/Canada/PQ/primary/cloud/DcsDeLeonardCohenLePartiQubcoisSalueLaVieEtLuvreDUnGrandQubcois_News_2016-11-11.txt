Quebec City, November 11, 2016 - The news of the death of singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, one of the most influential of his generation, deeply moved Quebecers. Jean-François Lisée, leader of the official opposition, and his colleague Martine Ouellet, spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of culture and communications, wanted to salute the great Quebecer he was.
“In my eyes, Leonard Cohen is the quintessential poet-lyricist. He knew how to describe the human soul, love, grief, remorse, with a command of the language where empathy and derision were combined. His more political texts, including Democracy is coming to the USA, strongly reflected the extent of the American malaise, ”Jean-François Lisée first reacted.
“His love affair with Montreal and Quebec has always been part of him. Among other things, his happiness at singing La Manic, by Georges Dor. A national funeral - a first for an Anglo-Quebecer -, if the family consents, or a national ceremony should allow him to accompany him on his last trip and I welcome the intention of the mayor of Montreal to make a permanent place for him to his measure in his city, ”continued the leader of the official opposition.
“Leonard Cohen has honored us all over the world; he is undoubtedly one of the proudest representatives of Quebec culture. His work is very important and prolific. We support the will of the government, based on that of Leonard Cohen&#39;s family, that a national funeral be held, to salute his exceptional contribution to our national culture and to show the attachment of Quebecers to his work ”, for his part declared Martine Ouellet.
“We would like to express our deepest condolences to Mr. Cohen&#39;s family and loved ones, especially his children, Adam and Lorca. We want them to know that Quebecers are in communion of spirit with their grief, ”concluded Mr. Lisée and Ms. Ouellet.
