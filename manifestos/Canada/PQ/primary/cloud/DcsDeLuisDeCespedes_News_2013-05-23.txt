Quebec - In reaction to the death of Luis De Cespedes, the Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, expressed his sadness at the disappearance of this actor who has enjoyed success on both the small and the big screen.
&quot;I want to salute the memory of this artist whose talent has been appreciated on television and in the cinema,&quot; said Minister Kotto. Luis De Cespedes was a sympathetic and caring man, according to his former colleagues. In addition to his acting talent, he was an exceptional voice actor and we will still be able to, at the very least, hear his voice in more than one film dubbed in Quebec. His departure is distressing. ‚Äù
Of Peruvian and Cuban origin, Luis De Cespedes lived in Paris, New York and in several Latin American countries before settling in Quebec. In addition to the role of Count Juan in Marisol, a role that marked female viewers at the time, he also played Richard Pincourt in L&#39;or du temps, a series presented from 1985 to 1993. Luis De Cespedes continued his career as voice actor for film, which led him to lend his voices to Al Pacino, Danny DeVito, Antonio Banderas and Bruce Willis, to name a few. Luis De Cespedes died of Parkinson&#39;s disease at just 64 years old.
The Minister wishes to offer his most sincere condolences to the family of Luis De Cespedes.
