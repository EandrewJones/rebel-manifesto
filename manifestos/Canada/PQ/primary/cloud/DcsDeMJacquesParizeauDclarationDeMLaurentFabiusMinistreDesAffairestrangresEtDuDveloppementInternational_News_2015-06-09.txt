Statement by Mr. Laurent Fabius:
It is with sadness that I learned of the death of former Premier of Quebec Jacques Parizeau. I extend my sincere condolences to his wife, to his family, as well as to all Quebecers.
Mr. Parizeau devoted his life to Quebec, first as an architect of the great reforms of the Quiet Revolution, then as Prime Minister. He is a great Quebecer who is disappearing.
France, with which Jacques Parizeau had maintained strong ties since his studies in Paris, has lost a friend who has greatly contributed to the development of the special relationship between our two governments, our businesses and our citizens.
His constant commitment to the service of Quebec and his friendship for France will remain in our memories.
