Quebec City - Charlevoix Leader of the Official Opposition and MP Pauline Marois and Bourget MP and Culture and Communications Spokeswoman Maka Kotto offer their sincere condolences to the family, loved ones, friends as well as to all Quebeckers who have known and appreciated former journalist and diplomat Michel Roy.
“With the death of Michel Roy, half a century of journalism, in the best tradition, has died out. He left his mark on Quebec journalism with the elegance of his pen, notably in the dailies Le Devoir and La Presse, but also on Radio-Canada and CKAC, at the start of his long career. Journalist, columnist, editor-in-chief, he also reflected a great deal on the profession and the situation of journalism in Quebec, first as a professor of journalism and above all, as president, from 1997 to 2004, of the Quebec Press Council. Michel Roy was also a leading diplomat since he was ambassador in Tunisia and in charge of mission in Libya, Jordan and Algeria ”, declared Pauline Marois.
“At a time when the Quebec journalistic community is in full reflection on the future of information in Quebec, the professional qualities and analyzes of Michel Roy on the practice of journalism will remain a source of inspiration, both for people of the profession than for the general public. Quebec has just lost a brilliant intellectual, ”concluded Maka Kotto.
