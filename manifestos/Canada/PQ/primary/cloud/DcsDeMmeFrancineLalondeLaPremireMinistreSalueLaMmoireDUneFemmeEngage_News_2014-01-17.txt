Montreal - Moved by the death of Ms. Francine Lalonde, the Premier of Quebec paid tribute to the memory of a woman she considers a model of commitment. “As much as a trade unionist as a minister or member of Parliament, Francine Lalonde has dedicated her life to serving her fellow citizens. A sovereignist activist at heart, passionate about social justice and a great defender of women&#39;s rights, she has always shown, in each of the positions she has occupied, determination and elegance ”, declared Pauline Marois first. .
The Prime Minister also mentioned a cause that was very dear to the former member of the Bloc Québécois, end-of-life care, which the members of the National Assembly are addressing these days. “While Bill 52 yesterday passed the detailed study stage in parliamentary committee, I cannot help emphasizing the pioneering role that Francine Lalonde played in this file. In the House of Commons, she courageously introduced a reflection, which has become necessary, on the right to die with dignity. Thanks to her perseverance, Ms. Lalonde helped make possible the adoption, in Quebec, of such a law. &quot;
The future of Quebec has also always been at the heart of the struggles of this committed woman. “As her party&#39;s foreign affairs spokesperson in the House of Commons, Francine Lalonde represented Quebec with dignity. She has established an immense network of contacts for the benefit of the Quebec nation. Today, many people, all over Quebec and elsewhere in the world, are in mourning for this exceptional woman. &quot;
The Premier offered her deepest condolences to the family and friends of Francine Lalonde, who accompanied her to the end. “Our thoughts are with you,” concluded Ms. Marois.
