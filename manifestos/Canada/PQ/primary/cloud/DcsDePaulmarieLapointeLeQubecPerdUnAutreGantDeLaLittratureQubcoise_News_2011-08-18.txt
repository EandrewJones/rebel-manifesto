Montreal - Following the announcement of the death of Paul-Marie Lapointe, Charlevoix Leader of the Official Opposition and MP Pauline Marois, and Drummond MP and Culture and Communications Spokesperson Yves -François Blanchet, offer their most sincere condolences to family, relatives, friends and all Quebeckers who have known and appreciated the work that has become a must for the poet Paul-Marie Lapointe.
“It is with deep sadness that we learned of the death of the great Quebec poet Paul-Marie Lapointe, who will leave an indelible mark on the history of Quebec literature. He was undoubtedly one of our greatest poets and his unique and magnificent work will remain eternal in the hearts of all Quebecers ”, declared Pauline Marois.
“This genius of words has also received numerous awards commensurate with his exceptional talent, such as the Athanase-David Prize in 1971, the Governor General of Canada Prize in 1972 for Le Réel absolu, the prize of International Poetry Forum of the United States in 1976, the La Presse newspaper prize in 1980, the Grand prix de poésie de la francophonie and the Léopold Sedar Senghor prize in 1998, ”added the leader of the official opposition.
“Gaston Miron said of him that he was the greatest poet that Quebec has produced since the French Regime. How can we not be amazed by reading the Burned Virgin or the Absolute Real, whose beauty and strength of writing are incomparable? Quebec has just lost one of its great men and Quebec literature is orphaned by one of its greatest geniuses, ”added Yves-François Blanchet.
