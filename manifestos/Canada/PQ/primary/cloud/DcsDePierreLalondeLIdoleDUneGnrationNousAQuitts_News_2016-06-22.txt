Quebec - The MNA for Jonquière and Leader of the Official Opposition, Sylvain Gaudreault, as well as the MNA for Joliette and Parti Québécois spokesperson for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, salute the work and career of M Pierre Lalonde, whose death was announced today.
“First of all, on behalf of the members of the official opposition, I would like to offer my most sincere condolences to the family, friends and many admirers of Mr. Pierre Lalonde. We will all keep fond memories of the one who was one of the leading figures of the Quebec cultural scene of the 1960s and 1970s, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
“Pierre Lalonde will have had a long and prolific career, both on stage and on the small screen. With good reason, it is said of him that he was &quot;the idol of a generation&quot;; he will forever embody the spirit of the yé-yé era, of the emancipation of youth. Her unique gestures and laughter, which resonated throughout the United States, are certainly part of our cultural heritage, ”added Véronique Hivon.
“The songs that Pierre Lalonde performed are timeless. The legacy he leaves behind is therefore doomed to live on for a long time to come. I invite all Quebecers to revisit its repertoire; to pay tribute to the man, certainly, but also because he illuminates and rejoices the hearts, inevitably ”, concluded the leader of the official opposition.
