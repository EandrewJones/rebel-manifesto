Quebec - In reaction to the death of Robert Roussil, the Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, paid tribute to this great Quebec sculptor who shared his life between France and Quebec, and whose works can be admired in Montreal, Nice, or Quito, Ecuador. As an example, we will retain the monumental sculpture in homage to René-Lévesque, located in René-Lévesque Park in Lachine, produced in 1988.
Coming from a modest family in Montreal and the penultimate of nine children, Robert Roussil left school very early to do a host of odd jobs. In 1942, he enlisted in the army and on his return from the war, in 1945, he joined the School of Art and Design of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts where he learned different techniques in sculpture. . He participated in the renowned Montreal International Sculpture Symposium in 1964. Convinced that a sculpture is not just a decorative element, he created the concept of inhabitable sculpture.
“Robert Roussil was an artist, a visionary and an activist. He has been an ardent defender of the arts integrated into architecture since the 1960s. His works described by some as powerful and striking have made it possible in particular to open minds to less conventional forms of expression. Quebec is losing a great sculptor, as great as his masterful works that will keep him alive in our memories, ”said Minister Kotto. The Minister wished to express his condolences to the relatives and the family of Robert Roussil.
