Quebec - The member for Bourget and official opposition spokesperson for culture and communications, Maka Kotto, paid tribute to comedian Serge Grenier who died last Friday in Longueuil.
“Serge Grenier and his three companions, members of the famous group of comedians Les Cyniques, will have left their mark on Quebec humor, even on Quebec society in the 1960s, then in the midst of the Quiet Revolution. By shaking up many taboos with the most biting humor, Serge Grenier will have left his mark. With Yvon Deschamps, among others, Les Cyniques will trace the path of several generations of comedians who will not hesitate to dip their pens in the sometimes acid ink of social criticism ”, underlined Maka Kotto.
“Quebec is also losing a talented author and screenwriter who contributed to significant events in our humor and our television. He has participated in Bye Bye, Galas Juste pour rire, of which he was also the first host in 1983, as well as in several humorous programs and in numerous finely written columns, emphasizing the intelligence and the quality of the French language, ”continued the member for Bourget.
Maka Kotto, on behalf of the Leader of the Official Opposition, Pauline Marois, and her colleagues from the parliamentary wing of the Parti Québécois, offers the family and loved ones of Serge Grenier its most sincere condolences.
