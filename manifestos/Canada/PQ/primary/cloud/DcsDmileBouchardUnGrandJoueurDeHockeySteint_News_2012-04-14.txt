Montreal - The Leader of the Official Opposition and Member of Parliament for Charlevoix, Pauline Marois, paid tribute to former Montreal Canadiens player Émile Bouchard, who died this morning after a long illness.
“Émile &#39;Butch&#39; Bouchard was one of the most illustrious players in Canadian history. Considered a giant, not least because of his physical appearance, the defender was the team captain for eight years and won the Stanley Cup four times. A member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, number 3 will remain etched in the memory of Quebecers forever, ”said Pauline Marois, recalling the attachment and pride that Émile Bouchard had for Quebec.
The Parti Québécois is happy to have contributed to its recognition by having instigated a motion in the National Assembly to support the withdrawal of Émile Bouchard&#39;s jersey in 2009.
Pauline Marois and the members of the parliamentary wing of the Parti Québécois have come together to offer the family and loved ones of Émile Bouchard as well as the team of the Montreal Canadiens their most sincere condolences.
