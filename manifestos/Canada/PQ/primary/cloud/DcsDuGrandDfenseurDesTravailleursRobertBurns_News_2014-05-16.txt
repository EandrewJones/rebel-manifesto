Quebec - It is with sadness that the leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, learned of the death of Mr. Robert Burns, who passed away yesterday at the Source Bleue palliative care home, located in Boucherville. He was 77 years old.
“On behalf of the great family of the Parti Québécois and on my behalf, I offer my most sincere condolences to Mr. Burns&#39; spouse, Lorraine, as well as to his family and loved ones. Robert Burns has dedicated his life to defending workers&#39; rights. Today we are losing a man of rights and a politician committed to the people of Quebec, ”said Stéphane Bédard.
Retired judge of the Court of Quebec, assigned to the Labor Court from 1980 to 2001, Mr. Burns was one of the first seven elected members of the Parti Québécois in 1970. Member of Parliament for Maisonneuve, he held several positions in the opposition and was a minister in the office of Prime Minister René Lévesque. A well-known lawyer, he had made a name for himself in the world of work, working for several years in the union world.

Robert Burns is also the father of the law on the financing of political parties. He had it adopted in 1977 as Minister of State for Electoral and Parliamentary Reform. Considered at the time to be one of the strictest in the Western world, it was the first law to prohibit companies from financing a political party.
“This great law made Quebeckers proud. Inestimable heritage from the first government of René Lévesque, it was an important step in the consolidation of political mores in Quebec and in the fight against corruption, ”concluded Stéphane Bédard.
Mr. Burns&#39; family have said details of the funeral ceremony will be released at a later date.
