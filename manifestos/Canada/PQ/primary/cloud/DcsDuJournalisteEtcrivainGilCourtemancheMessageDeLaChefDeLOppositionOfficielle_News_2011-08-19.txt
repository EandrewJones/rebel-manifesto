Montreal, Friday August 19, 2011 - On behalf of the parliamentary wing of the Parti Québécois, the Leader of the Official Opposition and Member of Parliament for Charlevoix, Pauline Marois, offers her condolences to the family, relatives, friends and colleagues of the journalist and writer Gil Courtemanche, deceased today.
“Gil Courtemanche was in a class of its own. Committed, the incisive pen, the free verb, he belonged to a journalistic genre that we see less and less: the one who denounces. Always on the side of the victims, never complacent with the powerful, he will have made us discover unacceptable situations, everywhere in the world, as in Quebec ”, commented the leader of the official opposition.
While famine is falling in the Horn of Africa, Pauline Marois recalled that Gil Courtemanche had been one of the initiators, on the return of a report in Ethiopia, of the artists&#39; collective Les eyes de la hungry in 1985. He had also written the text of this superb song whose fruits of the sale were intended to support the Ethiopian populations.
“Gil Courtemanche was indignant, but he also acted. He was one of those who said to themselves: “Never, never again should we tolerate such a situation!” The simple fact of noting that it is necessary, even today, to intervene in this humanitarian crisis is enough to show us that we will need other Gil Courtemanche to inform us, to indignant us and to make us change ”, declared Pauline Marois.
