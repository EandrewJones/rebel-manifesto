London - On behalf of the government, the Premier of Quebec, Ms. Pauline Marois, wishes to convey her deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of the former Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, Mr. Martial Asselin.
“The people back home, in Charlevoix, got to know him early in his career as a politician, since he first got involved in the local scene. But it is at the level of Quebec and Canada that Mr. Asselin will have distinguished himself the most. He commanded immense respect. He was also an authority figure and a model of commitment. Quebec is losing a man of great righteousness, ”said the Premier.
Mr. Asselin was admitted to the Quebec Bar in 1951. He entered municipal politics in the late 1950s, becoming mayor of La Malbaie, in his region of origin. He then held the position of Member of Parliament for Charlevoix in the House of Commons, became Minister, then member of the Senate. From 1990 to 1996, he served as lieutenant-governor of Quebec. During his life, he received several honors and distinctions.
