Québec, December 14, 2016 –Member of Duplessis, Lorraine Richard, asks to hear Hydro-Québec and the Committee on Standards, Equity, Health and Safety at Work (CNESST) in parliamentary committee to obtain answers to the questions raised by the four deaths that have occurred on the Romaine site since 2010.
“Hydro-Québec and the CNESST must tell us what measures were put in place following the deaths of Gaétan Saucier, in 2010, of Steeve Barriault, in March 2015, and of Alex Antoine Proulx, last August. We looked for the fastest way to guarantee explanations to Romaine workers and their families: it is a parliamentary committee, ”said Lorraine Richard.
“When we have passed the commission stage, if the answers obtained are not satisfactory or if they demonstrate a generalized problem, we do not close the door to the idea of requesting a commission of inquiry. That said, our goal here is speed. We should also mention that the creation of a working committee, announced by Hydro-Québec, is clearly insufficient, ”added the Member.
“We have now reached the fourth death. We must act to reassure families and workers. They should not be worried when they go to the site; Hydro-Québec must therefore demonstrate that their safety will henceforth be ensured when they go there. Finally, on behalf of my fellow members of the Parti Québécois, I offer my most sincere condolences to the family and loved ones of Luc Arpin, ”concluded Lorraine Richard.
