The parties announce that they have amicably settled the libel action instituted by Lynne Harpin and Nicole Savard following statements made by Agnès Maltais in November 2016 relating to certain confidential documents of the Parti Québécois.
When she left, Ms. Harpin brought a USB key on which there were documents, some of which contained, without her realizing, confidential data. Ms. Harpin and Ms. Savard never used or disclosed these materials to anyone and never intended to do so.
In view of the foregoing, Ms. Maltais and the Parti Québécois recognize that the allegations made against Ms. Harpin and Ms. Savard were unfounded. At no time did Ms. Maltais and the Parti Québécois want to damage the reputation of Ms. Harpin and Ms. Savard, and did not wish to cause them harm.
The terms of the settlement remain confidential and the parties have agreed to make no further comments.
