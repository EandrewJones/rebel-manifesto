Québec, November 3, 2014 - Nicole Léger, the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition critic for elementary and secondary education and school perseverance, notes the very low participation rate in school elections and concludes that the status quo is no longer acceptable.
School democracy “Despite the fact that the issue has been widely discussed in the public arena in recent months, citizens did not mobilize during yesterday&#39;s poll. It is clear that it does not work, ”observes the member of the Parti Québécois.
“School democracy is in a dire situation, but that does not mean that we should exclude citizens from decisions made in Quebec schools. Rather, we believe in reviewing decision-making bodies so that parents remain at the heart of governance, ”she continued.
Groupings of school boards The Parti Québécois recalls that it advocates a reorganization of school boards. To do this, he proposes to:
“Whatever the changes to come in the education network, academic success and perseverance must be the government&#39;s priorities. We intend to follow behind the Liberal Party on this subject, since it seems to focus more on the columns of expenditure figures - as can be seen from the cuts it has made in homework assistance and food aid, in particular - that the future of our children, ”concluded Nicole Léger.
