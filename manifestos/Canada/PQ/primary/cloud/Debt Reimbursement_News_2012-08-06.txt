Montreal - The Parti Québécois candidate in the riding of Rousseau, Nicolas Marceau, questions the commitment made today by the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) to bring the debt of Quebec to the same level as that of the other Canadian provinces in ten years.
“To fulfill this promise, François Legault would have to repay an amount of $ 81.5 billion over the next ten years. It plans to do so by paying all of the royalties collected on non-renewable natural resources, which it does not plan to increase. Mining revenues are estimated at some $ 4 billion over the next decade. The head of the CAQ also plans to allocate the royalties collected on oil to the repayment of the debt, ”he explained, adding that François Legault should know that these sums are hypothetical since no oil company plans to pay royalties. before 2015, at best.
“François Legault should also remember an elementary notion of public finances: half of the royalties collected by the government of Quebec are retained by the federal government through the equalization system. It is therefore technically impossible to promise to allocate more than half of these royalties as long as the equalization formula is not changed, ”continued Nicolas Marceau.
“Consequently, to achieve its commitment, namely to bring Quebec&#39;s debt to the same level as that of the other provinces by affecting all of the royalties collected on non-renewable resources, it will take more than 400 years,” concluded Nicolas Marceau. .
