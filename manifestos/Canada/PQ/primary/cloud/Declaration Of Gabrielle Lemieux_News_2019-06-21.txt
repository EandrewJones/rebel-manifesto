Montreal, June 21, 2019 - Parti Québécois President Gabrielle Lemieux has issued the following statement regarding her departure next November:
“I have decided that my term as President of the Parti Québécois will end next November, during the National Extraordinary Congress. As a volunteer, I have to face the challenge of reconciling work, family and political involvement. I&#39;ve managed to pick it up over the past two years, but in November the time will be right for me to retire.
I deeply believe in the recovery process that we initiated last March and that is why I am choosing to stay in my post until the November Congress, in order to bring it to an end. This approach is a first, since we have chosen to modernize our party in depth and without taboos while postponing the race for leadership.
I am proud to have led the proposal for an action plan at the start of the year, which was unanimously adopted by the National Council in March. This action plan for a new Parti Québécois is supported by a competent and dedicated national executive council, a solid general management, a parliamentary leader and a committed and passionate caucus. I have every confidence that the succession to the presidency next November will be able to lead the implementation of the changes voted in Congress and organize the leadership race. »Concluded the president of the Parti Québécois, Gabrielle Lemieux.
