Montreal, February 1, 2017 - The members of the Parti Québécois&#39; Priorité PME team, namely the deputies Alain Therrien (Sanguinet), Mireille Jean (Chicoutimi) and Martin Ouellet (René? Lévesque), are concerned about the decline in Quebec exports in the United States for the year 2016.
“Data released yesterday by Desjardins indicates that our exports to the United States fell 3.5% in 2016. The Couillard government&#39;s inaction caused us to miss an opportunity to grow our exports, when the context was favorable . Indeed, the US administration viewed free trade positively, US demand was growing steadily, and the exchange rate was good for us. In short, this decline is another failure to add to the already embarrassing economic bulletin of the Liberal government, ”said Alain Therrien.
“The Minister of the Economy, Dominique Anglade, has provided only a meager sum of $ 25 million to help SMEs to export; this is clearly insufficient. SMEs are at the heart of the Quebec economy, and they need stronger measures to support them in their efforts on international markets, particularly in the United States, ”continued Mireille Jean.
One sector in particular must be a priority for the government, according to the Parti Québécois. “Quebec must demand the inclusion of softwood lumber in any negotiations related to the reopening of NAFTA. For the economy of our regions to recover, we must, among other things, promote the growth of our lumber exports, ”said Martin Ouellet in closing.
