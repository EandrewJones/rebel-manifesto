Quebec - The MP for Vachon and official opposition spokesperson for transport, Martine Ouellet, and the members of the Parti Québécois de l&#39;Est du Québec, Lorraine Richard (Duplessis), Marjolain Dufour (René-Lévesque), Pascal Bérubé (Matane-Matapédia), Sylvain Roy (Bonaventure) and Gaétan Lelièvre (Gaspé), deplored the reduction in the services offered by the air carrier Pascan, and ask the Liberal government to intervene to avoid the isolation of our regions.
“The Pascan company is considerably reducing its services. In fact, it is cutting them in half in Gaspésie, Bonaventure, Îles-de-la-Madeleine and on the North Shore, not to mention that it is completely ceasing its activities in Gatineau and Havre-Saint-Pierre. However, transport is an essential element for the socio-economic development of our regions, already undermined by liberal policies. Consequently, we ask the government to study the possibilities of intervention available to it to prevent the isolation of eastern Quebec from worsening, ”said Martine Ouellet.
“Access to our regions is an essential aspect of the occupation of our territory. Our fellow citizens, who are already having to deal with a reduction in public transport and rail services, are all the more worried. For our economy and our social development, we affirm our solidarity with the population and ask the government to listen, ”concluded the members of the Parti Québécois de l&#39;Est du Québec.
