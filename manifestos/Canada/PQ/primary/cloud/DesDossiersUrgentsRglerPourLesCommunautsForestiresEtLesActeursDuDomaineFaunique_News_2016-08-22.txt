Spruce budworm in private forests “In addition, while the epidemic is progressing at lightning speed, there is still no assistance plan for small forest producers who are struggling with the budworm. spruce. The new minister must propose three things: a plan, jointly with the federal government, for watering young stands, a marketing strategy for prematurely cut wood, and another for reforestation. And we must act quickly; As long as the government does not act, many owners will continue to sacrifice a significant portion of their forestry capital, ”added Sylvain Roy.
Increase in the cost of wildlife permits for voluntary organizations “Finally, Luc Blanchette must absolutely abandon the bad idea of his predecessor, Laurent Lessard, who introduced a tax on volunteering. The increase in permit prices of up to $ 2,477 is simply unacceptable; these volunteers carry out wildlife development in addition to the work of the ministry! », Concluded the member for Bonaventure.
