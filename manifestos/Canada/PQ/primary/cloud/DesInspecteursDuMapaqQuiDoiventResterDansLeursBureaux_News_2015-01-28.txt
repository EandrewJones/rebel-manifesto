Quebec - The member for Berthier and official opposition critic for agriculture, fisheries and food, André Villeneuve, denounces the information published in the media according to which food inspection officials in remote region would be locked in their offices of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The inspectors say they have been informed orally of this &quot;risk management policy&quot; which forces them to limit their outings to emergencies.
“Liberal-Caquista austerity, we see the results in all regions of Quebec. Food and restaurant inspection are sacrificed here. How do you make sure food is safe when you can&#39;t see it? This is total nonsense. The Liberal government&#39;s cuts endanger the health and safety of Quebec consumers, ”said André Villeneuve.
Since taking office, the Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, has spoken a lot about the fact that he wants to make legislative changes, particularly with regard to the repackaging of food and animal welfare. However, without the presence of inspectors in the field, these possible modifications will have no effect.
“The minister is always ready to change the law, but if he does not allow inspectors to go into the field to enforce it, there is no point in changing it. Without the presence of inspectors to carry out the necessary checks, the health and safety of Quebecers remain at risk. With his technical changes, the minister gives himself the impression of acting, but for the population, the safety of the products is still not guaranteed. Endangering people&#39;s health to respond to the austere demands of his colleague Martin Coiteux, with the approval of the Prime Minister, demonstrates a flagrant lack of judgment on the part of Minister Paradis, ”concluded the spokesperson.
