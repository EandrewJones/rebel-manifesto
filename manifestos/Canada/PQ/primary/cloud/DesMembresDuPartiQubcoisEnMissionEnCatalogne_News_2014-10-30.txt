Montreal, October 30, 2014 -The Parti Québécois announces that some of its members will be going to Catalonia to observe the popular consultation on the region&#39;s self-determination, which will be held on November 9.
The delegation will be chaired by Daniel Turp, former member of the Parti Québécois and professor of international and constitutional law at the University of Montreal, currently member of the international relations committee of the Parti Québécois.

We wish to observe the unfolding of the process leading to the November 9 consultation, and to establish contacts with the separatist parties and movements which are at the origin of them, ”said Daniel Turp.
The CNJPQ has called for candidates for the selection of the youth activist who will join the delegation. “We received around thirty applications, all of high quality.
