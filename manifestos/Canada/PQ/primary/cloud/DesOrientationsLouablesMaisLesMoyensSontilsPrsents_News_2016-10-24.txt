Quebec, October 24, 2016 –According to the Parti Québécois spokesperson for public health, prevention and healthy lifestyles, Sylvain Pagé, “the government policy on health prevention, which was made public yesterday, includes directions and targets that are laudable. That said, we are wondering about the means that will be available to reach them ”.
“Liberal austerity has hit the public health sector hard, as the government made a recurring cut of $ 23.7 million in 2015-2016. However, everything indicates that the reinvestment announced yesterday will not fill this shortfall, ”noted the spokesperson.
A question for Minister Charlebois &quot;I have a question for the Minister for Rehabilitation, Youth Protection, Public Health and Healthy Lifestyles: What proportion of the $ 76 million announced on Sunday will be reinjected into the during the current term of his government? The Minister must be transparent and tell us how much money will actually be invested in the short term because this amount is planned for a period of 10 years… ”, Sylvain Pagé continued.
Since the Liberal government took office, the Parti Québécois has strongly denounced cuts in public health, which include prevention, vaccination, surveillance of infectious diseases, prevention of smoking, early detection of cancer, etc. “Investing in public health and prevention pays off in the long term. We will continue to hound the government on this until it realizes that it is time to act. Yesterday, there were seven ministers on hand for this announcement. If the money is not there now, it will be necessary to conclude that the presence of all these beautiful people was only a setting in scene to make forget the sad reality ”, added Sylvain Pagé.
