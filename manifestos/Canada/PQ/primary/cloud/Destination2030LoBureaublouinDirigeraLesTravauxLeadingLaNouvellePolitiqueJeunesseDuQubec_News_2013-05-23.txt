Quebec - The Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, entrusts Léo Bureau-Blouin, her parliamentary assistant for youth issues and Member of Parliament for Laval-des-Rapides, with the mandate of leading the work leading to the development of the new youth policy of Quebec. Members of Parliament for Saint-Jean, Dave Turcotte, and Terrebonne, Mathieu Traversy, will assist him in carrying out his mandate.
“In 2030, Léo Bureau-Blouin will be 38 years old. It is for young people of this age that we must rethink our youth policy. As of tomorrow, the government is undertaking a new participatory approach in the design of its public policies. In addition to a tour of the regions, an innovative website will make it possible to collect the thoughts of young people to define the Quebec of 2030, ”said Pauline Marois.
Initially, Léo Bureau-Blouin will lead a tour of all regions of Quebec in order to meet young people. Until September, the member for Laval-des-Rapides and his colleagues will carry out this tour with three objectives: to raise awareness, mobilize and consult young people and the population on the challenges that await Quebec in 2030, so that they can promote their opinions, priorities and initiatives.
To take into account the reality of young people, a brand new website is also launched today. This platform, inspired by the interaction principles of Web 2.0, was developed using free software. It offers a new interactivity to maximize citizen participation. All young people in Quebec are invited to visit this site, to make it their own and to leave their mark on it.
The government will make the conclusions of this consultation known in a white paper to be tabled in the fall. The fruit of regional consultation, virtual contributions and analyzes by departments and agencies will form the basis of Québec&#39;s next youth policy. The white paper will be studied in parliamentary committee by the end of 2013.
