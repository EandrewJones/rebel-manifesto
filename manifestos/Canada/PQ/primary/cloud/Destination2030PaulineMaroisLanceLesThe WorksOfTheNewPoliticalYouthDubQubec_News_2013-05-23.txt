Quebec - The Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, today launched work on the next youth policy, along with her parliamentary assistant for youth issues and Member of Parliament for Laval-des-Rapides, Léo Bureau-Blouin. As of tomorrow, the government is launching a vast consultation exercise with Quebec youth to define the Quebec of 2030. This is a unique participatory process that will be carried out in a completely new way in the design of public policies. .
“In the spring of 2012, many young people spoke out to demand changes in our society. Since September 4, we have re-established dialogue with Quebec youth. We have restored social peace and put an end to the clashes. It is now imperative to equip ourselves with mechanisms and ways of doing things so that political decision-makers are never cut off from the rising generation again, ”said Pauline Marois.
Listening to Quebec youth is a trademark of the governments of the Parti Québécois. In 1983, René Lévesque held the first Quebec Youth Summit, which led to the creation of the Youth Secretariat and the Permanent Youth Council. Then, in 2000, Lucien Bouchard invited young people to the Quebec and Youth Summit. This exercise gave birth to the first Québec youth policy and the creation of the Fonds Jeunesse Québec.
