Quebec - “To note, two years after the earthquake that devastated Haiti in January 2010, that barely half of the people that Quebec was supposed to welcome under the program put in place by the Liberal government have actually arrived in Quebec is totally unacceptable. , even shocking ”.
This was declared by the member for Drummond and official opposition critic for immigration and cultural communities, Yves-François Blanchet, after learning that Quebec has awarded 5,978 selection certificates in the under its special humanitarian sponsorship program for Haiti. Yet only half of those selected under this specific program received their immigrant visa from Ottawa.
“Minister Kathleen Weil needs to put her angelicism aside and act. To say that Ottawa&#39;s delays are acceptable is appalling. Her prime minister made promises to the Haitian people two years ago, but she now says she does not intend to do everything to keep this promise. It is shameful! », Lambasted MP Blanchet.
According to him, it is very clear that the federal government has never had any serious desire to simplify administrative procedures, even for obvious humanitarian reasons. &quot;We have here, once again, an eloquent demonstration that, when Quebec will hold all the powers in immigration matters, such situations will be avoided, because we will establish our own procedures without having to request the final authorization from a other nation. In the meantime, humanitarian reasons, political recuperation and the lack of respect that Ottawa gives to the decisions of Quebec leave thousands of Haitians to suffer from misery and uncertainty. Minister Weil must achieve it quickly and act, ”concluded Yves-François Blanchet.
