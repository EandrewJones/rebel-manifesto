Quebec - The Parti Québécois urges the Premier of Quebec, Jean Charest, to apologize for the police slippage that took place this morning in Montreal, resulting in the imprisonment of two journalists from the daily La Presse.
“The student conflict is escalating to such an extent that the police today arrest two duly accredited journalists covering a demonstration. What kind of world are we in to experience such a slippage? Quebec is a democratic society where the exercise of the profession of journalist must be able to be done in peace. Jean Charest must quickly apologize, ”declared the member for Chambly and official opposition spokesperson for public security, Bertrand St-Arnaud.
The member for Chambly said he was worried to see several police abuses related to the work of journalists lately. “The cavalier attitude a few weeks ago towards the journalist from the Journal de Montréal who only did his job is just as unacceptable. The Prime Minister and his Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, must quickly remind the police authorities of a certain number of elementary democratic principles, ”continued Bertrand St-Arnaud.
The Parti Québécois also denounces all acts of violence and mischief by way of demonstration. “The use of any form of violence to convey a message to the government and elected officials is reprehensible. The current situation is getting worse and the first responsible is the Liberal government. It is time for Jean Charest to put aside his pride and invite the students to discuss calmly around a work table since his Minister of Education, Line Beauchamp, has lost all legitimacy and credibility ”, concluded, for for her part, the member for Taillon and official opposition critic for higher education and loans and bursaries, Marie Malavoy.
