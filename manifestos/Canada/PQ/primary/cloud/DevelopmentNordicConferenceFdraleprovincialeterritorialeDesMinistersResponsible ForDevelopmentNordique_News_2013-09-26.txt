Quebec - On the sidelines of the Northern Development Forum, which took place in Fort McMurray from September 23 to 25, the Minister of Natural Resources, Ms. Martine Ouellet, is able to observe that Quebec shares many of the issues that are common to provinces and territories. During this conference, the Minister was represented by her Associate Secretary General for Northern Development, Mr. Bernard Lauzon, who led the Quebec delegation.
Quebec wished to point out that the end of federal funding for social housing and the end of operating agreements covering social housing in Nunavik are problematic given the needs, which are important.
Quebec has also informed its colleagues that its government has recently undertaken to study solutions for telecommunications in Nunavik, since it considers it to be an essential service for its residents.
Martine Ouellet reiterated that natural resources come under the jurisdiction of Quebec and indicated that:
&quot;Quebec promotes discussions on a bilateral basis with other governments that share a common interest on subjects specific to the fields of natural resources, while respecting constitutional jurisdiction.&quot;
The Minister added that Bill 43 amending the Mining Act will ensure greater transparency throughout the operation of a mine as well as maximize the benefits for local and regional communities through the &#39;&#39; through agreements and local committees. For Martine Ouellet, transparency is an essential element in establishing a climate of trust between the population and the industry, an essential element for the success of mining projects.
Finally, Quebec has undertaken to participate, insofar as it deems appropriate, in the pursuit of the activities of the sub-working groups in relation to the priorities established for 2014.
