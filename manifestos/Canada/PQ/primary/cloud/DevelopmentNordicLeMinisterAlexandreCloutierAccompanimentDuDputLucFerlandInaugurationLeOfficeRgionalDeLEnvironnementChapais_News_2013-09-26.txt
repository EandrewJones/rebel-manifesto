Chapais - The Minister for Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, the Canadian Francophonie and Sovereignty Governance and Minister responsible for the Nord-du-Québec region, Mr. Alexandre Cloutier, accompanied by the Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Natural Resources ( Nordic affairs section) and MP for Ungava, Mr. Luc Ferland, on behalf of the Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet, today inaugurated the regional office from Chapais. The opening of this office allows the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks (MDDEFP) to consolidate its presence in northern territory.
“Given the growing challenges linked to the rapid development of the northern territory, the presence of a regional office was essential. We will now have the necessary tools to be able to intervene more efficiently and quickly when needed. I am convinced that the team in place will be an invaluable resource for the region and that it will develop and evolve according to local and regional needs, ”declared Minister Cloutier.
“The choice of Chapais was the subject of a consensus among regional stakeholders. This office is linked to the regional directorate of Abitibi-Témiscamingue and Nord-du-Québec, which is a northern center of expertise and mining for the Department. The Chapais office is responsible for ensuring consistency, at the national level, in the application of laws and regulations governing the mining sector, and the coordination of the Department&#39;s interventions in northern territory. In addition, a liaison officer position facilitates contacts between the Department and the Cree, Inuit and Naskapi communities present in the territory, ”said Mr. Ferland.
The opening of this new office in Chapais opens the door to more efficient management of resources, while respecting communities and the environment. This is a major asset for the smooth running of regional operations.
