Quebec - The Minister of Natural Resources, Martine Ouellet, announces the award of a mining lease to Arcelor Mittal for its Lac Hessé project, which will allow the expansion of the Mont-Wright mining site. Iron extraction operations will begin within a few weeks.
“The expansion of the Mont-Wright mining site means 725 additional jobs over a period of nearly 30 years. This is excellent news for the Côte-Nord region, where the mining industry is at the heart of economic development, ”said Martine Ouellet.
In the spirit of the tabling of Bill 43, for a new mining law, the Minister asked Arcelor Mittal to voluntarily submit a feasibility study to increase the processing of iron ore in Quebec. Arcelor Mittal already has an iron processing plant in Port Cartier as well as processing plants in Contrecoeur and Montreal. The study to increase processing in its current facilities or in new facilities may be submitted in the next year.
The new mine site will increase production from 15 to 24 million tonnes of iron concentrate. Arcelor Mittal&#39;s investment for the Mont-Wright project amounts to $ 1.2 billion. This includes the operation of the mine as well as work on the railway and at the port facilities in Sept-Îles.
“I am very happy that Arcelor Mittal is starting operations at Lac Hessé. These are major spinoffs for the region, and more particularly for the MRC of Caniapiscau, ”said Lorraine Richard, Member of Parliament for Duplessis.
Of the 725 additional jobs that will be created, 525 jobs will be for the mining site and 200 jobs for railway work as well as port facilities. Currently, nearly 1,000 employees work at the Mont-Wright mining complex.
