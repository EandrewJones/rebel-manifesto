Montreal, February 8, 2018 – At the end of the National Council of January 27 and 28, the Parti Québécois is proud to announce that Dieudonné Ella Oyono, economist in her professional career, was elected by acclamation chairman of the diversity committee of the Parti Québécois.
The mandate of the Diversity Committee is to bring together Quebeckers of diverse origins and to formulate recommendations regarding the Parti Québécois&#39; approach to diversity. “The mandate that I am beginning will allow me to be involved in decisions concerning the positions and initiatives of our political party vis-à-vis Quebec diversity. But it is also an opportunity for me to continue the discussion with the members of diversity on the proposals of the Parti Québécois; on the independence of Quebec and on accessible public services, of quality and at the service of the people ”declared Mr. Ella Oyono.
Concretely, the Parti Québécois has already taken modern and adapted proposals in the files of integration into the labor market, access to housing and the fight against discrimination and racism. “The Parti Québécois is resolutely committed to the reception and integration of Quebecers with an immigrant background. This approach has received a favorable reception, moreover, while more and more members from diverse backgrounds are present in the bodies of the Parti Québécois. In view of the October 1 election, I intend to ensure that the commitments to fight discrimination are an integral part of the electoral platform. »Concluded Dieudonné Ella Oyono.
