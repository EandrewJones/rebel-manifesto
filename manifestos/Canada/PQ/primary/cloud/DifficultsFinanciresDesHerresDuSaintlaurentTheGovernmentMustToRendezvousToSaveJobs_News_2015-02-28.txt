Québec– The MNA for Saint-Jérôme and official opposition spokesperson for the economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, as well as the MNA for Berthier and spokesperson for of agriculture, André Villeneuve, deplore the financial difficulties of the Serres du Saint-Laurent, a company producing Savoura tomatoes, and ask the government to be on the lookout in order to save jobs.
“Our thoughts are with the 200 workers at Serres du Saint-Laurent who, with the company&#39;s financial difficulties, find themselves in uncertainty today. The government must be there if ever support is needed to maintain jobs. In addition, in the context where a new buyer is required, it is desirable that the interests of the company remain in the hands of Quebec entrepreneurs, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“With a view to food sovereignty and local purchasing, the Parti Québécois government had implemented a measure to reduce the energy cost of greenhouses, by offering them a lower electricity rate. We must do everything to preserve this expertise at home and to offer Quebec consumers products from here, ”concluded André Villeneuve.
