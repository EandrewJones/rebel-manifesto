Quebec - The member for L&#39;Assomption and official opposition critic for the environment, sustainable development and parks, Scott McKay, is unimpressed by the remarks made today by the Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks, Pierre Arcand, on his government&#39;s fight against climate change and greenhouse gases (GHGs).
“When the minister talks about the target of -6% compared to 1990 as being the target for Quebec, he is reneging on Quebec&#39;s commitment. He is reneging on the commitments made by his own government to achieve the targets set out in the Kyoto Protocol, ”laments Scott McKay, who attended the Minister&#39;s speech this afternoon before the Montreal Council on International Relations.
“The Minister neglects to say that the result of -2.5% of GHG emissions for 2009 compared to 1990 is due to the economic recession and closures in the pulp and paper sector. He also omits to say that road transport is constantly increasing Quebec&#39;s GHG emissions record for lack of real measures to reduce emissions in this sector, ”added Scott McKay.
“Nothing about the federal government either, which weighs down that of Quebec year after year. Canada&#39;s lack of effort in the fight against climate change casts a shadow over Quebec and places us at odds internationally, ”said the member for L&#39;Assomption.
“Mr. Arcand&#39;s speech contains important omissions. As always, the Liberal government is trying to paint its image with fine environmental principles. Behind the words, there is little concrete! The Liberals are once again reaffirming themselves the champions of greenwashing! », Concluded the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois.
