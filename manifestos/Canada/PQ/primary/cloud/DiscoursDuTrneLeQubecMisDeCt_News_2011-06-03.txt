Quebec - The MP for Marie-Victorin and official opposition critic for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Bernard Drainville, noted this afternoon that the Harper government will not only ignore Quebec&#39;s demands in the future, but in addition, it will do exactly the opposite of what Quebeckers want.
“The message in the Speech from the Throne is clear: Quebec no longer counts. Stephen Harper, now in the majority, leaves no room for doubt as to the importance he attaches to Quebec opinion. For him, Quebec is at the bottom of his priorities and this will be reflected in the unconstitutional reform of the Senate without Quebec&#39;s consent and by a significant reduction in Quebec&#39;s weight in the House of Commons, ”said Bernard Drainville.
“The Speech from the Throne includes several examples where the values of Quebecers are opposed to those of the Conservative government. Quebeckers have always been in favor of maintaining the gun registry and the Canadian government is preparing to abolish it. There is a strong consensus in Quebec against the creation of a Canadian securities commission, but Stephen Harper is moving forward anyway. Quebec refuses federal aid to be granted to Newfoundland for the Lower Churchill hydroelectric project and the Conservatives are announcing that they will go ahead even if this creates unfair competition for Hydro-Quebec. The American-style “law and order” model is miles from Quebec values, but it is more than ever the doctrine of the federal government, ”summed up the deputy.
&quot;Stephen Harper&#39;s majority government makes us realize more than ever that an independent Quebec would have the freedom to choose its priorities according to its values rather than having them imposed by the government of another nation,&quot; concluded Bernard Drainville.
