Quebec - The member for Drummond and official opposition spokesperson for language, Yves-François Blanchet, is worried about the repeated refusal of the minister responsible for the application of the Charter of the French language, Christine St- Pierre, and the Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF) to apply the billing law. He vehemently denounces the cost of another OQLF awareness campaign among businesses in order to encourage them to take note of the law on posting and formulating corporate names.
“This campaign, costing $ 500,000, is laughable. It is a lot of money to tell people that respecting the law in Quebec is a choice. Businesses don&#39;t have a lot of respect for Bill 101 simply because the current government doesn&#39;t either. Rather than sanctioning, we are going to subsidize companies that agree to francize their signage. It is a flagrant lack of respect for our language, ”denounced the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois.
According to MP Yves-François Blanchet, “there are neighborhoods in Montreal and now suburbs where unilingual English signage is practiced in small businesses. It&#39;s not just the big chains that protect their trademarks and see no reason to francize them. In shopping centers, the majority of businesses are in violation of the law. What does the Minister give to the OQLF as resources? It authorizes the right to write checks to offenders who comply rather than impose fines provided for by law, ”he protested.
“Thirty-four years later, Act 101 has been so attacked that it can no longer be repaired; it must be rewritten. This is not a task for wizard apprentices who postpone national struggles out of opportunism. This is the mandate of the government of a nation. Only the Parti Québécois is committed to restoring French to its status as an official, common and national language, ”concluded the member for Drummond.
