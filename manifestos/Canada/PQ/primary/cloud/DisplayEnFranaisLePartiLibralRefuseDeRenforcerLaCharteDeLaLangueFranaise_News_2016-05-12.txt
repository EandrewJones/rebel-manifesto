Quebec - The member for Bourget and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois responsible for the Charter of the French language, Maka Kotto, denounced the unacceptable setbacks made by the Liberal government in terms of the language of signage.
“For the past year, we have been tirelessly asking the government to close the legal breach that opened with the judgment of the Court of Appeal. For us, this involves amending the Charter of the French language, as recommended by the judge. This modification must stipulate that a generic or a description in French must accompany the display of a trademark in another language. This was the government&#39;s position before the judgment. However, last week, it rather decided to intervene by regulatory means, which in itself constitutes a weaker response than if it had chosen the legislative route ”, indicated Maka Kotto.
Basically, the government&#39;s plan confirms the breach rather than filling it, since it offers immense latitude of interpretation by authorizing “any other term or mention” rather than a generic or a description. “The government has clearly made the choice to go short of what its position was before the judgment. This is an unacceptable first step backwards. Then, by introducing the concept of &quot;sufficient presence of French&quot;, the government opens a new breach and undermines the concept of the predominance of French in public signage. This is an unacceptable second setback, ”continued the member for Bourget.
“The government must finally admit that beyond the language of display, French is under pressure in several respects in Quebec, and that it is urgent to show voluntarism. By rejecting our motion, which nevertheless has a consensus among the opposition parties, the liberal government of Philippe Couillard rejects our outstretched hand and, in the face of history, stands out as the one that will have pushed back our official language ”, a concluded Maka Kotto.
