Trois-Rivières - The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, today announced the candidacy of Djemila Benhabib in the riding of Trois-Rivières.
“Djemila is an exceptional woman who chose Quebec because it is a land of welcome, freedom and equality. She is a courageous activist who does not know the language of the woods and does not fear going up to the barricades. A woman of great sensitivity who will know how to become a passionate Member of Parliament, listening to her fellow citizens. Djemila Benhabib is joining us because she shares our vision of Quebec values, ”said Pauline Marois.
“If I am joining the Parti Québécois team today, it is first and foremost because it is the only party that is not afraid to assert and defend Quebec values. The secularism of institutions, equality between women and men and respect for the Quebec identity are important issues for me and I will take them with pride to the citizens of Trois-Rivières, ”exclaimed Djemila Benhabib. .
Pauline Marois reiterated that the Parti Québécois believed in a Quebec proud of its values, its language, its traditions and equality between women and men. “We appreciate the diversity that enriches Quebec, but we reject Canadian multiculturalism. For us, the integration of cultural communities into Quebec society is essential and multiculturalism is a major obstacle to harmonious integration, ”said the leader of the Parti Québécois.
&quot;I am confident that the citizens of Mauricie and Trois-Rivières will choose a Quebec that stands up and is not afraid to assert its values,&quot; concluded Pauline Marois, recalling that the Party Québécois is the largest political formation in Quebec with its 90,000 members.
