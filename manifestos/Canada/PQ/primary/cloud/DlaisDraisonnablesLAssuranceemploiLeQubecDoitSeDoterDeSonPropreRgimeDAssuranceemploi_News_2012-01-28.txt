Montreal - While many Quebecers are paying the price for unreasonable delays in processing claims for employment insurance benefits, the Parti Québécois reiterates that it is important for Quebec to have its own employment insurance program in order to &#39;&#39; offer a plan better suited to the reality of Quebec.
For the member for Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for employment and social solidarity, Dave Turcotte, the recent setbacks of the federal system show us once again that the Government of Canada is not in able to provide social programs.
“It is unacceptable that unemployed people have to wait 45 days to get their first employment insurance check when the usual delay is more than two weeks. This is one more reason for Quebec to adopt its own employment insurance plan. It is essential that employment insurance return to what it should always have been, that is, real insurance that helps workers when they need it, ”said Dave Turcotte.
In November 2011, the leader of the official opposition, Pauline Marois, invited representatives of all political parties, both in Quebec City and in Ottawa, to unite around this winning idea for Quebec and to demand a same voice the repatriation of the employment insurance plan.
“While 51,000 jobs were lost in Quebec in 2011 and the unemployment rate reached 8.7% last December, it is necessary to develop our own system which will become a solution to the labor shortage. specialized work. The Parti Québécois wants a system that would allow employers and workers to emerge as winners for the benefit of all of Quebec society, ”concluded the member for Marie-Victorin and spokesperson for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Bernard Drainville.
