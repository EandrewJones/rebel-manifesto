Quebec - Following the announcement of the upcoming dismantling of the terminal at Montreal-Mirabel International Airport, the members of the Parti Québécois from the Laurentides region, Sylvain Pagé, Pierre Karl Péladeau and Claude Cousineau, wish to ensure their support for the population of Mirabel and the entire region. They appeal to the government to intervene immediately in this matter.
“The government must respond to the mobilization underway in the Laurentians and throughout the greater Montreal region. The terminal represents major development potential; we support the population and elected officials so that we can avoid its demolition, ”declared the member for Labelle, Sylvain Pagé.
The call for mobilization launched by the mayor of Mirabel, Mr. Jean Bouchard, was heard in particular by the elected representatives of the Regional Conference of Elected Officials of the Laurentians and the Montreal Metropolitan Community. All agree to work together to find solutions.
The deputies are also asking the government to participate in defining a new vocation for the terminal, with an area of 500,000 square feet, unoccupied since 2004.
“The government cannot remain inactive on this file. Mirabel Airport is a hub for the aeronautics sector in Quebec. Its terminal can be at the heart of continued development and revitalization, on condition that it finds a new vocation, ”underlined the member for Bertrand, Claude Cousineau.
“The community and municipal officials know that they can count on our collaboration to find an innovative and structuring project for the benefit of the entire population. Before proceeding with the dismantling, we must give ourselves the time necessary to analyze all the possibilities, as requested by all the stakeholders, ”concluded the Member of Parliament for Saint-Jérôme, Pierre Karl Péladeau.
