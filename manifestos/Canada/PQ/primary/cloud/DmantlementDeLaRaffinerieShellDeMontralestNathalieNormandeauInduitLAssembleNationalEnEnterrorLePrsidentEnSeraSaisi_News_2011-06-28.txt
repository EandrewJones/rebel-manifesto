Montreal - The MP for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for the Metropolis, Nicole Léger, this afternoon sent a letter denouncing a violation of rights and privileges to the President of the National Assembly , Mr. Jacques Chagnon.
On at least three times during question period during the past year, Minister Normandeau said, hand on heart, that she would not issue a decommissioning permit for the Shell refinery in Montreal-East before the filing of the report resulting from the mandate of the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries, Energy and Natural Resources on the security of supplies of petroleum products.
“The Minister reiterated that she would never disrespect the work of parliamentarians and that she would never render a decision or issue a dismantling permit before the end of the mandate of initiative. However, the work is not completed, the members of the commission have not submitted their report and the minister is now acting by doing exactly the opposite of what she said. There is a breach of the ethics of a parliamentarian, ”Nicole Léger stressed with discontent.
“Nathalie Normandeau&#39;s attitude is unworthy of her duties,” added the MP. A minister cannot say one thing and do exactly the opposite as soon as the parliamentary session ends. The Minister&#39;s attitude makes a mockery of the House and the work of its members and violates the rights of its members, as previously recognized by case law ”.
“The president has in front of him all the elements to make an informed decision. The Minister must change her attitude and respect the institutions, ”concluded the Member for Pointe-aux-Trembles.
