Quebec - The Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, and the Minister of International Relations, La Francophonie and Foreign Trade and Minister responsible for the Montreal region, Mr. Jean-François Lisée consider that Mr. Applebaum made the necessary decision.
&quot;For my part, I am committed to working in concert with the representatives of the City of Montreal so that the latter regains stability and I will not hesitate, if necessary, to support Montreal to ensure its proper functioning&quot;, declared Minister Gaudreault. On November 3, the citizens of Montreal will democratically elect a mayor as well as the members who will form the municipal council. &quot;For the moment, I invite the elected representatives of the City of Montreal to quickly designate the person who will act as interim so that the management of the metropolis of Quebec can resume its normal course,&quot; added Minister Lisée.
It should be remembered that the councilors must, within 30 days of the notice of the vacancy of the post of mayor, elect one of them to this post. The election is made by secret ballot during a council meeting. The nomination and voting procedure will be established by the Clerk.
