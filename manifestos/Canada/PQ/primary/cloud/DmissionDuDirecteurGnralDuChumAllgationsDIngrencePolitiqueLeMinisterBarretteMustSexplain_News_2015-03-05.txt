Quebec - The MNA for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for ethics and integrity, Stéphane Bergeron, and the MNA for Taillon and spokesperson for health and access to care, Diane Lamarre , ask the Minister of Health to explain himself in the case of the resignation of the Director General of the Center hospitalier de l&#39;Université de Montréal (CHUM), Jacques Turgeon.
“The minister is accused of having demonstrated political interference and abuse of power by imposing his choice for the appointment of the director of the CHUM&#39;s surgical department, who would be a good friend of his. This is a serious, very serious accusation, to which is added the appearance of a conflict of interest, ”declared Stéphane Bergeron.
“The Minister held a press briefing this noon to justify the resignation of the Director General of the CHUM and to clear himself of any link with this story. Why is it the Minister, and not the CHUM, who announced this news to us this morning? What message does this send to the health network, which is currently in turmoil because of the reform imposed by the minister and, above all, at the heart of a process for appointing its CEOs? The Minister must explain his actions and his links with the head of the CHUM&#39;s surgical department, ”concluded Diane Lamarre.
