Quebec - The Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, takes note of the resignation of the mayor of Ville de Laval, Mr. Alexandre Duplessis.
&quot;Going forward, I hope that the position of mayor will be filled quickly in order to maintain the provision of services to citizens between now and the next municipal elections,&quot; said Minister Gaudreault.
The Act respecting elections and referendums in municipalities provides that when the vacancy of the post of mayor is noted in the 12 months preceding the day fixed for the poll of the next general election and the council has not decreed that it must be filled by a by-election, the councilors must, within 30 days of the notice of the vacancy, elect one of them to that office.
Remember that the City of Laval has been under supervision since June 3, 2013. As an independent administrative body, the Commission municipale du Qu√©bec approves or not the decisions taken by the municipal council of the municipality under supervision. Note, however, that the guardians do not have to decide on the choice of the new mayor.
