Quebec - The member for Marie-Victorin and official opposition spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, demanded from the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Pierre Arcand, answers regarding the numerous resignations at Hydro-Québec.
“It can no longer be coincidence. Crown corporation numbers 1 and 2 have resigned, as has the head of smart meters. We learn today that one of the oldest members of the board of directors, Michel Plessis-Bélair, has also left his post under unclear circumstances. Minister Pierre Arcand must be transparent with Quebeckers. What is happening at Hydro-Québec? Have these people refused to blindly follow the new government directions? Is this related to the privatization proposed in the Montmarquette report? Stop talking to us about coincidences; there is no longer anyone who believes that this situation is due to chance. The minister must give answers, ”said Bernard Drainville.
In 10 years, 27 internal investigations
“During the study of budget appropriations last June, I asked the Minister if there had been any internal investigations into the awarding of Hydro-Québec contracts. In September 2014, we got the answer: since 2005, there have been 27 internal investigations into contracts awarded by Hydro-Québec. What contracts have these investigations covered? What sites? Which companies? For which alleged irregularities? We do not know. Hydro-Quebec refused to reveal the content of the reports, ”added the spokesperson.
Bernard Drainville also called on Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, who said last week that everything was fine and that departures were normal in a large company. “Unlike the Prime Minister, we don&#39;t think it&#39;s trivial. Quebeckers want explanations. Hydro-Quebec is theirs. Those who resign must be heard in parliamentary committee; we want to know their version of the facts, ”he concluded.
