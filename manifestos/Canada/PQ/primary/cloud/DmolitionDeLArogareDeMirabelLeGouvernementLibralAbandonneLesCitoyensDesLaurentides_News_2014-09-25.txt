Quebec - The member for Labelle, Sylvain Pagé, denounces the total abandonment of the Liberal government and the minister responsible for the Laurentides region, Pierre Arcand, in the Mirabel terminal issue. This morning, he held a press briefing on this subject, along with the MP for Mirabel, Sylvie D&#39;Amours, and the mayor of Mirabel, Jean Bouchard.
“In response to my questions, Minister Arcand totally despised the regional consensus asking Aéroports de Montréal (ADM) for an additional three months before proceeding with the destruction of the terminal. Elected officials, the CRÉ and the Montreal Metropolitan Community are unanimous on this subject. The Liberals are confirming today that they are abandoning the citizens of the Laurentians, ”declared Sylvain Pagé.
The idea of converting the abandoned terminal into a trade fair center represents a major economic project and, according to the preliminary business plan, the region has the potential to ensure its viability. The partners are putting together a proposal to reuse the terminal facilities; a management company has been formed, projects are in the works, but it takes a little time.
“Despite the unacceptable decisions and the human tragedies caused by Mirabel&#39;s horror story, the people of the region look to the future with resilience and courage. The three-month deadline would allow Mirabel to study the viability of the exhibition center project. However, the government is brushing aside the regional approach with the back of the hand; it is incomprehensible and unacceptable, ”concluded Sylvain Pagé.
