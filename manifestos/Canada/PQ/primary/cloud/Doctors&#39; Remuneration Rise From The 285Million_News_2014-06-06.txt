Quebec - The member for Richelieu and official opposition spokesperson for the Conseil du trésor, Élaine Zakaïb, asks the president of the Conseil du trésor, Martin Coiteux, to tell Quebecers where the amount of 285 million associated with an increase in the remuneration of physicians included in the expenditure budget that he tabled on Wednesday.
“The president of the Federation of Specialist Physicians of Quebec said she had never seen this figure. What about the transparency promised by the government? The President of the Conseil du trésor has refused to answer my question three times. There is an amount in a budget - a very important document on which parliamentarians are called to vote - and no one knows what it is, ”declared Élaine Zakaïb.
The Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, and the Minister of Health and Social Services, Gaétan Barrette, had given themselves until last Friday to reach an agreement, even going so far as to refer to a special law. Obviously, they failed. Minister Barrette is proving day after day that he is not the right person to lead the discussions. These negotiations with doctors are essential to the credibility of the budget and the liberal financial framework, as the rating agencies already have their eyes on the government.
“Obviously, the government is in total improvisation. Will the President of the Conseil du trésor take charge of the negotiations to reach an agreement, instead of inserting hypothetical figures in his appropriations? These negotiations are important: every dollar saved as part of this agreement will go to patient care in Quebec, ”concluded the spokesperson.
