Quebec - Premier of Quebec and leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, is pleased to announce that Dominique Payette will represent the Parti Québécois in the riding of Charlesbourg in the next general election.
“Dominique Payette has vast experience, which makes her a candidate who has a deep knowledge of the Quebec people. As early as the 1970s, she made her mark in the journalistic world, when it was not yet a traditional profession for women. She stood out for her rigor, her curiosity and her passion, qualities that will undoubtedly be welcome with us. &quot;
Professor at Laval University in information and communication, Dominique Payette is the daughter of the former minister of the Parti Québécois Lise Payette. Working as a journalist for many years, she has notably held the helm of the programs Present at Listening, À toi l&#39;Afrique, as well as 275-AllôetAdos-Radio. She has also been the mayor of the town of Lac Delage since 2013.
“We must absolutely fight against cynicism towards the political class. The best way to do this is to make a heartfelt commitment to serving the people. This is what I want to do, with all the integrity that this function requires, ”declared Dominique Payette.
Pauline Marois said she was excited about the interest shown by many people for the Parti Québécois team and believes that Quebeckers will be too. “The people who join our team are not only remarkable for the qualities they possess, but also for their unwavering attachment to Quebec. &quot;
The Prime Minister also took advantage of the inauguration of Dominique Payette to recall the achievements of her government. “Since taking office, we have set to work to restore control of their prosperity to Quebeckers. We have cleaned up by adopting Law 1 on the awarding of public contracts. We have taken care of our world by creating 15,000 places in early childhood centers and by giving priority to home care ”, underlined Pauline Marois.
