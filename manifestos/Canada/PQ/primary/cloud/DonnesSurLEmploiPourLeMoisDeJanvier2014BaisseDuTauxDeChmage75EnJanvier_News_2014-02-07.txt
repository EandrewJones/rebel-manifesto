Quebec– The most recent employment data, released this morning by Statistics Canada, is part of a relatively positive trend noted in Quebec in recent months. Indeed, the unemployment rate improved by 0.2 percentage point in January compared to December 2013 to stand at 7.5%. In addition, the employment rate increased slightly, bringing it to 60.4%. The level of employment is still among the best ever.
“Last month, 11,900 Quebecers who were unemployed found work. As a result, the labor market saw a gain of 12,700 jobs in January. In this regard, I see that the number of full-time jobs is stable. It should also be noted that the finance, insurance, real estate and rental sectors are starting the year on a good note with an increase of 14,600 jobs, ”said the Minister of Employment and Social solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Ms. Agnès Maltais.
“Our government&#39;s priority is jobs. All of our action revolves around the Priorité emploi economic policy, which aims to support projects that create jobs and wealth in all regions of Quebec. Over the next three years, it will create an additional 43,500 jobs, for a total of 115,000. Investing in jobs means investing in Quebec ”, declared the Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau.
The Ministère de l&#39;Emploi et de la Solidarité sociale, through Emploi-Québec, acts as a producer, user and distributor of national and regional labor market data. In particular, it produces the Bulletin sur le marché du travail au Québec, which reports monthly on changes in employment, the active population and unemployment in addition to listing information by region, by sector of activity and by occupation, as well as comparisons with Canada and Ontario.
