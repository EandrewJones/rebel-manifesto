Quebec– The most recent employment data, released this morning by Statistics Canada, show that the change in employment in Quebec follows the Canadian trend for July, with a decrease. The unemployment rate in Quebec is 8.2%.
However, it should be noted that between July 2012 and July 2013, employment increased by 1.2%, an increase comparable to the Canadian average. In the first seven months of the year, employment increased by 70,400, of which 57,400 were full-time compared to the same period for 2012.
“In Quebec, the employment and activity rates of the population aged 15 to 64 remain higher than the previous annual peaks observed. The medium and long-term outlook remains positive as it is expected that 700,000 jobs will be filled by 2016. This is why the Government of Quebec is working tirelessly to support people who wish to enter the labor market ”, indicated the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Ms. Agnès Maltais. In the census metropolitan area (CMA) of Montreal, the employment situation has been maintained. Over the past 12 months, 62,100 jobs have been created there and the unemployment rate has changed little, standing at 8.3%.
The Ministère de l&#39;Emploi et de la Solidarité sociale, through Emploi-Québec, acts as a producer, user and distributor of national and regional labor market data. In particular, it produces the Bulletin sur le marché du travail au Québec, which reports monthly on changes in employment, the active population and unemployment in addition to listing information by region, sector of activity and profession, as well as comparisons with Canada and Ontario. This will be available at the end of the day on the Emploi-Québec website at the following address: www.emploiquebec.gouv.qc.ca/imt/emploi-au-quebec.asp.
