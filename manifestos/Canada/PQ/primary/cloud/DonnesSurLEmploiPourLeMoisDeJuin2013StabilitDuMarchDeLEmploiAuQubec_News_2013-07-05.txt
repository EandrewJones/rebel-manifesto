Quebec– According to the most recent employment data, released this morning by Statistics Canada, the employment situation in Quebec has seen little change. Despite a slight loss of 8,400 jobs in June, it should be noted that from January to June 2013, employment increased by 74,400, including a gain of 69,000 full-time jobs, compared to the same semester last year. Taking into account the annual variations, Québec posts a total of 48,000 more jobs than in June 2012.
Like Ontario, the unemployment rate edged up 0.2 percentage points to 7.9%. The labor force also held steady in June and increased by 63,900 people compared to June 2012.
“At 78.6%, the participation rate among 15 to 64 year olds has reached an all-time high. In addition, employment prospects are favorable. It is expected that nearly 700,000 jobs will be filled in Quebec between 2012 and 2016. It is for these reasons that the Quebec government is taking the necessary actions to help people who want to enter the labor market ”, indicated the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Ms. Agnès Maltais.
The Montreal census metropolitan area (CMA) saw the creation of 6,200 jobs in the past month and the unemployment rate remained stable at 8.2%. From January to June 2013, employment increased by 66,200, compared to the same period in 2012.
The Ministère de l&#39;Emploi et de la Solidarité sociale, through Emploi-Québec, acts as a producer, user and distributor of national and regional labor market data. In particular, it produces the Bulletin sur le marché du travail au Québec, which reports monthly on changes in employment, the active population and unemployment in addition to listing information by region, by sector of activity and by occupation, as well as comparisons with Canada and Ontario. This will be available at the end of the day on the Emploi-Québec website at the following address: www.emploiquebec.gouv.qc.ca/imt/emploi-au-quebec.asp.
