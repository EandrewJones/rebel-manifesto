Quebec - MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for families, Carole Poirier, said she was disappointed by the federal government&#39;s intransigence in the treatment accorded to the Castillo family, who were expelled yesterday. “We worked with this family so that at least the children could finish their school year before they had to leave the country. Unfortunately, the federal government has shown no flexibility, ”said the MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
For his part, the deputy for Deux-Montagnes and spokesperson for immigration, Benoit Charette, asks Minister Weil to ensure with his federal counterpart that the Castillo family file is reviewed. . &quot;Minister Weil must closely monitor this file so that this family, already well integrated into Quebec life, can return to Quebec as soon as possible,&quot; asked the immigration spokesperson.
“The Castillo family left Quebec today with the firm intention of returning. Staff at my constituency office have provided family members with all the necessary documents to complete an Application for Quebec Selection Certificate, which they must do as soon as they settle in Mexico in a location that will hopefully be the, will be safe for them. They will confirm the timing of their application so that we can follow up with Ms. Weil&#39;s ministry. We hope that this file will be treated with the greatest diligence, ”concluded Carole Poirier.
