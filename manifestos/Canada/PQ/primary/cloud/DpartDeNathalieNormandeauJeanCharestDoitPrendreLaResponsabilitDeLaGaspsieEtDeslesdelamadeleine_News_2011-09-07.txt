Quebec - The MP for Charlevoix and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pauline Marois, and the MP for Matane, Pascal Bérubé, ask the Premier of Quebec, Jean Charest, to take responsibility for Gaspésie and the Îles-de-la -Madeleine.
“The departure of Nathalie Normandeau creates a great void in eastern Quebec. The Gaspésie and Îles-de-la-Madeleine region, which is going through a period of socio-economic turbulence, needs a strong minister in the Council of Ministers; Jean Charest must therefore occupy this important function for the region, ”said Pauline Marois.
The member for Matane recalled that, under the leadership of the Parti Québécois, it was the Premier of Quebec who held the presidency of the government revival committee and that Pauline Marois made the commitment, in the 2008 election, to hold the post of minister responsible for the region.
What is more, between 2007 and 2008, Jean Charest took on the responsibility of Minister responsible for the Capitale-Nationale. “If it&#39;s good for the Quebec City region, why wouldn&#39;t it be good for the Gaspé? This is more than a symbolic gesture: our region still requires special attention from government authorities and, in the current state of affairs, it is only the Prime Minister who can live up to regional expectations. », Concluded Pascal Bérubé.
