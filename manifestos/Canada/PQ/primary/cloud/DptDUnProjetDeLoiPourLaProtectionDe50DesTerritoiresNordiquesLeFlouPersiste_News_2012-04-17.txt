Quebec - Reacting to the tabling of Bill 65 on the conservation of natural heritage and on the sustainable development of the territory of the marketing plan for the North, the Member for L&#39;Assomption and official opposition critic for the environment, of sustainable development and parks, Scott McKay, believes that this is a cosmetic environmental protection. In addition, this bill maintains the vagueness of the real repercussions and consequences.
“Once again, the Liberal government has created huge expectations which are slowly declining. It is sad that the bill maintains the vagueness and fuels confusion as to the real intentions of environmental protection projected by the marketing plan of the North ”, indicated Scott McKay.
The member notes that the bill does not correct the absence of significant commitments for the environmental protection of the northern territories in the last budget presented a few weeks ago.
“The conservation and protection of northern territories are necessary and desired, but we still need to have the means and involve the northern communities who live and inhabit the territory. These communities are the best equipped to work actively to protect 50% of their living environment. The current process ignores their expertise, ”concluded Scott McKay.
