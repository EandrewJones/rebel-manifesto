Quebec - The member for Rousseau and official opposition critic for finance and revenue, Nicolas Marceau, today tabled a petition signed by more than 46,000 Quebecers who are asking, as part of the bill 28, that pharmacists retain the resources necessary to maintain the services they offer.
“The government has decided to cut direct patient services. However, pharmacists are among the most accessible health professionals; their establishments are open every day, and often until late at night. The government must listen to what pharmacists have to offer and not impose measures on them through its “little mammoth” bill, ”declared Nicolas Marceau.
Bill 28 also reduces the sums granted by the government to pharmacists for an important measure of home support: the preparation of pill dispensers. This service mainly benefits seniors, already vulnerable people who want to stay at home as long as possible. To do this, pill organizers are essential tools.
“The day before the bill was tabled, the government was still negotiating with pharmacists. It is not being fair to bypass the process so quickly. The government &quot;bulldozed&quot; the negotiations by imposing its cuts and the working conditions of pharmacists in Bill 28 on the budget. This way of operating is worthy of the Conservatives in Ottawa; it is certainly not a source of pride, ”added the member for Rousseau.
“Today we are tabling a petition with more than 46,000 names; I hope that the government will listen to these Quebeckers, and that it will negotiate in good faith with pharmacists, instead of imposing conditions on them. Our goal remains to ensure the best possible access for citizens to health services, ”concluded Nicolas Marceau.
