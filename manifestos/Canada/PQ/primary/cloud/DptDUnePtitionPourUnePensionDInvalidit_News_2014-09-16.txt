Quebec - The member for Rimouski and official opposition spokesperson for the fight against poverty, solidarity and social economy, Harold LeBel, today tabled in the National Assembly a petition from the Collectif for a disability pension. The head and founder of the Collective, Ms. Carole St-Laurent, is proud of the 7,123 electronic signatures and some 1,000 paper signatures obtained in favor of the granting of a disability pension for all people genuinely unfit for employment. .
According to Ms. St-Laurent, the current system, in place for over forty years, is no longer appropriate; people receiving benefits are deprived of any chance to improve their condition. &quot;The rules in force do not allow us to live as a couple, to have more than $ 1,500 in savings or to save for our old age without being cut off,&quot; she says.
In the eyes of the member for Rimouski, Harold LeBel, this situation must be corrected, which deprives these people of the rights that all other citizens of Quebec have. “Their condition of unfitness for work is real and permanent. This in itself is a difficult situation. Should we also prevent them from making choices that would allow them to improve their condition and think about their future? The current system pushes them towards isolation; it is totally absurd and unfair, ”he said.
According to the deputy, this is a blatant case of social exclusion. “In 2004, the government adopted a law to fight poverty and social exclusion. Obviously, the targets we set for ourselves ten years ago have not all been achieved. We should review this law, take stock of it, define new objectives and continue to work for the good of all, ”concluded Harold LeBel.
