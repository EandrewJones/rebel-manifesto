Québec, September 29, 2016 - The member for Sanguinet and Parti Québécois spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, asks the Prime Minister to reverse his decision, and the Liberal government to take the result into account public consultations and accept the motion to split Bill 106 that he tabled this afternoon in the National Assembly. “We talk a lot about social acceptability in the hydrocarbons file. Well, our split motion has it, this social acceptability, ”he said.
“The chapter on hydrocarbons contained in Bill 106 has only generated concerns; the government must listen to reason and withdraw it. The heart of Bill 106 is Quebec&#39;s transition to clean energy. It is therefore completely contradictory to include a mini-bill on hydrocarbons! It is essential to separate the two issues. The issue of hydrocarbons is particularly complex and deserves a debate in itself, ”then insisted the member for Sanguinet.
“The debate on Bill 106 will resume next Tuesday. I therefore extend my hand to the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Pierre Arcand: if he convinces his Prime Minister to accept the split, we will be able to make rapid progress with the first chapters directly concerning the energy transition, an issue that consensus in Quebec. Regarding hydrocarbons, the Minister must listen to the concerns of Quebecers, take them into account, and accept our proposal, which has the support of many stakeholders in the agricultural, environmental, legal and municipal sectors, as well as that of the two other opposition parties. », Concluded Alain Therrien.
