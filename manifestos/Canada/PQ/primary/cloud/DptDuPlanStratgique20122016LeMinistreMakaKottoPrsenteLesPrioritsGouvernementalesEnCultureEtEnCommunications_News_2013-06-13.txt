Quebec - The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, is pleased to announce the tabling of the 2012-2016 strategic plan of the Ministry of Culture and Communications to the National Assembly.
“This strategic plan clearly demonstrates the desire of the Government of Quebec to fully assume its cultural skills and to support the influence of Quebec creativity at home and beyond our borders. Because culture defines us as a people, it is essential to create conditions favorable to the development of a strong cultural footprint for Quebec, ”Minister Kotto said.
The Quebec government affirms in this plan its desire to be the prime contractor for the development of its culture by negotiating the repatriation of the federal government&#39;s cultural budgets, by the priority given to creation, production and distribution. , by updating the cultural policy of 1992 as well as by developing a strategy for digital cultural content.

To do this, the Ministry proposes to step up actions to bring young people and culture closer together, optimize local and regional partnerships and promote access to and dissemination of culture by as many people as possible. In addition, the Department intends to make all the necessary efforts to ensure the influence of Quebec culture internationally.
