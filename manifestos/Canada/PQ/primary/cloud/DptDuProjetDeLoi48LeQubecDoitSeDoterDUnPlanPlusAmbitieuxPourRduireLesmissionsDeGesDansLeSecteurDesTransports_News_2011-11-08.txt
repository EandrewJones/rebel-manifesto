Quebec - The member for L&#39;Assomption and official opposition critic for the environment, sustainable development and parks, Scott McKay, welcomes with interest and skepticism the tabling of Bill 48 concerning environmental inspection motor vehicles.
“We have been calling for it for a long time and we reiterated it again at our congress last April; Québec must adopt an ambitious plan to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. With an increase of 30% between 1990 and 2008, action must be taken. However, this bill alone will be insufficient. We must go further, ”said the member for L&#39;Assomption.
Scott McKay recalls that the Parti Québécois has outlined an ambitious plan to accelerate the achievement of significant reduction targets for Quebec by proposing in particular to develop poles of excellence in the advanced transport sector, by proceeding with electrification. public and commercial fleets of vehicles and by promoting, with massive investments, public transport systems.
“Bill 48 is a step in the right direction, but we invite the Liberal government to be more daring and we intend to take this opportunity for Quebec to take one more step. It is all the more important with the aberrant, scandalous and unacceptable decision of the Harper government to withdraw from the Kyoto protocol. In doing so, Quebec has also just withdrawn, being still dependent on federal decisions, ”added the Member for L&#39;Assomption.
“In addition, we have to wonder about the moment when the government chose to introduce the bill, a few hours before the end of the work of the parliamentary session. Above all, it masks the government&#39;s inertia in reducing emissions in the transport sector, ”concluded Scott McKay.
