Quebec - The MNA for Taschereau and official opposition spokesperson for the Capitale-Nationale, Agnès Maltais, tabled today in the National Assembly, at the request of the mayor of Quebec City, Mr. Régis Labeaume , private bill 204 concerning the multifunctional amphitheater project in Quebec.
This bill recognizes the specific nature of the approach taken by the City of Quebec for the management of the future amphitheater. However, according to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, this approach, according to case law, could be considered as a competition and therefore, respect the spirit of the law.
“The City of Quebec wishes to protect and secure its agreement reached with Quebecor, after having solicited other offers. It is a very fair decision. Thus, with this bill, we want to go further and put all the chances on our side for the return of a National Hockey League (LNH) team to Quebec. Those who would like to challenge the agreement will have to know that it will be based on even more solid legal foundations, ”said Agnès Maltais.
The member for Taschereau now wants the debate to be held calmly and where it is relevant to do so at this stage, that is, in a parliamentary committee. &quot;People who wish to be heard can be heard and parliamentarians and the population will then be able to form an enlightened opinion,&quot; she continued.
“Let&#39;s not lose sight of the essential: we must unite our efforts to realize the dream of many citizens of Quebec and Quebec, namely the return of an NHL team to Quebec. It is our dearest wish. Anyone who opposes the adoption of this bill risks slowing the realization of this dream, ”concluded Agnès Maltais.
