Quebec - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of education, research and academic perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, proposes to extend the powers of the Auditor General (VG) to all universities in Quebec, in order to end to the waste of public funds in the higher education network.
This morning, the member for Lac-Saint-Jean tabled Bill 590 in the National Assembly, which extends the powers of the VG to so-called “chartered” universities. Currently, only the institutions of the Université du Québec (UQ) network are subject to it.
“The scandals of mismanagement of public funds have been piling up for years. It&#39;s time to put an end to the open bar in our universities. The Quebec government pays more than $ 2 billion a year to so-called &quot;chartered&quot; universities. No other entity receiving such sums from the State escapes the verifications of the VG. Nothing justifies the current differential treatment between UQ establishments and other universities, ”said Alexandre Cloutier.
The recent revelations of the Auditor General, according to which hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses have been illegally paid to executives of the institutions of the University of Quebec network, testify to the importance of an independent look at the administration. universities, according to the Parti Québécois.
“More than $ 1.2 million from taxpayers&#39; pockets has been illegally paid into just 5 institutions. The government must recover these sums and ensure that we can know the state of the situation in the other universities. While our higher education network suffers from underfunding, we must give ourselves all the means to prevent such large sums from being squandered without the knowledge of the population, ”added Alexandre Cloutier.
