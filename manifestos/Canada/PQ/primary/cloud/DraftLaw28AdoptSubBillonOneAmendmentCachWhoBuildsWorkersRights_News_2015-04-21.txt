Quebec - The member for Sanguinet and official opposition spokesperson for labor, Alain Therrien, denounces the fact that the Liberal government has made an amendment to Bill 28, adopted under gag order, which flouts article 45 of the Labor Code and affects workers in CLDs.
Indeed, buried in 148 pages of amendments, the government, in the wake of the abolition of CLDs, forced the adoption of article 255.12, which stipulates that “[a] no employment contract, no accreditation or collective agreement within the meaning of the Labor Code binding a CLD does not bind a regional county municipality ”.
“In short, not only are CLD workers fired, but also those who will be rehired of their union credentials, their collective agreements, in short, their working conditions. All this materialized by amendment, during a gag order, therefore without any consultation. The government shows no respect for these workers who have contributed to Quebec&#39;s economic development. How could the Minister of Labor allow such a flagrant violation of section 45 of the Labor Code to pass? “Asked Alain Therrien.
The Member points out that the set of rules that apply when transferring employees is a contentious subject that has been the subject of several debates and has given rise to numerous clashes in Quebec. Today, the government is telling CLD employees that in their case, section 45 will not apply and that they will lose their accreditations, collective agreements and working conditions.
“After Bill 3, which broke duly negotiated employment contracts, the government is once again attacking workers in Quebec, and it did not even have the courage to meet with them. When will he stop his attacks on our workers? », Concluded Alain Therrien.
