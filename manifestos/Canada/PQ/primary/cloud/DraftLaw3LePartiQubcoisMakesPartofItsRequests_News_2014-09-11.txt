Quebec - The MNA for Taschereau and House Leader of the Official Opposition, Agnès Maltais, and the MNA for Sanguinet and spokesperson for work and pensions, Alain Therrien, presented demands to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Occupation of the Land, Pierre Moreau, in preparation for the clause-by-clause consideration of Bill 3, An Act to promote the financial health and sustainability of defined benefit pension plans in the municipal sector.
“We will make suggestions for amendments to the bill, in the best interests of workers, retirees, taxpayers and municipalities. The one-size-fits-all solution and automatism are not acceptable. We believe in the benefits of negotiation and respect for signed contracts, and it is in this sense that we will make proposals to the Minister, ”said Alain Therrien.
Following the parliamentary committee, here are the main findings of the official opposition:
Minister Moreau must commit
Agnès Maltais asks Minister Moreau to make a clear commitment before the adoption of the principle of the bill: that of tabling, before the start of the detailed study, the actuarial valuations of the pension plans as at December 31, 2013. She also asks the minister to forward to the official opposition the main amendments that he intends to table in the committee, always before the detailed study of the bill.
“It&#39;s a matter of respect for all parties involved. The up-to-date figures will allow us to do a rigorous job. Faced with such an important problem, it is essential to have the most accurate picture of the situation. The same goes for the amendments, ”concluded the parliamentary leader of the official opposition.
