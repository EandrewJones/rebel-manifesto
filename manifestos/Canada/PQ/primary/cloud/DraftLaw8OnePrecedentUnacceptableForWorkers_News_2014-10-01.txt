Quebec - The member for Berthier and official opposition critic for agriculture, fisheries and food, André Villeneuve, denounces the precedent created by the Liberals&#39; Bill 8 for the rights of Quebec workers.
The Liberal bill, which obtains the support of the CAQ, prohibits union certification in agricultural enterprises with two workers or less &quot;on an ordinary and continuous basis&quot;. However, many of these companies hire temporary workers by the hundreds. Thousands of them will therefore see their rights violated by the Liberal-CAQ bill.
&quot;We recognize the need for a specific labor law regime for certain agricultural enterprises, in particular for market gardeners and producers of small fruits whose harvest must be done within very short deadlines and for which a strike would have disproportionate consequences. . However, this diet must be balanced. Most of these farms are small family businesses. The Liberal Party&#39;s proposal, by prohibiting all certification rights to certain workers, represents an unacceptable precedent, ”declared André Villeneuve.
In contrast, the vision of the Parti Québécois government in the area of agriculture was particularly structuring; Let us recall, among other things, the adoption of the Food Sovereignty Policy, applauded almost unanimously by the agrifood industry in Quebec.
