Quebec - The MNA for Matapédia and official opposition spokesperson for social services, Danielle Doyer, this morning called on the Minister of Health and Social Services, Yves Bolduc, to set up a commission parliament whose main objective would be to counter family tragedies in Quebec.
The Parti Québécois is of the opinion that the holding of such a commission would make it possible to consult various stakeholders concerned by this issue, to assess the continuum of prevention services available at this time, particularly in mental health, and to reach a consensus that will lead to the implementation of various measures to promote adequate support for families and to put forward first-line prevention services to significantly reduce these family tragedies.
“There is reason to be devastated by the family tragedies that are shaking Quebec at the moment. The distress of many families is palpable and unfortunately, real human tragedies are occurring, tragedies which cannot leave Quebeckers indifferent, ”said the member during the question period. “Whether it&#39;s this mother who joined the Rivière des Prairies with her two children, three months and five years old in each arm; whether it concerns children found burnt in the car of a father; whether it is a father who is leading his two children to death as a result of marital problems, the government must recognize today that the increase in these tragedies, which have received high media coverage in recent months, requires let a debate take place, stop ignoring them and worry about finding adequate solutions, ”she continued.
“Minister Bolduc expressed encouraging openness to our request, but the Leader of the Government seemed more reluctant to hold a parliamentary commission on this subject. I ask the Minister of Health to urge his leader and his Prime Minister to give parliamentarians such a mandate without delay so that solutions can be found. It is our duty as elected officials to act quickly, ”continued Danielle Doyer.
&quot;The Parti Québécois is of the opinion that even if these questions are heavy, sensitive and delicate, elected officials must now take an interest in them in order to improve government actions which act mainly in terms of prevention&quot;, she concluded.
