Quebec - Following the announcement by the federal Minister of the Environment, who is suspending the project to discharge 8 billion liters of wastewater into the St. Lawrence River, the member for Terrebonne and spokesperson for the Party Quebecer in matters of sustainable development, the environment and the fight against climate change, Mathieu Traversy, deplores the fact that Quebec&#39;s Minister of the Environment, David Heurtel, is behind the Conservative government when it comes to protection. of the environment.
“We have been asking David Heurtel for two weeks to suspend the authorization given to the City of Montreal. We demanded that it be transparent by making public all the scientific opinions and all the impact studies supporting its decision. He only revealed a few documents and information in a trickle, ”said Mathieu Traversy.
The Couillard government has really shown incompetence and improvisation in this matter. “We know that the federal campaign is in full swing and that the Conservatives are very likely to act out of political opportunism. That said, it is up to the Quebec Minister of the Environment to take all appropriate measures to protect citizens and the environment. Once again, it is embarrassing to note that David Heurtel is passing off the Conservatives for defenders of the environment, ”added the deputy.
Let us recall that the Parti Québécois is demanding the resignation of David Heurtel from his post of Minister of the Environment since June 5, 2015.
