Quebec - The Ministère du Développement durable, de l&#39;Environnement, de la Faune et des Parcs provides an update on the situation in Sept-Îles following the major fuel oil spill at the Cliffs Natural Resources pelletizing plant (Cliffs) on September 1st.
The aerial overflight of September 11 revealed that only the boom sector confining the banks showed a trace of iridescence. However, the interveners continue to closely monitor the situation since the tides and variable weather conditions in the region mean that there is always a risk of release in the bay. In addition, two biologists from the Department are on site to gather the information necessary to produce an opinion on the best methods to be used to clean the salt marsh and eelgrass (herbarium).
The Department ensures that Cliffs is making all necessary efforts to quickly correct the situation. In addition, the recovery and cleaning of the banks are going well. The works are adapted according to the evolution of the situation. All measures are currently being implemented to recover as much of this contaminant as possible as quickly as possible.
Remember that the case was transferred to the Investigations Department of the Ministry for criminal prosecution.
