Quebec - The Minister responsible for Government Administration and Chairman of the Treasury Board, Mr. Stéphane Bédard, made public the report of the firm SECOR-KPMG on the management of additional expenses for the service and construction contracts of certain organizations public.
In March 2013, the government of Quebec mandated the firm SECOR-KPMG to shed light on the cost overruns of construction contracts and professional services of three large public bodies, namely the Ministry of Transport, the Société immobilière du Québec and the Quebec Shared Services Center.
The government will pay particular attention to the findings and recommendations of this report and act on them as soon as possible.
“Our government&#39;s action, in particular the adoption of Law No. 1 on integrity in public contracts and the tabling of the draft law on infrastructure governance, goes in the direction of honest and efficient management of public funds. We intend to continue our efforts in this direction to adopt the best contractual practices ”, concluded the Minister.
