Quebec - The Minister for Industrial Policy and the Quebec Economic Development Bank, Ms. Élaine Zakaïb, is embarking on a tour that will take her, over the coming weeks, to several regions of Quebec. Its first stop will be on Thursday, October 4, in Bonaventure, in the Gaspésie? Îles-de-la-Madeleine region.
“As soon as I arrived as Minister Delegate, it was essential for me to go and meet the main players in economic development in the field. Our territory is vast and the diverse realities experienced by entrepreneurs in each of our regions require special attention. I am convinced that the future of Quebec depends on the sustainable development of the regions. I need to hear and interact with business people. I want to know their concerns and, above all, to present our economic development guidelines to them. These exchanges will feed our reflection on the creation of a one-stop shop that will make life easier for entrepreneurs. The establishment of the Banque de développement économique du Québec is one of the important mandates entrusted to me by the Premier and I am tackling it now, ”explained Minister Zakaïb.
During this tour, Minister Zakaïb will meet the various business communities (local development centers, chambers of commerce, entrepreneurship tables, etc.), will discuss with elected municipal officials and will visit a few companies.
“For our government, the regions constitute a great wealth. To enrich ourselves collectively, we must also rely on prosperous regions offering quality jobs. It is up to us to take all the necessary measures to provide local businesses with the appropriate instruments to establish lasting prosperity and to exceed their possibilities. We have the ideas, we have the team and, above all, we have the will to take appropriate action to improve the lives of Quebeckers throughout the territory, ”concluded the Minister.
