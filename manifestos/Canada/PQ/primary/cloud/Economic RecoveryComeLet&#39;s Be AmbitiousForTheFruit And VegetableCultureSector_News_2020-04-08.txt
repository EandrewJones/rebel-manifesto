Québec, April 8, 2020 - The MNA for Matane-Matapédia and parliamentary leader of the Parti Québécois, Pascal Bérubé, as well as the MNA for Bonaventure and spokesperson for agriculture and food, Sylvain Roy, propose to the government Quebec to launch a major chore to develop the greenhouse fruit and vegetable growing sector, a lever that could prove to be very advantageous in the context of the economic recovery to come, in several respects.
IN SHORT
The current COVID-19 pandemic represents a turning point and forces us to rethink our ways of doing things. “Suddenly, we realized that we depend a lot - if not too much - on the outside for our supply, especially of fresh fruits and vegetables. Quebec must seize the opportunity to correct this flaw; we have everything we need in human and material resources to develop greenhouse cultivation, a sector of the economy that will create sustainable jobs throughout Quebec, in addition to ensuring the freshness of food and protecting the environment. environment, diversification of our agriculture and reduction of our trade deficit. As a bonus, it would be a strong gesture in terms of economic nationalism, a definite advantage for all Quebecers, ”said the parliamentary leader of the Parti Québécois.
The idea is not new to the Parti Québécois. “In May 2013, our government released the Food Sovereignty Policy. Our objective was to take advantage of the combined knowledge of all branches of the agrifood sector in order to promote local products. Then, at the end of 2018, well before the pandemic, we again wanted to increase Quebec greenhouse vegetable production, among other things to curb the increase in the price of the grocery basket. Going in this direction would be a promising bet, which could certainly pay off in the future. For the government, this would mean investing in innovative projects and granting producers a preferential electricity tariff, for example, ”Sylvain Roy illustrated.
