Quebec - The member for Rousseau and official opposition critic for finance and economic development, Nicolas Marceau, accuses the premier of Quebec, Jean Charest, of misleading the population about the economic situation in Quebec .
“The reality is relentless: from January 1 to December 31, 2011, unfortunately 51,000 jobs were lost in Quebec. These are the figures from the Institut de la statistique du Québec. To say that 38,500 jobs have been created in Quebec, as Jean Charest did today, is to deceive the population, ”denounced Nicolas Marceau.
Quebec is the only province where employment declined during 2011. Moreover, in his last budget, the Minister of Finance, Raymond Bachand, planned to create 55,400 jobs in 2011. “Minister Bachand is therefore in deficit of 106,400 jobs on its forecasts. Hearing Jean Charest say today that he has no reason to believe that Quebec will have an below average economic performance in 2012 is absolutely laughable: all Quebec economists, including the Ministry of Finance, say exactly the opposite ! », Continued the spokesperson.
The member for Rousseau believes that, if the Liberal government persists in jovialism, Quebec is heading straight into a wall. “Last September, we indicated that the Liberal government had burned all its cartridges to stimulate the Quebec economy, in particular by overheating the construction industry with public investments. The net result is that Quebec&#39;s debt has climbed to a record level where Jean Charest can, without a shadow of a doubt, carry the title of Monsieur Debt, ”he added.
“By announcing today the creation of three committees, Jean Charest has once again confirmed it, after his Minister of Finance. Unfortunately, it is not by multiplying the creation of committees and wanting to take Quebeckers for suitcases that we will revive the Quebec economy, ”concluded the MP.
