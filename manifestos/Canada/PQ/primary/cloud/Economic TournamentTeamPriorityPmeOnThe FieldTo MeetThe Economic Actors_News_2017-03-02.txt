Quebec City, March 2, 2017 - The members of the Parti Québécois&#39; Priorité PME team, formed on January 24, MNAs Alain Therrien, Mireille Jean and Martin Ouellet, are proud to begin today their tour of the regions of Quebec which will run until June. They begin, in Montreal and Quebec, with meetings with a dozen national players, who are at the heart of economic activity.
“These organizations with bases throughout Quebec have recognized expertise. They know the challenges business people face. We are three entrepreneurs, so we are aware of the pitfalls they are going through, particularly in terms of administrative burden. We will meet with economic players in order to identify irritants, propose solutions and determine best practices for reducing red tape in cities and in government agencies. The intention is clear: the government of the Parti Québécois in 2018 will be the government of SMEs! », Indicated Alain Therrien.
“Prosperity, innovation, support for young entrepreneurs, export assistance are all aspects that we want to address with entrepreneurs, everywhere in Quebec. We will then be able to propose a concrete plan to improve their overall business environment, in line with the priorities of companies, in order to support them in creating sustainable jobs, for the benefit of all of Quebec. From mid-March, we will be going to all regions to meet with SMEs and the organizations that support them, ”added Mireille Jean.
“The Liberal government&#39;s actions in terms of consultation and support for businesses have hurt several regions. We must take the right course, so that the priorities of the communities are taken into account, the entrepreneurs relieved of their administrative burden and the entrepreneurial succession supported and supported. This is what will fuel our discussions with people in the field, ”concluded Martin Ouellet.
