Quebec - The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of education, research and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, deplores the improvisation of the Liberal government when it comes to education in Quebec .
“During his party&#39;s last general council, Premier Couillard presented himself as the premier of education. This statement would have been encouraging if it hadn&#39;t been impossible to believe. Indeed, to see a prime minister position himself as the savior of education, while he himself is responsible for cuts in direct services to students, such as homework help, textbooks and support for students in difficulty, it&#39;s surreal, ”said the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
Let us recall that during his opening speech, the Prime Minister had designated education as a priority of his government. However, despite everything, cuts of hundreds of millions of dollars to schools, CEGEPs and universities have been made.
“Today, how can we trust the government when it tells us about its ambitions for the success of young people? Once again, the approach he advocates is disorganized, improvised. However, we are very happy to note that after two years and three ministers, including a caquist, the intermingling of structures represented by Bill 86 has been abandoned in order to focus, finally, on academic success. But why is the government still unable to consult and work with the community? “Asked Alexandre Cloutier.
Moreover, the government has announced absolutely nothing new with regard to kindergarten for 4 years. “All he did was extend the pilot project that was put in place under the Parti Québécois government. Obviously, it is trying to recycle existing programs to make people forget its cuts, ”concluded the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
