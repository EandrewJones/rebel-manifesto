Montreal - “The only real party capable of defending the interests of Quebecers in Ottawa is the Bloc Québécois. It is not the Liberal Party, nor the Conservative Party, let alone the New Democratic Party. Moreover, I am very surprised to hear a supposedly sovereignist party, such as Québec Solidaire, support the NDP, a centralizing federalist party in Toronto, ”declared Pauline Marois, leader of the Parti Québécois, when she exercised her mandate. right to vote.
“While everything is once again possible and the Parti Québécois is getting closer to power in Quebec, this is not the time for the sovereignists to give up the game. In the context of the federal election, I invite you to choose Quebec, to vote for the interests of our nation, for our values, to vote for the Bloc Québécois. With a conservative majority, Quebec would lose. Every day, Stephen Harper&#39;s party demonstrates to us its incomprehension of the reality of Quebec. The only way to prevent this majority is to elect as many members of the Bloc Québécois as possible who, with Gilles Duceppe, will stand up for Quebec, ”concluded Ms. Marois.
