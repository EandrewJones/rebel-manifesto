Québec– The member for Rousseau and official opposition critic for finance and revenue, Nicolas Marceau, as well as the member for Marie-Victorin and critic for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville , ask the government to take a clear position and say whether or not it intends to act on the recommendations of the Godbout report, which notably advocates a real explosion in electricity rates.
“It was confirmed to us this morning: bad debts are at an all-time high. There have never been so many Quebec families struggling to pay their electricity bill. With the increases of more than 20% imposed by the last Liberal governments since 2004, it is not only the poorest families who can no longer pay their electricity bills, it is also the families of the middle class. What will happen to them if the government follows the recommendations of the Godbout report and further increases tariffs by 12.6%, in addition to imposing a new 10% tax on overconsumption? Will Philippe Couillard and his ministers soon understand that the middle class cannot provide more? », Asked Nicolas Marceau.
Bernard Drainville agrees. “Hydro-Québec must put an end to certain indecent practices that are completely unfair to Quebeckers. For example, there is an urgent need for subscribers to stop paying metering fees, as new generation meters no longer require manual metering. Hydro-Quebec unduly pockets $ 67 million per year, he illustrated. In addition, the annual interest rate of 14.4% that the Crown corporation imposes on families who have difficulty paying their electricity bill is completely unreasonable and must imperatively be revised downwards. Hydro-Quebec belongs to all Quebecers, after all; let&#39;s not forget that. &quot;
