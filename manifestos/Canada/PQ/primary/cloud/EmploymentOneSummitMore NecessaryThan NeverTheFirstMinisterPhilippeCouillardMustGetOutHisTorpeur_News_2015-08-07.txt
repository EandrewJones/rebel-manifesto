Quebec - The MNA for Saint-Jérôme and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, as well as the MNA for Saint-Jean and spokesperson for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, ask Prime Minister Philippe Couillard to respond to the pressing need to hold an economic summit.
“Quebec, economically, has stagnated since the Liberals came to power. The Plan Nord and the maritime strategy are long-term promises, while people are now losing their jobs. Again this week, the PaperWorks plant in Baie-D&#39;Urfé announced its closure; 150 workers lose their jobs, not to mention the 140 others who suffer the same fate due to the shutdown of activities at the Graphic Packaging cardboard factory in Jonquière. Quebec needs a government that takes matters into its own hands, which is absolutely not the case at present, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“Since the beginning of April 2014, Quebec has created only 29,300 jobs. Remember that Philippe Couillard, during the election campaign, promised 50,000 per year. After 16 months in power, the Liberals are seriously breaking their promise to Quebeckers, ”said the member for Saint-Jean.
“Despite the drop in the Canadian dollar, the manufacturing sector is not recovering. Job losses in several sectors of the economy are piling up, without the government reacting. Women and men who lose their jobs, however, live in difficult situations and must be supported! Added Dave Turcotte.
“The Minister of the Economy, Jacques Daoust, and the Prime Minister are so unsure of what to do in economic matters and to stimulate job creation that they are passing the buck to the young liberals, who will meet on August 15 and 16 in Shawinigan, hoping for a miracle. They don&#39;t have a plan and are desperate for a lifeline. We are once again swimming in the midst of amateurism within the Liberal government, ”concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
