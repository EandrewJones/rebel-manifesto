Quebec - The Minister of Natural Resources, Martine Ouellet, announces the creation of Chauffez vert, a financial assistance aimed at promoting the replacement of residential heating systems fueled by oil or propane by systems powered by electricity or by other renewable energies.
“Chauffez vert will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, ie 329,000 tonnes of CO2 annually, the equivalent of removing 97,000 vehicles from the road network. Almost 60,000 households will be able to benefit from financial assistance of up to $ 1,525, ”said Martine Ouellet.
Central heating systems and water heaters using fuel oil and propane are eligible. For example, owners of a single-family home converting their oil-fired heating system to electricity will have an average reduction in their heating bill of $ 1,250 per year, or an annual decrease of 40%. Thanks to the financial assistance of $ 1,275 from Chauffez vert, the return on the investment is 2.5 years.
To obtain financial assistance, it is necessary that:
However, the home must not be off the grid, must not be connected to an independent network for the production of electrical energy and must not use a dual-energy heating system.

In addition, owners who will benefit from Chauffez vert and who will use the services of a certified contractor to do the conversion work will also be able to benefit from the ÉcoRénov tax credit of 20%, until October 31, 2014.
