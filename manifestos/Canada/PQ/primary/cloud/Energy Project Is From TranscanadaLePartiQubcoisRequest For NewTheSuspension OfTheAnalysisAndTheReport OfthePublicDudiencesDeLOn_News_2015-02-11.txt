Québec - Sylvain Gaudreault, the MNA for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and the environment, as well as the MNA for Marie-Victorin and spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, call on the Quebec government to demand that the National Energy Board (NEB) immediately suspend the study of the Energy East project, while TransCanada submits complete and updated documents in view public hearings of the BAPE.
Three months after the &quot;7 conditions&quot; set by the Minister of the Environment, David Heurtel, the government failed to bring the Energy East project into conformity with Quebec legislation. “It is now a given: the BAPE will have neither the time nor the latitude necessary to carry out a rigorous evaluation of the Energy East project. We again ask Philippe Couillard to demand that the NEB hold the scheduled hearings only after the filing of the BAPE report. With the waltz-hesitation on the location of the port and the incomplete proposal made by the company to the municipality of Lévis, it now seems very clear to us that the route of the pipeline is not yet final, ”declared Sylvain Gaudreault.
&quot;Faced with this glaring lack of information, in addition to the lack of translation of documents into French, the NEB must now postpone its process, to give Quebecers time to know about this project , of what it returns ”, he added.
“We now know that the route of the pipeline is not final; on the NEB side, the machine is gone, while the BAPE has not even started its work yet. We are in the process of forcing the pipeline through the federal government. What is the Quebec government waiting for to ask the NEB to suspend the analysis of an incomplete project? This is the only thing left to do. It is up to Quebecers to decide what happens in their territory, ”concluded Bernard Drainville.
