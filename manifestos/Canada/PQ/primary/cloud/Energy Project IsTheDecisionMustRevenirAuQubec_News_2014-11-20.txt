Quebec - The member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and the environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, believes that the decision to authorize or not the TransCanada Energy East project must rest with the government of Quebec, and not the National Energy Board (NEB), a federal institution.
“Minister David Heurtel sent conditions in a letter to TransCanada, but he is unable to guarantee Quebecers that they will have the last word on this project. The NEB does not assess the impact of the project on climate change, which the BAPE will do. So if the NEB says yes, in addition to having no tangible economic benefits for Quebecers, the decision will not have taken into account their environmental interests. We ask the minister to be clear; it must assure Quebeckers that they have the power to decide, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
The Member added that the National Assembly unanimously demanded that the Government of Quebec assume its jurisdiction in the environment and that it renounce delegating its environmental assessments to the NEB. &quot;The Quebec government must now take another step: remind TransCanada that it cannot use an NEB right to go against the will of Quebecers,&quot; concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
