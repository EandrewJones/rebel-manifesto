Quebec - Sylvain Gaudreault, the member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and the environment, as well as the member for Bourget and spokesperson responsible for the Charter of the French language, Maka Kotto, support the new approach of the Center québécois du droit de l&#39;environnement, supported by many groups, to have the language rights of Francophones recognized before the National Energy Board (NEB). They also require TransCanada to submit a project notice and an environmental impact study to the BAPE, in French.
Last month, even the Commissioner of Official Languages called the NEB to order for violating the Official Languages Act. “Ultimately, it is TransCanada that should take the blame for filing a file almost exclusively in English for its Energy East project. It is crucial that Francophones be able to obtain, in their language, all the information on the TransCanada project, in order to fully understand the risks it involves, particularly in terms of water supply for agricultural land and water supply. human consumption, as well as the impacts of a possible environmental disaster on their territory. In the same perspective, we demand that TransCanada immediately file a project notice and an environmental impact study, in French, with the BAPE, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
“To ignore the status and specificity of Quebec in relation to its official language in the presentation of a document so sensitive and of such great importance is, for me, a contempt that is beyond comprehension. Francophones must be guaranteed a respectful process. The equivalent availability of documents in French and English at the NEB is lacking and this makes access to a fair process more difficult for Francophones. That the federal body can start studying the TransCanada project without the documents it makes available to citizens respecting the official language of Quebec is unacceptable! », Added Maka Kotto.
