Quebec - MP Martine Ouellet, spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of transport, maritime strategy and transport electrification, welcomes the tabling of Bill 100 on the taxi industry.
“Finally, a bill for the taxi industry! We finally have a response to our demands, after two years of illegal taxis, after two ministers of transport, and eight months after we were promised a bill. I am happy that the Minister of Transport, Jacques Daoust, listened to the main demand of the Parti Québécois: that there be a single law that applies to all workers. It is important for the 22,000 workers in the taxi industry, ”said the member for Vachon.
“Also, other requests that we had formulated were listened to. As we proposed in our bill, the license suspension is reflected in what was tabled this morning. In addition, there is an increase in fines, as proposed by the Parti Québécois, ”recalled the spokesperson.
&quot;As for improving service for customers, measures such as rate adjustment and service evaluation are also included in the bill,&quot; continued Martine Ouellet.
“There are, however, several elements that will need to be clarified, in particular those relating to the collection of taxes, a question to which Minister Daoust is particularly sensitive. We will have the opportunity to come back to these elements during the study of the bill in committee, ”added the Member for Vachon.
“Finally, the changes to the Highway Safety Code to better protect cyclists were also expected and welcome. I will close by offering our cooperation to the Minister so that the bill is adopted by the end of the parliamentary session, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
