Montreal - The deputy and candidate of the Parti Québécois in the riding of Gouin, Nicolas Girard, denounced the attempt to manipulate public opinion made by Jean Charest this morning. “The liberal commitment of a new law 35 is an electoral illusion. Jean Charest refused to correct the breaches of Bill 35 before the end of the parliamentary session when we had offered him our collaboration. It&#39;s too little, too late. Jean Charest and the Liberal Party are responsible for lowering ethical standards and increasing the number of cases of corruption. &quot;
Let us recall that the Parti Québécois exposed the fact that a company linked to Tony Accurso, Louisbourg SBC, obtained 180 million dollars in contracts from the Ministry of Transport between the guilty plea for tax evasion of two companies of Mr. Accurso (December 2010) and the tabling of Bill 35 (October 2011). “Minister Lise Thériault affirmed that no more fraudulent entrepreneur could obtain government contracts. However, the Louisbourg SBC company was already receiving numerous government contracts when Bill 35 was tabled. Has the government turned a blind eye? », Wondered Nicolas Girard.
“On several occasions, we have demanded the tabling of a bill before the end of the parliamentary session in June to turn off the tap on Tony Accurso&#39;s numbered companies. The Liberals have always refused, not seeing it as a priority. Suddenly, during an election campaign it becomes so. It smacks of panic in the liberal family, ”added Nicolas Girard.
“On September 4, Quebeckers will have the opportunity to choose a government that will restore order, clean up and restore integrity and honesty. The Parti Québécois has the skills, the knowledge and the team to do so. It is the party best placed to change things, ”concluded Nicolas Girard.
