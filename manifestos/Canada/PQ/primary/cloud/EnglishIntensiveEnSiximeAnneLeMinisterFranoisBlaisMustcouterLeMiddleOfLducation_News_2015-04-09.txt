Quebec - The member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition critic for elementary and secondary education, Nicole Léger, joins her voice to that of various stakeholders in the world of education and affirms that the The implementation of the intensive English program in the sixth year should not be done unilaterally; rather, we must listen to the stakeholders in the school environment and collaborate with them.
“Four years have passed, and it is now clear that the big liberal dream of compulsory English for all in sixth grade does not hold water. Is learning English intensively a good idea for a young person who already has learning difficulties in fifth grade? The answer is no. Is this a good idea for allophone children living in an environment where the English language is omnipresent? No. And the same goes for francophone schools whose students live in an anglophone environment; think west of Montreal. It is for these reasons in particular that compulsory English for all in sixth grade is not viable, ”said Nicole Léger.
“From all sides, we denounce the quality of French among young people, especially in CEGEPs and universities. The resources available should first aim at improving the teaching of our own language, especially in a context where homework assistance, francization and services for students with learning difficulties are undergoing cuts, and when the government wants to increase the number of students per class. Intensive English must be implemented correctly, respecting available resources and supporting teachers and education professionals, ”concluded Nicole Léger.
