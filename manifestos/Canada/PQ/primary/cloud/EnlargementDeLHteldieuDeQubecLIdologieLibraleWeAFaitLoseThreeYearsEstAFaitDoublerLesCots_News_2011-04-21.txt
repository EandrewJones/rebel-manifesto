Quebec - “We should be delighted that the Hôtel-Dieu de Quebec expansion project is taking one more step towards its realization. At the same time, it is absurd that the P3 formula cost us three years and cost us an additional $ 450 million. In terms of public finance management, we could have done better. The ideology of the Liberal Party of Quebec is costing Quebecers dearly ”.
It is in these words that the Member of Parliament for Taschereau and spokesperson for the official opposition in health matters, Agnès Maltais, reacted to the announcement of the construction method of the Pavilion of the Hôtel-Dieu de Québec of the Center hospitalier universitaire of Quebec (CHUQ).
The Member for Taschereau recalls that in February 2007 Prime Minister Jean Charest himself indicated that this expansion project would not cost more than $ 400 million and that the work would begin in 2008. Since this announcement, the costs have increased to $ 535 million, then $ 635 million and now $ 850 million. The worst part is that it is not over, ”said Agnès Maltais.
&quot;The fact that the Ministry of Health and Social Services asked Infrastructure Quebec to redo the analyzes carried out two years earlier by its ancestor, the PPP Agency, clearly shows that the PPP mode was totally inadequate for the expansion. of L&#39;Hôtel-Dieu. We went around in circles for three years, ”she added.
