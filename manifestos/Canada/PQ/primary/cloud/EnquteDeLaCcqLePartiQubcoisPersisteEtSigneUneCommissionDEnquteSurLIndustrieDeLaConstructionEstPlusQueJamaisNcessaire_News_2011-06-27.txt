Quebec - In light of what is revealed in the newspaper La Presse this morning, the member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for public security, Stéphane Bergeron, reiterates the request made by the Parti Québécois for nearly now two years of holding a public and independent commission of inquiry into the construction industry in Quebec.
“Since September 2009, we have been trying to make Jean Charest and his government listen to reason. They turn a deaf ear and since then the problems have multiplied. As the headline of the newspaper this morning, these are more than just rumors. Employers and employees in the construction industry are just as concerned as the rest of the population about allegations of collusion and corruption in the industry in which they work. We are no longer talking about speculation here, as the Prime Minister has been suggesting for two years, but about proven facts! », Said the member for Verchères.
“The squads set up to fight corruption are not working very well. The Marteau squad and the UPAC are producing results which clearly fall short of the problems we have described. A few small arrests will not cure the problem. We are dealing with a well-oiled organized system and we must take great measures to stop this, ”added Stéphane Bergeron.
“As an example of a situation that must end, Constructions Louisbourg Ltée and Simard-Beaudry Construction Inc., owned by Tony Accurso, keep their license from the Régie du bâtiment du Québec and still obtain government contracts as if nothing was, more than six months after Mr. Accurso pleaded guilty to tax fraud charges. This is absurd! Added the deputy.
“It is clear that the actions taken since the start of the crisis in the construction industry are not enough. It is absolutely essential that Jean Charest finally hears reason and that he immediately set up a public and independent commission of inquiry into the construction industry, ”concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
