Quebec, August 18, 2016 - Agnès Maltais, the member for Taschereau and Parti Québécois spokesperson on secularism, reminds the government that there is an urgent need to act to counter the phenomenon of young people trained here in Quebec, fundamentalism and religious radicalism.
“The examples of young Quebecers going abroad are piling up. It is now clear that identified recruiters are acting here in Quebec to instill radicalism. While the liberal government ignores the threat and the CAQ is distracted by wearing the burkini and advocating the establishment of a beach police, we must act, and quickly. We must counter this much more real and direct threat that is taking shape: the fundamentalist discourses that are circulating and the radical preachers who work in Montreal and who recruit our young people, ”said Agnès Maltais.
“These individuals reject our values of secularism, openness and equality between women and men, without the government intervening to restore them to order. This softness favors the rise of religious fundamentalism, which results in the multiplication of controversies, such as that surrounding the wearing of the burkini. This is a consequence that masks the real issue: the work of undermining secularism carried out by these agents of radicalization advocating a rigorous interpretation of Islam, ”continued the spokesperson.
&quot;While the Prime Minister and the Liberal government attack freedom of expression and accuse the lack of openness of Western societies to be the cause of Islamist terrorism, we learn this morning that two of our young people have been victims , right here in Montreal, of radical preachers. Religious fundamentalism poses significant integration and security problems. We have to look at the phenomenon, know what is happening on the ground. We have to do it for our young people. The Liberal government has promised action, but we are still waiting, ”concluded the spokesperson.
