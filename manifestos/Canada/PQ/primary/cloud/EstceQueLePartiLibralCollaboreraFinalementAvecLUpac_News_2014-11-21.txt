Quebec City - In light of the information in La Presse, Taschereau MP and parliamentary leader of the official opposition, Agnès Maltais, as well as Verchères MP and spokesperson on ethics and integrity, Stéphane Bergeron, note that despite the Prime Minister&#39;s commitment to cooperate in police investigations, the UPAC must use spinning to investigate the Liberal Party of Quebec, due to the lack of collaboration of some elements of the parts.
“Upon reading the article, several disturbing questions arise. The Prime Minister became leader of the Liberal Party in April 2013. A UPAC investigation was opened in August 2013. We understand that there were spinning last February, almost a year after the arrival of Philippe Couillard at the head of his party. He has said on numerous occasions that the PLQ collaborates in investigations. Why are spinning mills necessary in this case? He must give a clear signal to his troops: they have a duty to collaborate, ”said Agnès Maltais.
“Police authorities do not resort to shadowing unless the investigation is important and there is a suspicion that serious crimes have been committed. In this case, we are suggesting that there was collusion to cover up corruption, which is extremely serious. The text also tells us that senior officials would be involved. The Secretary General of the Government, Roberto Iglesias, must also order officials to collaborate, ”concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
