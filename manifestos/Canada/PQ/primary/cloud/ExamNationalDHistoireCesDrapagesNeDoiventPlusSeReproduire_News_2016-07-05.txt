The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of education and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, deplores the improvisation and blunders that forced the Minister of Education to award all the points of question 22 of the ministerial history test to all students. He asks the minister to intervene quickly to prevent such a situation from happening again.
“Social networks did not arrive in Quebec in 2016. It is time for the ministry to adjust its practices to ensure the confidentiality of the tests. If we add the math exam two weeks earlier, the ministry made this error twice rather than once during the end of the 2015-2016 school year. This is unacceptable. The minister announces today that he will review the practices of his ministry, but he should have intervened from the first leaks of the mathematics exam. It will now have to be transparent about the actions it will take to restore public confidence, ”said Alexandre Cloutier.
Despite the minister&#39;s remedial efforts, the ministry&#39;s social media leaks will have compromised the history exam assessment process.
“Following the review, the ministry decided to cancel question 22. This very far-reaching decision was taken without investigation and without consulting the minister. This improvisation of the ministry will have caused a lot of stress to hundreds of students. The minister and his department simply did not do their job, and it is the credibility of the evaluation process that is compromised, ”said the member for Lac? Saint? Jean.
