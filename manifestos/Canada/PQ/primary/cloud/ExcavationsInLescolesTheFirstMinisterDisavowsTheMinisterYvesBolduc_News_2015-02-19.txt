Quebec - The member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, noted the about-face of the Prime Minister, who today disowned the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Yves Bolduc.
“During question period, the Prime Minister ruled out strip searches, which his minister has refused to do for three days. The last statement of the Minister of Education in the case of the young girl who was searched by the administration of her school confirmed once again what Quebecers have understood for several months already: Yves Bolduc should no longer be Minister of Education. His latest blunder has taken on a new, international dimension, ”said Stéphane Bédard.
“An independent investigator must now look into the matter, since the Minister of Education is still unable to do his job. In Quebec, everyone except the Prime Minister agrees that Yves Bolduc no longer has any credibility. Indeed, the episode of strip searches comes in addition to many other examples by proving: the generous premiums that he never reimbursed, his declaration on the books in schools, the cuts in the help with homework, tinkering with school board mergers, abandoning the Chapeau, les filles! and Secondary en spectacle… When will Philippe Couillard understand that his Minister of Education must leave his post? Will he finally admit that Yves Bolduc has become a burden on Quebec and the education system? », Concluded Stéphane Bédard.
