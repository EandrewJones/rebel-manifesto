Nicolet - On the occasion of an exceptional tour by members of the Parti Québécois government in the Mauricie and Center-du-Québec regions, the Minister of Natural Resources, Ms. Martine Ouellet, announced the completion of a project $ 130,000 to locate and map the main groundwater reservoirs in the region, as part of the Groundwater Knowledge Acquisition Program of the Ministère du Développement durable, de l&#39;Environnement, de la Faune et des Parcs .
“Groundwater is a very precious natural resource. It is an important source of drinking water for Quebecers. The geological expertise of the Ministère des Ressources naturelles is called upon to draw up a clear portrait of the region&#39;s groundwater resources. This portrait will make it possible to better protect these sources of drinking water and to manage them responsibly, so that they will benefit the citizens of the region for a long time, ”said Martine Ouellet.

The Nicolet-Saint-François sector project will help locate and characterize the region&#39;s aquifers. The maps produced will indicate in particular the geological formations of the territory, the main aquifers in the region as well as their recharge areas and high vulnerability to contamination.
The goal of the Groundwater Knowledge Acquisition Program is to draw a portrait of the groundwater resources of municipal territories in southern Quebec with the ultimate goal of protecting them and ensuring their sustainability.
The members of the Parti Québécois and the government ministers will meet on February 5 and 6 in Shawinigan, on the occasion of the caucus of deputies and the Council of Ministers. They will take advantage of this meeting to tour the nine ridings of the Mauricie region and the Center-du-Québec region. In less than a week, they will be making more than 80 announcements of various kinds. These announcements will contribute to the development and growth of the Mauricie and Center-du-Québec regions.
