Trois-Rivières - On the occasion of an exceptional tour of members of the Parti Québécois government in the Mauricie and Center-du-Québec regions, the Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, announces a principle of $ 149,500 for the construction of a library in Deschaillons-sur-Saint-Laurent.
“The library plays an essential role in the cultural life of a community. By providing for the integration of a modern and accessible library in a multifunctional building, the Municipality of Deschaillons-sur-Saint-Laurent, guided by the recommendations of the BIBLIO Network, is showing itself resolutely visionary. I warmly congratulate its leaders and the people working on this project, ”says Maka Kotto.
Today&#39;s agreement will allow the Municipality of Deschaillons-sur-Saint-Laurent to complete studies relating to the construction project of a multifunctional building in which several municipal services, including those of the library, would be grouped. The development of the library in a new building would provide the population of Deschaillons-sur-Saint-Laurent and the surrounding area with better access to reading and cultural activities.
The agreement in principle is made possible thanks to the Capital Assistance program of the Ministry of Culture and Communications.
The members of the Parti Québécois and the government ministers will meet on February 5 and 6, in Shawinigan, on the occasion of the caucus of deputies and the Council of Ministers. They will take advantage of this meeting to tour the nine ridings of the Mauricie region and the Center-du-Québec region. In less than a week, they will be making more than 80 announcements of various kinds. These announcements will contribute to the development and growth of the Mauricie and Center-du-Québec regions.
