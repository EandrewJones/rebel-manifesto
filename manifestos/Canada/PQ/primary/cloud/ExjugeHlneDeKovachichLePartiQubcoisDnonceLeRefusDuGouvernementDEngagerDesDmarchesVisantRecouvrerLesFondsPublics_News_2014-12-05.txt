Quebec– The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for justice, Alexandre Cloutier, denounces the government&#39;s refusal to take steps to recover the sum of more than $ 200,000 used by the former judge of the Administrative Tribunal of Quebec, Hélène de Kovachich, in a purely personal case.
The government of Quebec is engaged in a period of austerity which demands many sacrifices from the population. Meanwhile, he refuses to take any action aimed at recovering the public funds unfairly used by the ex-judge of Kovachich. “The least it can be is for the Minister of Justice to be diligent in this matter. The Conseil de la justice administrative, as well as the Auditor General of Quebec, blame the use of public funds by ex-judge Hélène de Kovachich. Why will the minister not take formal steps to follow up on these two investigation reports? “Asked Alexandre Cloutier.
The Parti Québécois believes that the government is acting in the most complete inconsistency with regard to the recovery of sums unfairly paid by the State. “On the one hand, the Minister of Justice is tabling a bill aimed at recovering the sums unjustly paid by the State in the granting of public contracts. But, on the other hand, it totally refuses to take any action when it comes to being reimbursed for fees paid unfairly by the Administrative Tribunal of Quebec. This double standard is unacceptable! », Underlined Alexandre Cloutier.
The spokesperson demands that the Minister of Justice stop procrastinating and immediately initiate a process aimed at recovering the sums unfairly used by ex-judge Hélène de Kovachich. “It&#39;s a question of fairness. The government&#39;s credibility is at stake, ”concluded the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
