Quebec - Diane Lamarre, the member for Taillon and official opposition spokesperson for health and access to care, demanded that Minister Gaétan Barrette withdraw the quotas from Bill 20, since we is already beginning to feel its perverse effects; in particular, there is an increase in the exodus of doctors to the private sector.
“By imposing quotas which dehumanize the practice of medicine and which reduce access to care for patients, the Minister of Health has already succeeded in causing an exodus of doctors to the private sector. He must admit that he was wrong and that the result goes against the needs of the population. The minister&#39;s foolish proposal does not respect doctors; they wish to pursue a human practice, where they can take the time to meet each patient without having to take out their stopwatch or their calculator. Why does the minister insist on maintaining quotas which, as we can see, already have a negative impact on the health network and on access to care for patients? ”Said Diane Lamarre.
The figures from the Régie de l&#39;assurance maladie du Québec are clear: between January 1 and April 17, 2015, 28 physicians, including 23 family physicians, disaffiliated. This is more, in three months, than the annual average of the last 10 years, which stands at 24.
“What we have been witnessing for the past five months has been an exodus of doctors. These departures weaken the Quebec public health system and are directly caused by Minister Barrette&#39;s quotas. Quebec is already one of the rare places in the world where there are fewer family physicians than specialists. The minister would like to promote private medicine that he would not do otherwise. If this is not his bill, the problem, how does he explain the increase in the number of doctors who have left the public network for five months? The Minister must withdraw the quotas from his Bill 20, ”concluded Diane Lamarre.
