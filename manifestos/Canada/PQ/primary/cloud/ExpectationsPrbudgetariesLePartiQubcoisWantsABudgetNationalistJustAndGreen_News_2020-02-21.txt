Québec, February 21, 2020 - The member for René-Lévesque, parliamentary leader of the Parti Québécois and finance critic, Martin Ouellet, this morning presented the expectations of his political party with a view to the tabling of the budget by the government , next March 10.
IN SHORT
First, a government claiming to be nationalist must absolutely insist that the federal government not only listen to it, but also its due. “Ottawa has ignored Quebec for too long. Tax points must be repatriated here, to Quebec, as well as all budgets relating to culture. And that&#39;s a minimum. I invite the government of François Legault to show firmness vis-à-vis the federal government; if he needs support, he can count on us, ”said the spokesperson at the outset.
“Quebeckers also expect their government, through its budget, to correct certain injustices. The CAQ must therefore seize the opportunity and ensure that Quebec concretely improves its record in terms of social justice. Vulnerable, destitute or sick people, the elderly, children and women victims of violence, among others, have the right to better protection, to guarantees of fairness, ”added the deputy.
Finally, the Parti Québécois is asking the government to give depth to its environmental claims, which are currently rather pale green. “We are no longer in the era of commitments without follow-up; we have a duty to future generations. Adopting a &quot;carbon budget&quot; would force any government to honor its promises and achieve its goals. In this regard, a good start would be to allocate the funds necessary for the application of the 32 recommendations contained in the CAPERN report on the impacts of the use of pesticides on public health and the environment ”, concluded Martin Ouellet.
