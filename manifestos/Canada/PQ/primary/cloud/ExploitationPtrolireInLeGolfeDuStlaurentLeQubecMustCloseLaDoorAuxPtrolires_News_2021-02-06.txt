Québec, February 6, 2021 - Faced with the stated desire of an Alberta company to study the oil potential in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the leader of the Parti Québécois, Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, as well as the member for Jonquière et porte -speaking on energy, the environment and the fight against climate change, Sylvain Gaudreault, believe that it is becoming imperative to provide Quebec with a legal framework that will ensure that it is the only one to decide on authorized projects . This law will notably clarify that oil and gas development in the Gulf of St. Lawrence is not a possible avenue in Quebec.
IN SHORT
The exit of the Alberta company has created a lot of anger and concern among elected officials of the North Shore, who fear the economic but also environmental consequences of possible oil projects on their territory. “Currently, there is a moratorium preventing all oil and gas exploitation in the St. Lawrence, but for how long? The Government of Quebec must clearly renounce all drilling in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the only way to reassure Quebeckers in this regard is to pass a law. », Insisted Paul St ‑ Pierre Plamondon.
The concern is great, especially for ecosystems. “This majestic inland sea that is the Gulf is recognized by the United Nations for its ecological and biological importance. However, the ecosystems of our river are as fragile as they are rich ”, argued Sylvain Gaudreault. “The government must close the door to the oil companies, but also reaffirm that Quebec will always have the last word on what happens in its territory. To do this, the Parti Québécois invites the government to call as quickly as possible Bill 391, presented by the member for Jonquière, the purpose of which is to assert the primacy of Quebec&#39;s jurisdiction in matters of environment facing Ottawa.
“The pressure is strong now. Recently, the Government of Canada has been very aggressive in this regard. Not only is it stepping up initiatives to promote oil exploitation in the marine environment, particularly off the coast of Newfoundland - it has just authorized no less than 40 exploratory drilling operations there! - but, in addition, it abolished the environmental assessment process to speed up the approval of future projects. Quebec must therefore be more vigilant than ever and adopt clear policies! », Concluded the leader of the Parti Québécois.
