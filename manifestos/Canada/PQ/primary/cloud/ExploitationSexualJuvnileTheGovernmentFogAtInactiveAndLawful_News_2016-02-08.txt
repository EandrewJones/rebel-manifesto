Quebec - The spokespersons for the Parti Québécois on the status of women, Carole Poirier, and youth protection, Jean-François Lisée, denounced the Couillard government&#39;s inaction on the issue of juvenile sexual exploitation.
&quot;One of the first decisions of the government in this matter, in 2014, was to refuse the request of the Police Department of the City of Montreal for the funding of its mixed metropolitan squad to fight against prostitution and human trafficking,&quot; revealed Mr. Lisée. The end of inadmissibility was motivated by purely budgetary reasons. &quot;
The SPVM also participated in the interministerial committee on these issues set up by the Parti Québécois government and presented it with the “main shortcomings” and “means to be implemented” to tackle the problems. From September 2013 to February 2014, 261 groups were heard and recommendations were made. The National Assembly unanimously voted on a motion denouncing human trafficking and calling for an action plan.
Carole Poirier explained that “the Couillard government received this report as soon as it took office in April 2014. It could have relied on the recommendations it contained to take positive action. Rather, he decided to leave the recommendations on a shelf. The report was never made public and we had no follow-up ”.
“Everyone involved was preparing for a major mobilization and action against child prostitution when the Liberal Party took power. They were very disappointed to find that this was not a priority for the Liberal government, ”said Ms. Poirier. “We lost two years,” added Lisée.
Members call on the government to immediately make the report public and indicate how it intends to act quickly on the recommendations. &quot;The Liberals&#39; refusal to give the SPVM the means to act comes on top of their decision to cut the budget of youth centers by $ 20 million per year and to reduce by 20% the amounts allocated to organizations that fight in the field. against the influence of street gangs, denounced Jean-François Lisée. The government must restore these amounts immediately and make an even greater effort in the short term. &quot;
