Montreal - “This morning, La Presse revealed that in January 2011, the Minister of Transport, Sam Hamad, was informed by the Metropolitan Transport Agency of a revised estimate of the costs of the Train de l&#39;Est at 665 million. The Minister authorized the continuation of the project for commissioning in the fall of 2012. Eight months later, the President of the Treasury Board, Michelle Courchesne, announced that she was putting the brakes on the project. &quot; Is there a pilot on the plane? Does the right hand know what the left hand is doing in this government? Declared the official opposition spokesperson for transport and MNA for Gouin, Nicolas Girard.
The member for Gouin demanded that the Minister of Transport provide the public with an explanation of this new Liberal mess in the management of major projects. He demanded full transparency. “After the CHUM saga, the Ville-Marie tunnel incident, citizens are once again paying the price for liberal laxity. Minister Hamad had promised the population of eastern Montreal and the Repentigny, Mascouche and Terrebonne sectors that the Train de l&#39;Est would be put into service in 2012. However, not only are citizens today learning of an explosion 70% of the project costs, but in addition the train will not be ready before 2013 ”, argued the MP for Gouin.
The official opposition critic for transport deplores the fact that many citizens of the Lanaudière and Montreal region will once again have to arm themselves with patience and spend long hours in traffic jams. “Liberal amateurism is costing taxpayers and Quebec motorists dearly,” concluded the member for Gouin.
