Quebec - The member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and the environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, wishes to reaffirm that the Parti Québécois government has never accepted that Quebec be considered a mere highway for the export of Alberta oil without Quebecers perceiving any profit.
“The debate on the passage of oil from the West to the territory of Quebec will not be resolved by the issuance of a certificate of authorization. The decision is not administrative: it is political. It will always be up to Quebecers to decide what happens in their territory and what their environmental and energy future will look like, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
According to the MP, the Prime Minister is trying to create a diversion, because he has accepted the passage of supertankers on the St. Lawrence River, even though British Columbia and the United States refuse.
“The Liberal government accepts without flinching that the St. Lawrence River becomes a highway for the export of Alberta oil. Philippe Couillard even locked Quebec into the Canadian Energy Strategy, without consulting Quebecers. The only consultation he made was with Stephen Harper, ”added Sylvain Gaudreault.
&quot;In light of current information on security and environmental protection issues, a Parti Québécois government has suspended the certificate of authorization granted to the Kildair company and invited Quebecers to a public debate on our future energy, which the Couillard government is not doing by unconditionally accepting the passage of oil from Alberta to Quebec, ”concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
