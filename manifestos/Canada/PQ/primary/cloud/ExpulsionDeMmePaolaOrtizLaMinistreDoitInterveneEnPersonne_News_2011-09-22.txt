Quebec - The member for Drummond and official opposition critic for immigration and language, Yves-François Blanchet, said he was surprised that the Minister of Immigration had not expressed her intention to intervene personally in the case of the expulsion of Ms. Paola Ortiz. “The Minister expressed concern and gave the mandate to her officials as we are 24 hours away from the expulsion of Ms. Ortiz. This is completely insufficient, ”insisted Yves-François Blanchet.
Recall that the Government of Canada refuses refugee status to this Quebecer from Mexico, married to a Quebecer and mother of two children born in Quebec, holding a job in Montreal, despite the violence inflicted on her by her ex. - spouse in Mexico.
The official opposition, the government and the Second Opposition Party expressed their agreement today with an unannounced motion that read as follows:
Unfortunately, the member for Crémazie, Lisette Lapointe, refused her consent to the tabling of this motion. “The will of the National Assembly nevertheless appears clear to us. We assume that the Minister has already intervened to avoid the expulsion of Ms. Ortiz for whom every minute counts, ”concluded the deputy.
