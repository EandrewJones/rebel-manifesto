Sorel-Tracy– The Parti Québécois candidate in the riding of Richelieu, Élaine Zakaïb, is outraged by the federal government&#39;s decision to expel a resident of Portuguese origin in Saint-Roch-de-Richelieu, Mr. Jose Pereira. “Settled in Quebec for more than 30 years, Mr. Pereira is married to a French-speaking Quebecer, he had his children in Quebec who, in turn, had children. In his case, we don&#39;t even talk about integration anymore, he integrated in 1980! Exclaimed the Parti Québécois candidate.
“The Conservative government is removing all kinds of humanity from its immigration rules. He breaks up a family, interferes with their lives and causes tragedy. In the name of what? From an administrative imbroglio! We must be made low. The Government of Canada is behaving like a real heartless ”, condemned Élaine Zakaïb.
“It has to stop. I call on all parties to put pressure on the federal government, beyond partisanship, to prevent Mr. Pereira&#39;s extradition. We must act quickly, ”she added, inviting all of Richelieu&#39;s candidates to put pressure on the Minister of Immigration.
“The Liberals are still in power, at least for a few weeks. Let them act! What Canada is doing to a Quebecer is scandalous, despicable and contrary to all the values of Quebec society. We must quickly give ourselves a country, but in the meantime, let&#39;s prevent this injustice, ”concluded Élaine Zakaïb.
