Salaberry-de-Valleyfield– The Member for Beauharnois and Vice-President of the Committee on the Economy and Labor, Mr. Guy Leclair, on behalf of the Minister for Industrial Policy and the Banque de développement économique du Québec, Ms. Élaine ZakaÏb congratulated the actors of the Regional County Municipality (MRC) of Beauharnois-Salaberry for the results of the redeployment plan.
Thanks to this redeployment plan, launched in 2008, several structuring projects have been carried out, including the establishment of new industrial parks, the revitalization of unoccupied buildings or land and the expansion of the port of Valleyfield. This regional synergy has also made it possible to increase the economic spinoffs linked to the construction of Highway 30 and the creation of more than 6,000 manufacturing jobs, while generating spinoffs of over $ 80 million.
&quot;I am very proud of the work accomplished by the players in the field to promote the economic development of the Beauharnois-Salaberry RCM,&quot; said MP Guy Leclair. “Their significant mobilization led to the success of the MRC&#39;s economic redeployment plan and its 15 structuring projects. Their efforts have thus enabled thousands of people to continue working and fully participate in the economic growth of Beauharnois-Salaberry. &quot;
&quot;The revival of the manufacturing industry is essential to diversify our economy,&quot; said Minister Delegate Élaine Zakaïb. “The involvement of the various partners in carrying out projects in the Beauharnois-Salaberry MRC has enabled many workers to actively participate in the economic development of their region. These commitments help stimulate the economy and promote growth in Quebec. &quot;
