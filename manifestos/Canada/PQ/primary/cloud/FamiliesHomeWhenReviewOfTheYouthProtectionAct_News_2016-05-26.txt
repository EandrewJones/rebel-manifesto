On this occasion, he was accompanied by Ms. Jacinthe Boucher, President of the Federation of Host Families and Intermediate Resources of Quebec (FFARIQ).
“We were impatiently awaiting 2016, since it is a year of review and update of the Youth Protection Act. We invite Minister Charlebois to seize this opportunity to make improvements, in particular with regard to the role and rights of foster families who take care of the most vulnerable children on a daily basis, ”said the deputy.
“Among other changes that could be made to the YPA, let us mention the recognition of foster families in the context of legal processes. In Ontario, the Child and Family Services Act states that a foster family is entitled to party status in legal proceedings if a child has been placed there for at least six months. is not the case in Quebec. The FFARIQ is also rigorously carrying this file and I would like to underline its commitment to families in several regions of Quebec, ”added Jean-François Lisée.
“Today in the House, I tabled a petition asking the Minister to act for the good of foster families. After his mess in the case of fugues and barred doors at the Laval youth center, it is time that we sit down together to assess all avenues for improvement of the YPA, ”concluded the spokesperson.
