Laurierville - The Deputy Premier and Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr. François Gendron, is proud to participate in the inauguration of the factory-warehouse of the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers, in Laurierville.
“This factory-warehouse will allow you to pursue your collective efforts to ensure sound management of the strategic maple syrup reserve. This reserve is a real treasure which constitutes a solid base for your industry ”, underlined the Minister.
The warehouse factory was erected to meet the space requirements for the strategic global maple syrup reserve. To support the construction of this building, the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers received financial assistance of nearly $ 394,000 from the provincial and federal governments.
“Maple syrup and all its derivatives occupy a prominent place in our food offer. These are distinctive products that are linked both to our heritage and to the extraordinary spirit of innovation that characterizes Quebecers. In fact, this corresponds exactly to what I have in mind when I think of the strong identity of Quebec foods, which represents one of the four pillars of our Food Sovereignty Policy, ”added François Gendron.
