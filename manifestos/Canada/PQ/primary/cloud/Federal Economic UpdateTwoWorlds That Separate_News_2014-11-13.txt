Quebec - The member for Rousseau and official opposition critic for finance, Nicolas Marceau, deplores the fact that the management of the Liberal government has isolated Quebec by slowing the economy and creating a climate of uncertainty that is damaging to the economy. employment and regional development, while the federal government continues to rack up surpluses.
“We are in two completely different worlds. On the one hand, there is the situation in which the Liberal government has placed us: lower growth in Quebec, lower jobs, major cuts, new round of tax increases. Meanwhile, in Ottawa, there is an increase in growth, in the number of jobs, as well as in budget surpluses despite the tax cuts, ”declared Nicolas Marceau.
Between March and today, $ 17 billion in surplus was added to the federal forecasts, while the government of Stephen Harper is preparing to cut $ 10 billion in federal transfers to Quebec for health. “The Minister of Finance should not believe his eyes, he who denied the existence of the fiscal imbalance. Rather than thinking of further increasing taxes and tariffs, he should demand the cancellation of Ottawa&#39;s cuts in health, the federal government swimming in the surplus, ”continued the Member for Rousseau.
Nicolas Marceau also points out that while 82,000 full-time jobs were lost in Quebec, 131,000 were added in the rest of Canada. “Philippe Couillard&#39;s Liberal government broke a 23-year-old record of mediocrity regarding job losses, a record set by his party. The liberal effect ultimately only means the dismantling of regional development tools and record job losses. When he claims that there will be no job recovery plan, the Minister of Finance is rebuffed by his Prime Minister. What the economic update is showing us today is that the Liberal government needs to get its act together and quickly table an economic development plan, ”he concluded.
