Quebec - Nicole Léger, the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for elementary and secondary education and school perseverance, asks the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Yves Bolduc, to order an audit of the fees imposed on parents in elementary and secondary schools in Quebec.
This verification is necessary, in light of the publication today of an article in La Presse reporting fees of $ 100 imposed by the Commission scolaire des Grandes-Seigneuries for surveillance during the lunch hour. , even if the child eats at home.
“Minister Yves Bolduc must worry about the invoice sent by the schools and, in the event that there is illegal invoicing, demand that parents be reimbursed as soon as possible. Only an exhaustive check will make it possible to determine whether or not this is a common phenomenon in all school boards, ”said Nicole Léger.
“There are already rules governing the fees payable. The least thing is for the government to enforce them. To do this, he must order an immediate verification, ”concluded the member of the Parti Québécois.
