Quebec - Today, the DPCP confirmed that with regard to the SharQc trial, the work of the police officers who, for some, risked their lives to thwart organized crime has been purely and simply nullified. The Minister of Justice, Stéphanie Vallée, who has remained silent until now, owes explanations to these men and women, as well as to all Quebecers, affirm Stéphane Bédard and Pascal Bérubé, spokespersons respectively. of the Parti Québécois in matters of justice and public safety.
&quot;Out of respect for investigators and police officers who have worked for years to accumulate sufficient evidence to bring serious charges against highly criminalized individuals, the Minister of Justice must herself shed light on the events that led to to the failure of the SharQc trial and to act so that such a situation does not happen again ”, declared Pascal Bérubé.
“It is sad to see the first person in charge of justice in Quebec remain silent in the face of one of the worst mess in our judicial history. It is high time for it to stop hiding, to assume its responsibilities, and to explain to Quebecers the reasons that led to this dismal failure, ”claimed Stéphane Bédard.
Remember that the SharQc trial is one of the largest in the history of Quebec and that it is the second time that such a situation has arisen. In fact, in 2011, 31 of the 156 accused had been released. “It&#39;s deplorable. It is as if this government has not learned a lesson. And, moreover, in the current context, it would be urgent for the Minister to explain to us the reasons which led her to reduce the number of prosecutors in Quebec, ”concluded Stéphane Bédard.
