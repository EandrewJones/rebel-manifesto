Quebec - The member for Gouin and official opposition critic for transport, Nicolas Girard, is surprised that, despite the adoption of two laws (Bill 73 in 2009 and Bill 35 in 2011), companies linked to the construction industry, whose leaders plead guilty under criminal laws, still obtain lucrative contracts from the Quebec government.
Last week, pressed for questions by the Parti Québécois in the National Assembly, two ministers of the Charest government, the ministers of Labor and Transport, Lise Thériault and Pierre Moreau, in turn indicated that the law could indeed have to be reviewed. given the existence of a breach. This week, the government adopts a new speech and says that everything is perfect.
“Despite the demonstration made and despite the admission of two ministers last week, we are being told today that we are going to leave it the same. This is nonsense! The Liberal government no longer wants to block the road to fraudsters. Why? What happened on the weekend to make the government change its mind? Who did the Charest government get the phone from to make such a spectacular shift? Asks MP Nicolas Girard.
For the Parti Québécois, the law must absolutely be amended before the adjournment of parliamentary business next June. He offers his collaboration. “By means of corporate veils, we circumvent the law. The government knows it and does not want to do anything. We have four weeks left to fix the law. Minister Thériault must present us with another bill to prevent fraudsters from obtaining millions of dollars in contracts from the Department of Transport. If it does not do so, we will have to conclude that the government seeks to protect the world, ”concluded Nicolas Girard.
