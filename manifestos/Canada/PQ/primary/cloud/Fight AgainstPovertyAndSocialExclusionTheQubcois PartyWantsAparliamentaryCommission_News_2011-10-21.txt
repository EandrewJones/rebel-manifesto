Quebec - “The adoption of a law in 2002 by the Parti Québécois to fight poverty and social exclusion has since forced the government to adjust its programs. Despite everything, the work is far from being completed: too many people still live in poverty and certain decisions taken in recent years have been catastrophic, notably through major price increases. It is time to take stock ”.
This was stated by the member for Saint-Jean and official opposition spokesperson for employment, social solidarity and the fight against poverty, Dave Turcotte, reiterating the request made by the Parti Québécois. , on June 14, for the holding of a parliamentary committee.
This request is supported by many organizations as well as by the Collective for a Quebec Without Poverty. The objective is to study the opinion of the Advisory Committee for the Fight against Poverty and Social Exclusion on the income targets sent to the government in 2009.
“It is now necessary for parliamentarians to hear the independent experts who participated in the drafting of this opinion and the organizations which act directly with the most disadvantaged in order to verify whether the government response that came in June 2011 is up to the task. It is our duty, as elected officials, to ensure that not only the law, but also the spirit of the law adopted in 2002 are respected. We therefore hope that the Liberal government will finally respond to this request for a parliamentary committee formulated last June and which is the subject of a very broad consensus in Quebec, ”concluded Dave Turcotte.
