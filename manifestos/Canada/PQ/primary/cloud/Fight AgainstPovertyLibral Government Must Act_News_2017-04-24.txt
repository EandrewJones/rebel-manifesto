Quebec, April 24, 2017 - Harold LeBel, Parti Québécois spokesperson for employment, social solidarity and the fight against poverty, is asking the Liberal government to stop dragging its feet. “The fight against poverty requires immediate investments,” he insisted.
IN SHORT
“Liberal austerity has hurt a large number of sectors in Quebec, and the fight against poverty is among the hardest hit. It has been shown on several occasions that the cuts had a real impact on services to the population, contrary to the promises and claims of the Prime Minister. This is an issue that does not seem to concern his government; as proof, the sums provided for this purpose in its latest budget, clearly insufficient. However, Quebec must defend the most disadvantaged, it cannot abandon them, ”continued Harold LeBel.
He mentions two major issues related to the fight against poverty in which the Minister of Social Solidarity, François Blais, is particularly dragging his feet. “First, we still don&#39;t know the details of welfare reform. After having passed it by forced march this fall, in widespread opposition, the Liberals let the publication of the regulations drag on. It&#39;s a shame! The government must tell us the details of the changes without delay. In addition, we have waited too long for the tabling of the plan to fight poverty and social exclusion. François Blais must act and quickly present his strategy to us, ”he concluded.
