Quebec - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for finance and revenue, Nicolas Marceau, the spokesperson for the economy and exports, Alain Therrien, and the spokesperson for employment and social economy, Dave Turcotte, deplore the total lack of action of the Liberal government in the face of the crisis in Quebec in terms of job creation. In fact, once again last month, in net terms, Quebec lost 5,600 jobs. But we especially remember the loss of 24,600 full-time jobs.
“According to the Liberal promise to create 250,000 jobs, there should be 75,000 more jobs in Quebec after a year and a half. The Liberals did not deliver half of it, and we owe the meager improvement to the creation of part-time jobs, especially ”, indicated Nicolas Marceau.
Quebec is going through an employment crisis, while the rest of Canada is experiencing strong growth in this area. In the past six months, in fact, Quebec has lost 10,200 jobs, while the rest of Canada created 137,800. “In 19 months of Liberal rule, Quebec has stalled economically. Virtually no full-time jobs were created, while Canada created 237,300. Only 2.8% of full-time jobs were therefore created in Quebec. Why does the government insist on not presenting an economic development plan? “Asked Alain Therrien.
We also see that there is no improvement in the unemployment rate. “While workers are unemployed, the Liberals are not proposing any structural measure to stimulate employment in Quebec. Worse, they attack avenues for improving the living conditions of workers: popular education centers, youth centers? Employment, local employment centers, etc. These are very gloomy prospects imposed on us by the Liberal government, ”concluded Dave Turcotte.
