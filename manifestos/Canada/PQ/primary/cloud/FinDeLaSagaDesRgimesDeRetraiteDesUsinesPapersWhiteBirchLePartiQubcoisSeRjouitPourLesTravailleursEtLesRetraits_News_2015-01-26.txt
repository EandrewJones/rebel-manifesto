Québec– The MNA for Taschereau and spokesperson for the official opposition responsible for the Capitale-Nationale region, Agnès Maltais, and the MNA for Sanguinet and critic for pensions, Alain Therrien, are delighted to the signing of the texts of the new pension plans of the White Birch Papers factories, which puts an end to a difficult battle lasting more than five years for workers and retirees.
“Significant concessions have been made by workers and retirees to save their jobs and their pensions. With the signing of these texts, Papiers White Birch retirees will finally be able to receive the sums due to them. Thousands of families are breathing a sigh of relief today, ”said Alain Therrien.
The member for Taschereau, for her part, paid tribute to the men and women who led the battle on this issue. “We must underline the work, perseverance and efforts deployed by workers and retirees in the face of this situation which has become intolerable. Moreover, those who are fighting for a dignified and well-deserved retirement must have the support of their governments; today, the Parti Québécois is proud to have taken concrete steps to defend the retirees of Papiers White Birch, ”added Agnès Maltais.
Actions by the Parti Québécois government
It should be remembered that the Parti Québécois government intervened quickly and maintained the pressure on the company to recover the money to which the workers and retirees of Papiers White Birch were entitled. In December 2012, he presented and passed the law that allows the existence of the target benefit component of the pension plans established for unionized workers. In addition, the Parti Québécois enacted the two regulations necessary for the registration of new plans: one establishing the rules relating to the recognition of benefits for service prior to the date of termination of the plans, and the other establishing the rules relating to target benefit pension plans for service after that date.
