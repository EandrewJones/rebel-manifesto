Quebec - As the consultations on Bill 44, An Act to strengthen the fight against tobacco use, come to an end today, the Member for Rosemont and Parti Québécois spokesperson for prevention, Jean-François Lisée, presents new amendments that the official opposition intends to table in order to improve it.
&quot;Bill 44, introduced by the government, does only part of the work necessary to reduce smoking and its ravages, which cost Quebecers $ 1.6 billion annually and cause 28 deaths per day,&quot; declared the hon. member for Rosemont.
“The Liberal government is reluctant to adopt the proven measure to reduce smoking in Australia, plain packaging, as well as a moratorium on all new tobacco products. He seems to fear the reaction of the tobacco companies, ”added the MP.
In May, the Parti Québécois announced that it would present amendments to this effect, supported by several of the 36 groups that have come to testify since. However, the responsible minister gave no indication of having moved forward on these issues. Today, the member for Rosemont announced that the official opposition intends to table several other amendments. “The groups that participated in the public consultations are unanimous: Quebec must resume its place as a leader in the fight against smoking. It is this will that will guide our interventions during the next legislative stages, ”he continued.
Here are the amendments in question:
“It is essential that Quebec use all the powers in its possession to fight against smoking, and that it does not give in to pressure from tobacco lobbies to pass only an incomplete bill. Neither can it count on a hypothetical action from Ottawa to serve Quebec&#39;s public health. Now is the time to act, ”concluded the deputy.
