Québec, May 26, 2016 - André Villeneuve, the member for Berthier and Parti Québécois spokesperson for agriculture and food, today tabled Bill 599, An Act to counter land grabbing agricultural land.
“I am proud to take concrete action today against the grabbing of farmland. These lands are a finite resource. For this reason, they have become a safe haven for some private investment funds, which has caused their price to increase. In Quebec, we have chosen to keep agriculture on a human scale, and therefore to focus on the model of family farms. A year ago, at my request, consultations on land grabbing were held; several stakeholders then came to tell us that we had to legislate to protect this model. However, the government and the CAQ have decided to do nothing. The Parti Québécois has chosen to act because the status quo is unacceptable, ”declared André Villeneuve.
The terms of the bill will ensure that any transaction involving agricultural land must be declared to the Commission de protection du territoire agricole du Québec (CPTAQ). For the acquisition of land increasing the total of land owned to more than 100 hectares, the CPTAQ will have to authorize the transaction according to a certain number of criteria, in order to ensure that a farmer becomes the owner. . A transaction concluded in violation of the law will be declared void, and fines - of up to $ 30,000 for a company and up to $ 5,000 for a natural person - are foreseen.
“Farmland must belong to the farmers. They, along with their successors and the municipalities, are asking us to act. This is the reason why I tabled this bill: to fight against investment funds that are interested in Quebec lands in a purely speculative way, and not for the benefit of agriculture, ”concluded the Minister. Member of Parliament for Berthier.
