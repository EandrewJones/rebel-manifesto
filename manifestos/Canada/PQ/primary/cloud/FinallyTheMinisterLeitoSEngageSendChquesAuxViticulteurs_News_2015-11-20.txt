Quebec - The Parti Québécois agriculture and food spokesperson, André Villeneuve, is delighted to have succeeded in obtaining a commitment from the Minister of Finance regarding the support that must be given to Quebec winegrowers. Indeed, after having evaded the question in the morning, yesterday, Carlos Leitão reconsidered his position when the deputy for Berthier questioned him again, in the early evening, in the National Assembly.
“The support program for winegrowers, enhanced by the Parti Québécois in 2013, has led to a meteoric increase in sales of Quebec wines. However, the dithering of the Liberal government is hampering the pursuit of this growth. Checks should have been deposited for a long time. Wine growers have invested large sums, and late payments from the government put their businesses at risk, ”said André Villeneuve.
It should be remembered that for the second year in a row, it took an intervention by the official opposition in the National Assembly for the Minister of Finance to respect the commitment made by his government.
“It is abnormal that I had to intervene, again this year, for the government to honor its word. The winegrowers have fulfilled their part of the contract and invested considerably to increase their presence in the market. It is the least that the government can do to honor its commitment and pay the sums it owes these entrepreneurs. Besides, where was the Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, in this file? He should have been there for the winegrowers and intervened with his colleague so that the checks were sent quickly, ”concluded the member for Berthier.
