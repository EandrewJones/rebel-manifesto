Quebec - The official opposition spokesperson for social services and youth protection, Dave Turcotte, denounces the maneuvers used by the Minister for Rehabilitation, Youth Protection and Public Health and to Healthy Habits, Lucie Charlebois, when it comes to funding for community organizations. “It&#39;s nothing but creative accounting aimed at making government look good,” he argues.
IN SHORT
Since the last budget, when she talks about funding for community organizations, the minister has been playing with words. She has proven that once again today. “Lucie Charlebois affirms and reiterates that the increase is $ 80 million over 5 years, but this is false: it is an accumulation of sums. In fact, funding for community organizations will be increased by only $ 25 million over 5 years. The government maintains the vagueness in order to look good, but we will not let it fool people. Organizations have denounced this creative accounting, as have we, and we will continue to do so, ”said Dave Turcotte.
“This morning, the Liberal government boasted of having accumulated surpluses in the state coffers. Well, these should be used to increase funding for community organizations! Twenty-five million is very little. For our part, we are committed to increasing the funding of the mission of independent community action organizations in all sectors, the spokesperson reminded us. The environment has suffered enough from liberal austerity. &quot;
The Parti Québécois is in fact committed to increasing the funding of the mission of independent community action organizations in all sectors by $ 60 million recurring and cumulative over three years: $ 60 million the first year, $ 120 million. the following year and $ 180 million the third year. Funding for organizations will be multi-year, more stable and will be indexed annually for all independent community action organizations.
