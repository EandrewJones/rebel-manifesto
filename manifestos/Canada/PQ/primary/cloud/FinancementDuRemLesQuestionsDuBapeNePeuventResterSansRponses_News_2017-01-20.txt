Quebec, January 20, 2017 - In light of the information obtained by certain media, the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of transport, Alain Therrien, denounces the opacity of the government with regard to the financing of the Metropolitan Electricity Network (REM), as well as his refusal to listen to the BAPE&#39;s warnings.
“Everything indicates that the BAPE report will confirm the many doubts raised by Quebecers and several economists as to the profitability of the project piloted by the CDPQ Infra. Contrary to what the government claims, questioning the profitability and financing of such a project is certainly not an &quot;ideological&quot; bias, but rather common sense, &quot;said the spokesperson.
“It is the government which acts by blind electorate by imposing the fulfillment of its electoral promise at all costs to the Caisse de dépôt, and by ignoring the financial risks for its depositors, the taxpayers and the municipalities. Let us remember that the CDPQ Infra was annoyed to be questioned about this by the BAPE. What is she trying to hide? “, Also questioned the deputy.
“The CDPQ Infra, which has never operated such a public transport network, has a performance obligation towards Quebec savers. However, no existing public transit company in North America is currently profitable. Who will foot the bill for reconciling the two realities? We already know that Hydro-Québec will have to subsidize the project. This is not what was expected! &quot;, he added.
“The Parti Québécois will be on the heels of the government in order to obtain clear answers on the financing of the REM. We will ensure that the bill will not be passed on to taxpayers and municipalities in the Montreal region, while the CDPQ Infra plans to sell half of its stake in the project. We will not let public subsidies enrich private investors. The government must provide answers to Quebecers, ”concluded Alain Therrien.
