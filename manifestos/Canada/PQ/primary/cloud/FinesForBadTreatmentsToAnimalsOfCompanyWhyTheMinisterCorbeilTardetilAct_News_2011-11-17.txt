Quebec - “The opposition had to intervene and put pressure on the government to announce the possible tabling of a bill to increase fines for puppy mill operators. It is distressing for the population who expected the government to act as soon as the report of the working group on companion animals was tabled more than two years ago, ”declared the member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata and added. - speech of the official opposition in matters of agriculture and food, André Simard, following a question put to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Corbeil.
“The report expressly proposed to increase the fines which are currently far from dissuasive. When an owner is fined $ 600 when he can sell his dogs for hundreds of dollars each, there is reason to question the penalty imposed. In addition, the draft regulation on the safety and well-being of pets announced last June is not successful, ”added André Simard.
“The Liberal government is slow to tackle the problems of puppy mills and to take the necessary steps to redress the situation in Quebec. As the population is claiming, we in the Parti Québécois no longer want to see other cases of puppy mills in Quebec. These unacceptable situations must end. Minister Corbeil must assume his responsibilities and act without delay, ”concluded the Member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata.
