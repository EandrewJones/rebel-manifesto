Quebec - Quebec Premier Pauline Marois informs the public that widespread precipitation over central and northern Quebec means that the progression of fires in these areas is expected to slow significantly today. The situation is more problematic on the North Shore where some places have received less precipitation.
“We expect a certain lull over the next few days near James Bay and north of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. By mutual agreement, the partners responsible for civil security for the Nord-du-Québec region and the James Bay sector have decided that the situation is no longer problematic. As for the North Shore, the three fires that were considered uncontrolled yesterday north of the Manicouagan reservoir and in the Rivière-aux-Outardes sector are contained. On the other hand, due to the less significant precipitation observed and the flammability indices that could change, caution is required throughout eastern Quebec, ”said the Premier.
No problem has been reported on the electricity transmission network in the James Bay sector or for eastern Quebec. Hydro-Québec continues to closely monitor the situation and is carrying out preventive work to secure its facilities.
“We must give a little respite to those who protect Quebec communities, infrastructures and forests against these fires. This is why another group of combatants from Massachusetts is now taking over and adding to the many support received by Quebec in this fight, ”concluded the Premier.
Following improvements related to weather conditions and to the work of teams fighting forest fires, the fire update will be given based on the prevailing situation. The collaboration of all remains essential.
