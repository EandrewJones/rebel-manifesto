Quebec, August 23, 2019 - Joël Arseneau, MP for Îles-de-la-Madeleine and Parti Québécois spokesperson for international relations, as well as environment spokesperson and MP for Jonquière, Sylvain Gaudreault, and the spokesperson for forests and MP for Bonaventure, Sylvain Roy, are following with concern the evolution of the many fires that are ravaging the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. They ask the Quebec government to offer logistical support to the authorities in place, through the Quebec office in São Paulo.
IN SHORT
“It is very disturbing to see the images of fires in the Amazon, to see their progression and their very significant increase in number. This catastrophe risks modifying, or even weakening in the long term, the &quot;lung of the Earth&quot;, one of the most important ecosystems on the planet; we must do something to minimize the consequences, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault first.
&quot;In this unfortunate situation, we are not necessarily powerless,&quot; continued Joël Arseneau. Quebec has an official office in São Paulo, Brazil. We have good relations, and everything we need to collaborate effectively with the authorities on the spot and help them in their fight against the fires, ”he said.
For his part, Sylvain Roy reminds that Quebec also has recognized expertise in the fight against forest fires. &quot;We can put SOPFEU professionals at the disposal of the Brazilian authorities,&quot; he said. They have all the necessary experience, and have state-of-the-art equipment whose effectiveness has been proven time and time again. One thing is certain, we cannot remain inactive in the face of this crisis. &quot;
