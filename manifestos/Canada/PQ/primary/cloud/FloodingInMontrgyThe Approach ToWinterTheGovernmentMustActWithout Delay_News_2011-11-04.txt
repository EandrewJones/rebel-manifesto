Quebec - The member for Iberville, Marie Bouillé, as well as the member for Saint-Jean, Dave Turcotte, questioned the Minister of Public Security this morning in the National Assembly about the floods this spring in Montérégie.
“Citizens are poorly informed about assistance programs and the possibilities available to them. A few weeks ago, the minister set up a special team without informing the victims of how to access it. Many victims do not know that they are entitled to a second assessment. All of this information needs to be disseminated. Public security should hold public information sessions to provide more information to the victims, ”said the member for Saint-Jean.
“Several files are dragging on. Indeed, many disaster victims have not yet started work on their homes because they are awaiting a second assessment. I repeat, we are in November! It is unacceptable that after all these announcements from the ministry, the victims are still left to their own devices, ”the member for Iberville was surprised.
“We hope that the interpellation will have made the Minister and his team aware of the extent of the problems still experienced by the victims of the Montérégie. Every week, we receive calls from disaster victims waiting for government assistance. It is on their behalf that we appealed to the minister this morning. Now, we want to see results on the ground so that the victims finally regain their quality of life, ”concluded Dave Turcotte.
