Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu - &quot;The month of October is coming and the draft decree relating to a special intervention zone on the territories affected by the floods is still pending,&quot; said the member for Iberville. , Marie Bouillé. “The victims of last spring saw all the colors. They have neither the time nor the energy to endure administrative delays, ”she added.
“The absence of a decree means that the victims still have not had a permit to rebuild themselves. Fall has arrived this week and winter is just around the corner. We ask the minister to hurry, ”said official opposition spokesperson for municipal affairs, Daniel Ratthé.
“Every day, citizens awaiting a permit call my constituency office to obtain information about the draft decree. Unfortunately, at the minister&#39;s office, no one is able to give us a date for the adoption of the decree. Citizens are left in a vacuum of information and they are desperate, ”added the member for Iberville.
“There are still people who live in hotels or in trailers. At the rate things are going, they will not have time to rebuild themselves or make the necessary renovations to their homes before the frost. The citizens have suffered enough like that. The minister must reassure the victims, ”continued the MP for Saint-Jean, Dave Turcotte.
For the member for Chambly, Bertrand St-Arnaud, it is imperative that the municipalities are involved: “They need time to put everything in place and grant the permits. Like the population, they are getting impatient, with good reason. The Minister must immediately inform the population and the municipalities of the continuation of things, ”concluded the deputy.
