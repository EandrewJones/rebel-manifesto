Quebec - The deputy for Saint-Jean, Dave Turcotte, anxious to come to the concrete help of the victims of the Montérégie, announced this afternoon the establishment of a free day care service for the victims during the Grandes Corvées of the next weekends. This initiative was taken in conjunction with the childcare providers in the region and Famille à cœur.
“Since the start of the floods, the affected parents have been overwhelmed, the children are confused and need to change their minds. This is why we joined partners and with them we organized a day care service that will help parents during the two Grandes Corvées weekends, ”explained the member for Saint-Jean.
“The Montérégie region has been suffering for 38 days now. The extent of the damage is such that the victims no longer know where to start. By offering such a service, we believe that we will be able to give them a little help, allowing them to catch their breath and get back on top, ”continued Dave Turcotte.
“The service we are putting in place will be safe, supervised by childcare professionals and will be stimulating for the children who are also feeling the repercussions of this natural disaster. By offering them days of entertainment, animation, make-up, circus workshops and other surprises, we want to alleviate the stress they have been through lately, ”added the deputy.
“Other partners joined our initiative. The City of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu will provide a place and play areas free of charge to hold the event and Parents-Secours will ensure the security of the premises, ”he added.
Dave Turcotte was accompanied by Ms. Manon-Hélène Desjardins, Executive Director of Famille à coeur, Ms. Sandra Landry, owner of SOS responsible for childcare, Ms. Mélanie Dion, president of the Alliance des interveners en milieu familial, Ms. Chantal Robinson, Vice-president of the Alliance of Family Intervenors, and Ms. Lucie Lafond, Treasurer of the Alliance of Family Intervenors (ADIM-CSQ).
