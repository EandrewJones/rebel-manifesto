Bécancour - While in the riding of Nicolet-Bécancour, the Premier of Quebec and leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, along with the candidate Jean-René Dubois, recalled that her government has delivered the goods, as shown by the results already known by the Center-du-Québec and Mauricie Economic Diversification Fund.
“When we made the courageous but difficult decision to shut down the nuclear power plant, we promised people in the Mauricie and Center-du-Québec regions that we would not let them down. We have kept our promise, ”said the Premier.
To date, $ 25 million has been invested in projects - announced or in the process of being announced - which have generated investments of $ 132 million and created 649 jobs.
The Parti Québécois government has placed its trust in local players and entrepreneurs to ensure the prosperity of their region. To support job creation, it has also set up an economic diversification fund of $ 200 million over 5 years.
“Since 2009, the Liberals knew that overhauling and maintaining Gentilly-2 came at astronomical costs, but they chose to turn a blind eye. If we want to meet the challenges in Quebec, we must be determined. We decided to support Center-du-Québec and Mauricie in diversifying their economy. The results are there and it is the workers and their families who benefit from them, ”added Pauline Marois.
“Here is an eloquent demonstration of our &#39;masters and prosperous among us&#39;. We have the best economic team, we have strong and honest candidates to represent the citizens of Nicolet-Bécancour and Trois-Rivières, and we have a plan to create jobs throughout the territory, ”concluded the leader of the Parti Québécois.
