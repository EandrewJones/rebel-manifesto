Terrebonne - The Minister for Tourism, Mr. Pascal Bérubé, the President of the CRÉ de Lanaudière, Mr. Gaétan Morin, and the President of Tourisme Lanaudière, Ms. Évangéline Richard, are proud to draw up a very positive assessment of the Development Fund of the Lanaudière tourist offer (2008-2013).
In total, the Fund has contributed to the realization of 20 tourism projects for a total investment of nearly $ 16.6 million thanks to funding of $ 1.3 million. The leverage effect is all the more interesting since each dollar granted has generated $ 12 in investments in the development of the regional tourism offer. Among these projects, let us mention that the last seven accepted share a sum of $ 564,969. This financial assistance breaks down as follows:
“I would like to salute the work accomplished by Tourism Lanaudière, the investment results are extremely positive for regional tourism development, all over the region. Lanaudière&#39;s tourist offer is diversifying, improving and changing, to the benefit of more and more visitors to discover this beautiful region, ”said Minister Bérubé.
“We are particularly proud of the structuring nature of the projects selected. Their achievement will significantly improve the tourism infrastructure of Lanaudière, ”declared the president of the CRÉ de Lanaudière, Mr. Gaétan Morin.
“The projects supported will make it possible to diversify the tourist offer and improve the quality of the infrastructures already in place in order to make the Lanaudière region even more competitive. Consequently, these projects will undoubtedly have an impact on the increase in tourists and tourism revenues, ”concluded the president of Tourisme Lanaudière, Ms. Évangéline Richard.
It should be remembered that the Lanaudière Tourism Supply Development Fund aims to concentrate investments in the tourism industry based on regional priorities and to strengthen the role of partners in this process.
