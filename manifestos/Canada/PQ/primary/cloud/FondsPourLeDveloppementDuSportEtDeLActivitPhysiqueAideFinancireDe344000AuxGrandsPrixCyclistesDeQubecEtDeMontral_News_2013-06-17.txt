Quebec - The member for Labelle and parliamentary assistant for Sport and Leisure, Mr. Sylvain Pagé, announced today, on behalf of the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Ms. Marie Malavoy, the attribution of financial assistance of $ 344,000 intended to support the organization and presentation of the 2013 Grand Prix Cyclistes de Québec and Montréal.
“The Grands Prix Cyclistes are a great showcase for athletes and cycling. For the cities of Quebec and Montreal, thanks to the televising of the events in several countries, this is an exceptional business card, ”said MP Pagé.
Remember that the Support Program for International or Pan-Canadian Sporting Events has an annual envelope of $ 4 million per year. The government thus wishes to promote the holding of high-level sports competitions and consolidate Québec&#39;s expertise in the organization of major events.
“These athletes are the elite of the new generation of cyclists. They are role models for many young people whom they follow in their wake. I am convinced that events like these exert a positive influence on the population to whom they make them want to be physically active, ”commented Minister Malavoy.
