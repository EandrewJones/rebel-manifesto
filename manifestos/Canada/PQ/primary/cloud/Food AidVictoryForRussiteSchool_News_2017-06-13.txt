Quebec - The official opposition spokesperson for education, research, school perseverance and literacy, Alexandre Cloutier, is delighted that the Minister of Education has finally agreed to maintain food aid for underprivileged schools in Quebec. “It&#39;s clearly a victory, a step in the right direction.

IN SHORT
“Academic success begins with ensuring that students who come to class have a full stomach. This cut by the Liberal government was completely insane and it had no choice but to reverse it. However, we will ensure that the new amounts announced by the Minister are sufficient to meet the needs in all regions of Quebec. It is to the real impact on the ground that we will pay particular attention, ”said Alexandre Cloutier.
“We had to work harder to make the government listen to reason. I would like to thank my fellow members of the Parti Québécois from Lanaudière, Saguenay – Lac-Saint-Jean, Gaspésie and Bas-Saint-Laurent, who set to work, together, to convince the government not to cut in food aid. It is a great victory for the students of Quebec and for their success, and we are extremely proud to have fought this battle for them, ”concluded the MP.
