Québec - Stéphane Bergeron, MP for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, André Villeneuve, MP for Berthier and spokesperson for agriculture, and MP for Bourget et Porte - speech on immigration, Maka Kotto, note another failure of the Liberal government against Ottawa, while the Canadian Minister of Employment and Social Development, Pierre Poilievre, rebuked Sam Hamad after he mentioned federal openness to changes to the temporary foreign worker program.
“It is a bitter failure for the government of Philippe Couillard, which likes to imagine that the Canadian government is listening to it. The Liberal government has suffered setbacks after setbacks against the federal government and is in no way worried about Canada&#39;s lack of consideration of Quebec&#39;s interests, ”declared Stéphane Bergeron.
“The limits imposed by the Canadian government on foreign workers weaken the operations of several factories, particularly food processing, where recruitment difficulties make these workers essential. The majority of jobs in these factories are held by Quebeckers, and they risk losing their jobs if the companies fail to maintain production at 100% of their capacity. The Canadian government is directly attacking businesses that create jobs in Quebec, ”continued André Villeneuve.
“What are the Liberals going to do now so that these workers can continue to help keep these factories running? An independent Quebec could itself establish the rules governing the hiring of temporary foreign workers and would not be at the mercy of the ideological positions of the Conservative government of Stephen Harper, ”concluded Maka Kotto.
