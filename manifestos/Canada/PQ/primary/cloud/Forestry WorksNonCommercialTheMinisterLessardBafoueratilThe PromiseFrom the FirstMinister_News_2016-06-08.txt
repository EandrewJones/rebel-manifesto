Quebec - The deputy for Bonaventure and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of forests, wildlife and parks, Sylvain Roy, finds it completely unacceptable that the Minister of Forests, Laurent Lessard, withhold 25% of the budget announced by Prime Minister Philippe Couillard for the execution of non-commercial silvicultural work.
“This is $ 151 million that had to be spent directly on the ground. The Minister of Forests retains 25%; that means a cut of $ 38 million. It breaks a promise made by the Prime Minister in February 2015. The sums withheld were already planned by the Ministry of Finance to ensure predictability for entrepreneurs. However, a few days before the start of the silvicultural work season, the government is reneging on its commitment, ”denounced the member for Bonaventure.
“In addition to causing job losses in forestry companies - which had planned to carry out the work according to the announced budgets - the $ 38 million cut will result in the waste of sums already invested in planning in 2015. Minister Lessard must immediately release these amounts, in order to ensure the smooth running of the silvicultural work and not to compromise planning for the years to come, ”concluded Sylvain Roy.
