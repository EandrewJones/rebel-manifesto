Quebec - The Premier and Minister responsible for youth issues, Pauline Marois, announced the award of a grant to the organization Exeko for the deployment of two of its youth programs in the city of Montreal and in the three indigenous communities of Wemotaci, Kitcisakik and Kanesatake. The assistance of $ 35,000 will be paid by the Secrétariat à la jeunesse.
The community organization, which designs programs and projects aimed at fostering the development and inclusion of the most marginalized populations, aims to expand its idAction and Trickster programs. Already reaching more than 4,500 beneficiaries in 9 of the 17 administrative regions of Quebec, 80% of whom are young people excluded or at risk of exclusion, Exeko wants to reach 500 more young people and extend its reach to 11 regions of Quebec.
The assistance for idAction ($ 15,000) and Trickster ($ 20,000) will also be used to prepare for expansion throughout Quebec. Both programs target autonomy and the well-being of participants, in addition to stimulating the engagement of young people in their living environment.
&quot;It is with pleasure that I announce this substantial assistance to support youth programs that wish to make every young Quebecer a full citizen, regardless of their region, their interests or their academic abilities,&quot; declared the Premier.
The idAction program is a socio-educational program for people aged 15 to 35, marginalized or at risk of exclusion. As for Trickster, it is a program of social and cultural activities dedicated to Aboriginal youth aged 8 to 16.
The Youth Secretariat&#39;s mandate is to advise the government on youth matters and to assist the Premier in exercising her responsibilities in this regard. It coordinates and monitors government action in this area.
