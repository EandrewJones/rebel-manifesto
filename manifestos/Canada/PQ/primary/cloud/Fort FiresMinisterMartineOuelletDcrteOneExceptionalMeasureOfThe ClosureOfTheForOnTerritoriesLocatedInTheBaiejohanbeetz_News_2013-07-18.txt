Quebec - The Minister of Natural Resources, Ms. Martine Ouellet, announces that the forest is now closed on a territory located 40 km east of Havre-Saint-Pierre and 10 km west of Aguanish. The targeted sector, which forms a rectangle, is delimited more precisely as follows: to the northwest by latitude 50 ° 52 &#39;30&#39; &#39;and longitude 63 ° 05&#39;, to the northeast by latitude 50 ° 52 &#39;30&#39; &#39;and longitude 62 ° 15&#39;, to the southeast by latitude 50 ° 15 &#39;and longitude 62 ° 15&#39; and, along the coast, to the southwest by latitude 50 ° 16 &#39;46&#39; &#39;and longitude 63 ° 05&#39;. However, this territory excludes the perimeter of the immediate community of Baie-Johan-Beetz secured by the Society for the Protection of Forests Against Fire (SOPFEU).
The location map of the affected territory is available on the Department&#39;s website at the following address: www.mrn.gouv.qc.ca/fr/feux-foret.
This is a territory that is usually not closed. However, the current situation leads to exceptional measures. That is why the Minister of Natural Resources made this decision in the interest of human safety. Traffic on provincial roads remains the responsibility of the Ministère des Transports or the Sûreté du Québec.
“In this period when the flammability indices are extreme in certain areas of Quebec, the greatest caution is in order. Everyone&#39;s collaboration is essential for the protection of citizens, ”Minister Martine Ouellet reminded us.
