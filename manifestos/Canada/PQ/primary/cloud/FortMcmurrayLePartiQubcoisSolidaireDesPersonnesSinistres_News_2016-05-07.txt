Quebec - The member for Jonquière and interim leader of the parliamentary wing of the Parti Québécois, Sylvain Gaudreault, expressed his solidarity with the many people affected by the Fort McMurray tragedy.
“On behalf of the Parti Québécois, I express all my compassion and my support for the victims of this major natural disaster. Our thoughts are with the displaced Alberta families, who had to leave their homes quickly, worried for their possessions, their jobs, their memories and their future. I also have a thought for all the workers in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada who earn their living in Fort McMurray. I would like to thank the firefighters, police officers, paramedics and other members of the emergency services who support the population in these difficult times for their dedication. I am convinced that the generosity of Quebecers, already tested in their history by natural disasters, will be there to support the people of Alberta, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
