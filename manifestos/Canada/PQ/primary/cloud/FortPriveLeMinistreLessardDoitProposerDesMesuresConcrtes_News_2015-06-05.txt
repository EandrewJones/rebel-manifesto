Quebec– The MP for Bonaventure and official opposition spokesperson for forests, Sylvain Roy, denounces the lack of support from the Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, Laurent Lessard, to Quebec forest owners. Yesterday, in front of the delegates gathered on the occasion of the annual congress of the Federation of forest producers of Quebec, in Saint-Georges, he urged the minister to announce concrete measures promoting the economy of the private forest.
“The Minister must go from words to action and propose support measures for the 130,000 lot owners and 35,000 forest producers in all regions of Quebec. The already difficult business environment is worsened by the austerity measures imposed by the Liberal government. Among other things, the abolition of the forest job creation program and the silvicultural investment program hit foresters hard. However, they urgently need investment to create jobs in the regions of Quebec, ”said Sylvain Roy.
The spokesperson does not understand that the minister is asking private foresters to produce more timber for delivery, while reducing their budgets by nearly 30%. “There is a total inconsistency between the effort required of foresters and the support given to them. How could they do more with less? Government assistance must take into account the reality of forest producers, for whom the context is difficult. However, with the cuts it is currently imposing, the Liberal government is doing exactly the opposite, ”concluded the member for Bonaventure.
