Quebec, November 1, 2016 - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for forests, Sylvain Roy, deplores that the Forum Innovation Bois, which was held yesterday in Rivière du Loup, did not lead to anything new for the forestry economics.
“In 2013, the Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, held the Rendez-vous national de la forêt québécoise, in the presence of all stakeholders from the forest sector. Three major projects had been set up, and investments of $ 675 million had been announced. The Liberal government, when it came to power, threw everything in the trash and now, two and a half years later, it is not announcing anything new. It is frankly disappointing for those involved in the forestry sector, ”said Sylvain Roy.
Private forests The spokesperson also deplores that nothing of what was announced yesterday affects the 130,000 owners of private forests. “The government completely neglects the private forest. The conclusion of yesterday&#39;s Forum proves it once again, ”he added.
Timber Charter “With this government, the forestry sector has already lost two and a half years. The announcements from the Wood Innovation Forum show that the Liberals have still not developed a vision for this area of activity. A good idea would be to start by re-establishing the Timber Charter, which was supported by all stakeholders and which represented a real innovation, ”concluded Sylvain Roy.
