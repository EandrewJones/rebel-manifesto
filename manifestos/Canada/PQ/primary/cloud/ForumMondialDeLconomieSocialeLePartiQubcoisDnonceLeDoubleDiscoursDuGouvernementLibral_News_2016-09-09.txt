Montreal, September 9, 2016 - While the Liberal government is praising the merits of the social economy, the member for Rimouski and Parti Québécois spokesperson for seniors and social economy, Harold LeBel, denounces the granting, by the Laval Integrated Health and Social Services Center, of a million dollar contract to a private company to provide home care.
“The private sector gives lower wages to employees who provide home care. Is it acceptable that most of the time, we offer the attendants who take care of our seniors at home lower wages, while allowing private companies to make a profit? The $ 242 million in cuts to the health and social services network, imposed by Gaétan Barrette, are forcing institutions to make choices that may compromise the quality of care and services offered to patients; this is unacceptable, ”said the spokesperson.
“The Liberals are saying one thing and doing the opposite: the 2015-2020 government action plan in the social economy provided for measures to encourage social economy enterprises to participate more actively in public procurement calls for tenders. However, it is exactly the opposite that occurs. Despite everything, the Liberals dare to come to the World Social Economy Forum, claiming to contribute to it, while they are harming it with their austerity measures, ”continued the Member for Rimouski.
“The World Social Economy Forum was nonetheless a success! In addition, its outfit in Montreal allowed Quebec to shine. History proves it: the Parti Québécois has always been the party of the social economy in Quebec. And so it will be in the future as well, ”concluded Harold LeBel.
