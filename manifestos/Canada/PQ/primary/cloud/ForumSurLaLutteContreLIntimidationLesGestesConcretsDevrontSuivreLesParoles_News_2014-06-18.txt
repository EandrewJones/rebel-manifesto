Quebec - Mathieu Traversy, the member for Terrebonne and official opposition critic for the family and the fight against bullying, welcomes the forthcoming holding of a forum on the fight against bullying and wishes to mention that &#39;&#39; he will be there to ensure that the voices of the public and those who have experienced bullying are heard. They are calling for measures, and the member assures them of his collaboration and vigilance so that concrete actions are taken.
“I intend to participate actively in the discussions of the upcoming forum. The question is important; that is why I invite the public to share their opinions. Bullying affects everyone, at all ages, in the real world as in the virtual world, and it is undoubtedly a scourge that must be tackled collectively, ”said Mathieu Traversy.
“Real consultation between the population, organizations and stakeholders is beneficial; it must still quickly lead to tangible measures after the forum, he continued. My colleagues and I will therefore be particularly vigilant so that actions follow the word and reflection, and so that resources are rapidly deployed in all regions of Quebec. &quot;
The forum will take place on October 2, 2014 and will bring together all the partners involved in the fight against bullying, in addition to the ministries concerned. The population will also be called upon to enrich the work.
