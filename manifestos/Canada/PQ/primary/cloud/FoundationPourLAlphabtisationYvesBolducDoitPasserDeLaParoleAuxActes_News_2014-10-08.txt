Quebec - The member for Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, asks the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports , Yves Bolduc, to go beyond words and provide the necessary funding to avoid the closure of the Literacy Foundation.
“After his unfortunate statement on school books and libraries, the Minister of Education wanted to be forgiven. On September 8, during an award ceremony for International Literacy Day, he underlined the vital importance of the Foundation. Informed of his financial difficulties, he then undertook to release the funding and pay it before September 30. Yves Bolduc today met the representatives of the Foundation but, obviously, they are leaving Quebec without any guarantee, ”lamented Dave Turcotte.
The spokesperson recalls that the Foundation helps 10,000 people a year to overcome illiteracy. She is leading this fight by relying on the voluntary help of several personalities who recognize the importance of the problem. The Foundation also set up the “Reading as a Gift” program, which donated 40,000 books to underprivileged children and families.
“Minister Yves Bolduc reiterated his commitment to the National Assembly today. Despite this, nothing concrete was said or done. Can he walk the talk and confirm, in writing, the amount of funding and the date when it will be given to the Foundation? », Concluded the member for Saint-Jean.
