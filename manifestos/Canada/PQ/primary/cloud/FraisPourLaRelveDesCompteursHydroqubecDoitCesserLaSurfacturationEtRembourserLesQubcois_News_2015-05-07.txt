Quebec - The member for Marie-Victorin and official opposition critic for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, calls on the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Pierre Arcand, to demand that Hydro-Québec to stop imposing meter reading fees on 2.9 million residential customers who now have smart meters that automatically transmit their consumption data.
“Hydro-Quebec demanded the installation of smart meters for all Quebecers. The main advantage of these meters is precisely that they do not require any manual reading. However, the Crown corporation continues to impose succession fees on all of its clients; in just one year, this measure enabled it to raise $ 67 million. The government must put an end to this unfair overbilling and demand that Hydro-Quebec reimburse Quebeckers for the $ 67 million they overpaid, ”asked Bernard Drainville.
“It gets even worse: customers who have chosen the withdrawal option - those who have said no to the new meters - must pay Hydro-Québec an additional fee of $ 5 per month to ensure manual reading. However, these customers are already paying for this service! In fact, everyone must pay $ 0.40 per day for the subscription fee, regardless of their consumption. These fixed costs include $ 0.06 for meter reading. It is clearly double billing, ”added the spokesperson.
“In addition, we have never seen so many Quebecers having difficulty paying their Hydro-Quebec bill. This year, 300,000 customers have to enter into a payment agreement, a sad record. The first thing to do is to stop making them pay twice. This overbilling must stop, ”concluded the member for Marie-Victorin.
