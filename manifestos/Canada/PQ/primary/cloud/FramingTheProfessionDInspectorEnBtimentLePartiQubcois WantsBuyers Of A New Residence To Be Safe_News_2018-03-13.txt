Québec, March 13, 2018 - As part of the study of the bill amending the Building Act, the official opposition spokesperson for labor, Guy Leclair, asked the Minister responsible for des consommateurs et de l&#39;Habitation, Lise Thériault, to include provisions to better protect buyers of a new home against poor inspection diagnoses. During a press briefing on this subject, Mr. Leclair was accompanied by Mario Roy, president of the Corporation of property quality inspectors (CIVQP). Together, they demanded the supervision of the profession of home inspector.
IN SHORT
“Minister Thériault today has the opportunity to act to better protect buyers of a new home. While British Columbia and Alberta have already legislated to regulate the profession of home inspector by making the permit to practice compulsory, and Ontario is preparing to follow suit, the government of Philippe Couillard he locks himself in an awkward silence, ”said Guy Leclair.
In Quebec, more than 6 in 10 people call on a building inspector before concluding the purchase of a new property. “As legislators, we must regulate this profession. Right now, anyone can call themselves a home inspector; the risks of being duped are very real, as much for buyers as for sellers. At this stage of the buying process, the most important thing is trust. A Parti Québécois government would immediately take the means to guarantee the reliability of the inspections, ”he continued.
“Legislating always seems a painful and insurmountable process, until a framework is actually put in place and becomes natural. Today, there remains one last weak link to tackle in the process of buying and selling properties: that of the building inspection. We want inspectors to work according to clear and rigorous standards, ”concluded Mario Roy.
