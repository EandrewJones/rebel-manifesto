Quebec - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for education, Alexandre Cloutier, as well as the spokesperson responsible for the Charter of the French language, Maka Kotto, are calling on the government to back down and reverse the cuts in Quebec. francization to prevent the children of immigrants from being penalized in their learning of French.
In fact, we learned this morning that the budgetary rules of the school boards are about to be approved by the Conseil du trésor, which will formalize the maintenance of the cuts in francization for the next school year.
“In some school boards, 40% of the francization budget is soaring because of the cuts. These sums were used to help newcomers to master French and thus provide them with the basic tool allowing them to successfully integrate into Quebec society. Once again, the government is blindly cutting an essential service for students, ”said the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
&quot;We have a premier who is juggling the idea of increasing the number of immigrants received in Quebec to 60,000 each year, when he is not even able to guarantee access to francization courses. to allophone students in our schools at the moment. The government prefers to drastically cut the budgets for francization courses. It is inconceivable, paradoxical, even absurd! », Added Maka Kotto.
“While the number of allophone students is steadily increasing in our schools, the government has decided to cut the first factor in the integration and success of these students: francization! This government is completely disconnected and it continues its long series of cuts in direct services to students. It is simply endangering the future of these neo-Quebecers, ”concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
