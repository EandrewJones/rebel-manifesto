Quebec - In light of Tony Accurso&#39;s testimony to the Commission of Inquiry into the Awarding and Management of Public Contracts in the Construction Industry, the member for Verchères and official opposition critic for ethics and integrity, Stéphane Bergeron, finds very disturbing the allegations according to which a check for $ 250,000 would have been given to a company in order to help Jacques Duchesneau to cover the deficit of his electoral campaign for mayor of Montreal, in 1998.
“In 2012, François Legault claimed to have verified the probity of all his candidates. What about his former star candidate and integrity spokesperson? These serious allegations tarnish the integrity and credibility of Jacques Duchesneau. This episode raises doubts about the judgment and vigilance of François Legault. The head of the CAQ must tell Quebeckers what checks were carried out at the time and what the conclusions were. This is an extremely worrying situation. Quebeckers need to know who, Mr. Accurso or Mr. Duchesneau, is telling the truth, ”said Stéphane Bergeron.
