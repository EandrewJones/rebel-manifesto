Quebec City - Verchères MP and spokeswoman for the official opposition on ethics and integrity, Stéphane Bergeron, and Taillon MP and health and accessibility spokesperson, Diane Lamarre , note that the Minister of Health and Social Services, Gaétan Barrette, would have the same laissez-faire and would do the same as his Liberal predecessors in the McGill University Health Center (MUHC) case, involving Dr. Arthur Porter.
“An investigator from the Marteau squad, however, described to the Charbonneau commission this week the MUHC scandal as being the biggest corruption fraud in Canadian history. Current Education Minister Yves Bolduc said the project was flawless. The Minister of Health agrees with him, according to his statements this morning to the National Assembly, ”said Stéphane Bergeron.
“Quebecers already make a significant contribution to their health system. The MUHC scandal cost citizens tens of millions of dollars. The minister was not even able to recognize that the Liberal government&#39;s lack of vigilance deprived them of money that could have been used to improve access to services and care, ”added Diane Lamarre.
Minister Barrette added some by indicating: &quot;And, as regards what happened in the past, the past has been done well, I said it earlier, and we will do it again. in the same spirit. &quot;
“Considering the MUHC&#39;s disaster in terms of integrity and public finances, it is rather absurd that the Minister considers that everything has been done according to the rules of the art, suggesting that the same way of doing things will be applied to the to come up. It is both surprising and disturbing to hear Mr. Barrette&#39;s answers to our questions. We sincerely hope that the government will show more rigor in the management of all projects, so that no other scandal of this magnitude will emerge under the Couillard government, ”concluded the deputies.
