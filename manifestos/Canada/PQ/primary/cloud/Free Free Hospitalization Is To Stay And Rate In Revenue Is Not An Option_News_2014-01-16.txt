Quebec - “I want to reassure the population: free hospitalization is here to stay and room pricing based on income is not an option. This is what the Minister of Health and Social Services, Dr. Réjean Hébert, said today, who took stock, while he is currently abroad, concerning the billing of hospital rooms.
“Accessibility and universality of health care is a fundamental principle of our health system in Quebec. Therefore, it is essential that there be an offer of free rooms in hospitals and this will continue to be the case, including for new establishments currently under construction, such as the CHUM and the MUHC ”, continued the Minister Hébert.
Changes have been taking place in health establishments in Quebec in recent years where, for health reasons such as reducing the risk of nosocomial infection, the number of rooms for more than two people tends to decrease, in favor of a higher number of private and semi-private rooms. Currently, patients have free access to four-person rooms, but must pay if they wish to be in private and semi-private rooms, except on medical prescription. Changes in the configuration of the hospital environment require us to review our practices and to revise the circular on room pricing, which is becoming obsolete in the new context, in order to ensure the principle of free access. The establishment of a committee to study the issue of billing for hospital rooms is aimed at precisely this objective.
“The working group will examine the issue, analyze examples from elsewhere and propose scenarios that will both ensure the maintenance of accessibility to health care, including hospitalization, by more to ensure equity between the various hospitals in Quebec. Certainly, income-based pricing is not among the acceptable scenarios. Whatever pricing model is chosen, our priority is to maintain the supply of free rooms and to respect the choice of patients, ”the Minister concluded.
