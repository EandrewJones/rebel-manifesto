Quebec– Sylvain Pagé, the member for Labelle and official opposition spokesperson for recreation and sports, joins his voice to that of the 181 Quebec personalities who are worried about the future of the festivities surrounding the National Day; in turn, he is asking the government to renounce the 20% cuts that it plans to impose on the budgets dedicated to the organization of national day celebrations.
“The national holiday is an opportunity to show our sense of belonging, it is the link that unites the citizens of Quebec, beyond generations, beyond all origins, to - beyond political allegiances. Weakening our national holiday therefore undoubtedly means reducing our ability to show who we are collectively, and this aspect is fundamental when the time comes to welcome new Quebecers, ”said Sylvain Pagé.
“The Government of Quebec must commit to maintaining the unique, civic and non-mercantile character of our national holiday. Pride has no cash value. It is an individual and collective phenomenon maintained by the generations of Quebecers who built our nation. Our government must ensure that the budgets dedicated to Quebec&#39;s national holiday are preserved, that is its duty. I offer him, moreover, all my collaboration so that we, with all the partners, find sustainable solutions that will ensure the financing of the National Day for the years to come, ”added the Member for Labelle.
