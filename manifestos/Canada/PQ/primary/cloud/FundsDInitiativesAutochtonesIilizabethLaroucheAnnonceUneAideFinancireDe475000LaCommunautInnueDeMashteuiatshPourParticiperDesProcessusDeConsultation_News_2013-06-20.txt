Quebec - The Minister for Native Affairs, Ms. Élizabeth Larouche, announces a grant of $ 475,000 to the Innu community of Mashteuiatsh, the Pekuakamiulnuatsh Takuhikan, so that it can participate in important consultations initiated by the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks.
“In order to establish a relationship that is constructive and focused on partnership, the government has adopted mutually satisfactory consultation mechanisms with the communities. These should also be used to identify the concerns that indigenous communities may have, ”said the Minister.
The financial assistance granted will make it possible to hold consultations on various projects related to energy, mines, territories, wildlife and forests. Some consultations are directly related to the Rivière-du-Moulin, Seigneurie de Beaupré and Saint-Gédéon wind farm projects, as well as the hydroelectric development project for the 11th fall of the Mistassini River.
&quot;The Pekuakamiulnuatsh wish to be an integral part of major economic development projects in Quebec, it is essential that the community of Mashteuiatsh be a partner in the development of natural resources,&quot; added Denis Trottier, Member of Parliament for Roberval.
This is the fifth year that financial assistance has been renewed for the community of Mashteuiatsh, through the Native Initiatives Fund II of the Secrétariat aux affaires autochtones (SAA). This fund provides funding for the participation of Indigenous nations or communities in the consultation processes initiated by the Government of Quebec, to the tune of $ 20 million over five years. The objective of this envelope is to facilitate the application of the constitutional obligation, which is incumbent on the Government of Quebec, to consult the Aboriginal communities. The Indigenous Initiatives Fund helps support projects that have positive spinoffs in Indigenous communities.
