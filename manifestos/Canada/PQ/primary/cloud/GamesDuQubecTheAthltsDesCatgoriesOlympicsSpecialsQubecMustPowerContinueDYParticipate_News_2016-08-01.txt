Quebec - The member for Labelle and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of sports and recreation, Sylvain Pagé, asks the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Sébastien Proulx, to offer all the necessary support to Sports Quebec so that the “Special Olympics Quebec” (OSQ) categories, intended for young people with physical or intellectual disabilities, are not withdrawn from the programming of the Quebec Games, starting in 2018.
“Minister Proulx must intervene and ensure that our young athletes with disabilities can continue to participate in the Quebec Games. Their inclusion in this great multisport event is important; this allows them to strengthen their self-confidence and self-esteem, to demonstrate their will and to promote their social integration. Taking part in the Quebec Games is an extraordinary reward for young people, whether they are disabled or not. The experience is invariably rewarding for everyone, ”explained the member for Labelle.
“Everyone agrees that it is essential to send a message of openness and inclusion to all young Quebecers, including those living with an intellectual or physical disability. However, by excluding certain athletes from the Quebec Games, we are doing exactly the opposite. The minister must encourage these young people. For them, the adventure of the Games is synonymous with hope and is a great source of motivation, ”concluded Sylvain Pagé.
