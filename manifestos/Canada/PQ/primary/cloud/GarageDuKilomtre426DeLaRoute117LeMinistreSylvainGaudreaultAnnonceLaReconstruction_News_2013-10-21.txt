Val-d&#39;Or– The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announced today, along with the Minister for Native Affairs and Member of Parliament for Abitibi-Est, Ms. Élizabeth Larouche, and the MNA for Rouyn-Noranda-Témiscamingue, Mr. Gilles Chapadeau, the reconstruction of a garage of the Ministry of Transport located at kilometer 426 of route 117 in the La Vérendrye wildlife reserve.
The new garage will have an area of 652 m2 and will be equipped with facilities for the storage and maintenance of snow removal vehicles used on route 117 between Louvicourt and the middle of the La Vérendrye wildlife reserve. In addition to the vehicle drop-off area, the new building will include a storage room, a mechanical room and a room for installing a generator.
“The safety of road users is a priority for the Ministère des Transports. That is why everything has been done to ensure that the reconstruction work on the new garage at kilometer 426 is carried out as quickly as possible. Although efforts have been made to ensure that the contractor can continue to carry out his work using temporary installations, these will never replace modern permanent installations, ”said Minister Gaudreault.
