Quebec - The member for Terrebonne and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in family matters, Mathieu Traversy, is upset by the words of the Minister of Families, Francine Charbonneau, who admitted not to worry about the fact that the parents of the Quebec are gradually turning their backs on childcare centers, because, for her, whether a childcare service is regulated or not, &quot;it&#39;s the same thing&quot;.
&quot;The same, really?&quot; Does the minister know that 76% of the complaints received at the department relate to a private daycare center, and that this percentage is increasing? Non-subsidized private daycares alone are at the origin of 42% of complaints made in Quebec, while they provide 19% of available places. I invite Francine Charbonneau to learn more; several studies show that the quality of services is superior in childcare centers, and that the educational program provided there contributes positively to children&#39;s development. With regard to private daycares, particularly those which are not regulated, it is rather the opposite: no study makes their apology ”, declared the spokesperson.
The MP recalls that private non-subsidized daycare centers have been the scene of the vast majority of cases of abuse and neglect reported in the media recently. “Unfortunately, when it comes to non-subsidized childcare, there is no guarantee of quality; these daycare centers are not subject to the same rules as subsidized daycare services, among other things in terms of accountability to the Ministry of the Family, ”he added.
“In April 2014, the Liberals began to discredit and dismantle the network of childcare centers, despite the fact that this model is one of the greatest successes in Quebec. It is completely incomprehensible; we are envious of this network all over the world! I would very much like Minister Charbonneau to explain to me and to parents in Quebec why she and her government are acting this way, ”concluded Mathieu Traversy.
