Quebec - The Parti Québécois salutes the determination of several citizens and municipal officials who went to Pennsylvania last weekend to better understand the effects of shale gas exploitation.
“Their findings are worrying: contamination of water and wells, depreciation of the value of houses, harmfulness of silica, archaic exploitation. In short, there are many reasons that amply justify that here in Quebec, we make the right decisions and, in this sense, hydraulic fracturing must be prohibited, ”declared the member for Vachon and spokesperson for the official opposition in mining and shale gas, Martine Ouellet.
The Parti Québécois considers that current technology is not developed. Citizens who traveled to Pennsylvania were able to learn that horizontal wells can now reach a length of 4 km, instead of the 1 km advertised here. In addition, several groundwater wells were contaminated during vertical drilling. The risk is therefore great, even at the exploration stage.
“The technology is not there. The industry plays sorcerer&#39;s apprentice, has no control and experiments at the expense of the environment and citizens. The citizens of the St. Lawrence Plain are not and do not want to become laboratory rats, ”added the MP.
For more than a year, the Parti Québécois has been calling for a complete moratorium on the exploration and exploitation of shale gas. “With everything we have learned over the past year, we too, as in France, must ban hydraulic fracturing. The Charest government must, by the adjournment of parliamentary proceedings in December, present a bill to this effect, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
