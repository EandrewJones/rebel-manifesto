Montreal - “It is scandalous to hear Gaétan Barrette affirm that he prioritizes family medicine when he has denigrated family doctors in recent years. To be Minister of Health, you need more than speaking out loud. You have to be a unifier and not a chicane specialist like Gaétan Barrette, ”said the Parti Québécois candidate in the riding of Saint-François and former dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Sherbrooke, Dr. Réjean Hébert.
Remember that a little over a year ago, Mr. Barrette aroused the ire of general practitioners by claiming that there was no shortage of family physicians in Quebec and by taking a position in a negotiation. between general practitioners and government.
“To improve access, we must offer more support to family physicians by completing the network of family medicine groups and equipping them with other professionals such as nutritionists, respiratory therapists, psychosocial workers and nurses as proposed by the Parti Québécois. We must also continue to computerize the health network in order to improve the productivity of family physicians, ”added Réjean Hébert.
“The first line must be improved, strengthened and better organized. This must be done in collaboration with family physicians and all health professionals and not in confrontation with them as Gaétan Barrette usually does, ”said the Parti Québécois candidate in Saint-François.
In addition, Réjean Hébert made a point of showing his willingness to participate in a public debate with his Caquist and liberal opponents. “Health is of great concern to Quebecers. Several visions clash and our fellow citizens must be able to know what the different parties are proposing. I would be very happy to be able to present the vision of the Parti Québécois during a debate, ”concluded Réjean Hébert.
