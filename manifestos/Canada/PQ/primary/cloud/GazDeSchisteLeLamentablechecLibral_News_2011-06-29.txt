Quebec - The MNA for Vachon and official opposition critic for environment, sustainable development, parks and water, Martine Ouellet, and the MNA for L&#39;Assomption and critic for mines , Scott McKay, call on the Liberal government to show humility in the face of the public by acknowledging its failure in handling the shale gas issue. “The withdrawal of one of the gas companies from the committee formed to carry out the strategic environmental assessment on this sector is irrefutable proof that the entire process put in place by the Liberal government is corrupt. We have to start from scratch! », Said Martine Ouellet.
Moreover, the departure of the representative of Junex from this committee clearly shows that the very composition of this evaluation group is lacking. “There were two gas companies on this expert committee. If Junex pulls out to lend credibility to the ongoing process, the other gas company, Talisman, should do the same. Since the announcement of a strategic environmental assessment last March, we have asked that environmental groups and citizens&#39; committees be present. It&#39;s an opportunity to give them the place they deserve, ”said Scott McKay.
The Liberal government is going from wrong to wrong on the shale gas issue. “The comedy of errors has gone on long enough! The concerns of the population are legitimate. Thousands of people have been mobilizing for months. The government must stop listening only to gas companies and finally make the will of the population its line of conduct. A big boost is needed, ”continued the mining spokesperson.
“The Parti Québécois is offering the government concrete solutions to redress the situation. We must now decree a complete moratorium on the exploration and exploitation of shale gas and involve the Office of public hearings on the environment in the strategic environmental assessment process in order to make it rigorous and transparent ”, concluded the member for Vachon.
