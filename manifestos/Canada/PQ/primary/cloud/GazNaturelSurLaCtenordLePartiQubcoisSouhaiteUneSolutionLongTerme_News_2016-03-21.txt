Quebec - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of northern development, Lorraine Richard, is disappointed with the announcement made this morning in Port-Cartier by the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Pierre Arcand. If the pilot project to convert the ArcelorMittal plant to natural gas represents a first step, the MP wants firmer commitments from the government to serve the entire region.
“Unfortunately, I cannot be happy with this morning&#39;s announcement. Yes, with this pilot project, ArcelorMittal will produce less greenhouse gases, but the good news ends there. This project means an annual increase of more than a hundred trucks on Route 138, and I am sure that no North Shore wants that, ”said the Member for Duplessis.
For many years, elected officials from the Côte-Nord have denounced the dismal condition of Route 138 and the lack of investment by the government to improve it. The addition of more than a hundred trucks per year will contribute to the deterioration of the roadway and the increase in heavy traffic, which has only increased since the launch of the Romaine project.
“This solution can only be temporary. For years, the Côte-Nord has been asking for natural gas service. The industries present need it to reduce their costs and GHG emissions, but we want it above all to attract businesses that work in transformation, in order to develop our economy. Unfortunately, I am not seeing any firm commitment from this government in this sector, ”concluded the member.
