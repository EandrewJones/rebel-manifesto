Longueuil, July 23, 2014 - Diane Lamarre, the member for Taillon and official opposition spokesperson for health and access to care, invited the population to participate in the mobilization orchestrated by Mai Duong on stem cell donation. She thanks all those who answered the call, while recalling that a compatible donor has not yet been found.
“While usually over a full year, 2,500 people register with the Stem Cell Donor Registry, Ms. Duong&#39;s action has resulted in Héma-Québec obtaining 1,637 registrations in just twenty days. of which 50% were from people of Asian descent, compared to 0.5% to date. As always, Quebecers have shown great generosity, but we must continue to mobilize, ”said Diane Lamarre.
Global donor banks are not diversified enough. Most of those registered are mostly Caucasian. It is a different reality for several other ethnic origins, such as Asians, Hispanics or black communities, who are underrepresented there. Mai Duong&#39;s action therefore makes an invaluable contribution, even beyond Quebec.
“There are three ways to donate stem cells. It can be done by puncture of bone marrow, by donating an umbilical cord in some hospitals or by apheresis. This is a technique which, after having stimulated the production of stem cells in the donor by a drug, allows their recovery ”, continued the Member of Parliament for Taillon.
“Mai Duong&#39;s approach touched all Quebecers. In the tumult of the working days, some may have postponed their registration in the Register. The vacation period is a perfect opportunity to appreciate the chance to be healthy and to take a few minutes that can save a life. It will also improve access to specialized care. This is another way of helping patients from here and elsewhere to increase their chances of survival, through a more complete bank of potential donors, ”concluded Diane Lamarre, while insisting on the fact that it is simple to register in the Register by going to the sitehema-quebec.qc.ca.
