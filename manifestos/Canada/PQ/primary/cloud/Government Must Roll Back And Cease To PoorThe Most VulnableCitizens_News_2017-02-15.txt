Quebec, February 15, 2017 - Harold LeBel, spokesperson for the Parti Québécois pour les Seniors, and Nicolas Marceau, spokesperson for finances, ask the Liberal government to listen to reason and not to deprive 500,000 seniors of 500 $ per year.
“All MPs have had phones from outraged seniors in their constituency offices demanding that the government back down because it doesn&#39;t make sense to go and dig $ 500 more out of their pockets. We have a Minister responsible for Seniors, Francine Charbonneau; she must carry their voice, she who knows all the groups that denounce this measure. Has the minister succeeded, in the last few hours, in convincing her colleague, Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, to forget this idea? Can she defend the elders? Asks Harold LeBel.
“The truth is that there are people who have long planned for their retirement taking into account the $ 500 to which they will no longer be entitled under the changes introduced in the budget by the Minister of Finance. It was he who changed the rules of the game, without warning. And there are people who, starting today, are going to get caught $ 500 a year for 5 years. This is the Liberal plan for seniors, ”added Nicolas Marceau.
“Taking $ 500 a year for 5 years from the most vulnerable people is what the Liberal government wants to do. This is unacceptable! Especially since during this time he continues to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to doctors. The least that can be said is that it does not have the priorities in the right places, ”concluded the deputies.
