Quebec - “The Action Plan unveiled this morning shows a certain improvisation on the part of the government, while the digital strategy itself has not yet been established. An action plan that is part of an undefined strategy, and for which consultations are still to come, leaves one perplexed as to the Minister&#39;s understanding of the digital economy, ”reacted Mireille Jean, Member of Parliament for Chicoutimi and Parti Québécois spokesperson for the digital economy, at the announcement made earlier today by the Liberal government.
“Although we welcome the government&#39;s interest in the digital economy - it was high time it took care of it - what it announced today is essentially that it will initiate this summer a &quot;co-creation process&quot; to develop its digital strategy, while it has been in power for two years, &quot;continued the MP.
“Obviously, the government does not seem to know where it is going; he himself admits that his action plan is in fact only an &quot;adaptable guide&quot; &quot;according to the evolution of the situation&quot; and that &quot;the expected results will be reviewed&quot;. Could it be even less precise? », Concluded Mireille Jean.
