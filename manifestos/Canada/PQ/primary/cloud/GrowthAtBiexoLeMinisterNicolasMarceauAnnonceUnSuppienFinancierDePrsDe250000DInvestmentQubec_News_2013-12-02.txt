Saint-Roch-de-l&#39;Achigan - The Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau, today announced that Investissement Québec has granted a loan of $ 242,500 to the company Biexo for a expansion of over $ 750,000. Biexo manufactures steel tanks, retention basins, workbenches and other parts for industrial customers.
&quot;Identifying a need, creating an innovative product and constantly seeking to improve the way you do things, this is the basis of entrepreneurship,&quot; said Minister Nicolas Marceau. When Biexo decided to acquire new facilities to improve its productivity, the government responded to the call with funding from Investissement Québec. These new facilities will enable the company to increase its competitiveness and create wealth in the region, with six new jobs ”.
Biexo is currently experiencing strong sales growth, and its cramped premises are limiting its growth and production capacity. The company therefore chose to build a new building near its old premises and to acquire new equipment.
&quot;This support has enabled us to complete the financial package for the construction of our new building, which will allow us to better meet the needs of our customers,&quot; said Guy Limoges, co-owner of Biexo.
Investissement Québec&#39;s mission is to promote the growth of investment in Québec, thereby contributing to economic development and job creation, in all regions. The Company provides businesses with a full range of financial solutions, including loans, loan guarantees and equity investments, to support them at all stages of their development. In addition, she is responsible for administering tax measures and prospecting for investments abroad.
