Quebec City, May 24, 2017 - The Parti Québécois labor spokesperson, Marc Bourcier, calls on the Liberal government to come out of its torpor and mandate a special mediator to lead negotiations in the construction sector.
IN SHORT
“A negotiated solution is always preferable; what the Liberal government must do today is show leadership and appoint a special mediator to speed up the conclusion of an agreement between the parties, so that the strike in the construction sector ends on as quickly as possible. Until now, Dominique Vien has remained invisible, although she has known for months what is in preparation. She knew the consequences of such a strike for the entire population, industry players and their families. Where has Dominique Vien been for the past six months? What did she do? “Asked Marc Bourcier.
“Today, the Minister of Labor announced that she will meet with all parties. Why has she not done it before, instead of brandishing the threat of a special law at one minute to midnight? As in many cases, it is now up to the Prime Minister to take matters into his own hands and once again make up for the absence of one of his ministers. We hope that it will be possible to reach a negotiated agreement, not an imposed settlement, ”added Mr. Bourcier.
“Industry leaders have a responsibility to find compromises to reach an agreement as quickly as possible. They must avoid putting their fate in the hands of this government, ”concluded the deputy.
