Quebec, December 21, 2016 - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois for the Treasury Board, Nicole Léger, calls on the Liberal government to step up negotiations aimed at finding a solution to the conflict between it and the lawyers of the State. “The Liberals are behaving like real cranks who want to ruin Christmas. They are turning a deaf ear to the demands of hundreds of lawyers and notaries from the Quebec state who have been on strike since October 24. There are therefore hundreds of mothers and fathers who will have to live in uncertainty, not knowing whether they will return to work after the holidays. The government should be ashamed, ”she denounced.
Not only must this conflict be resolved, for the good of all, but, in this file, liberal nonchalance has also serious impacts on the conduct of the affairs of the State. Indeed, combined with the crisis of legal delays, the strike by state lawyers creates the conditions for a perfect storm that could lead to the forced termination of hundreds of appeals now out of time. “Until the government resolves this protracted labor dispute, citizens will be deprived of the expertise essential to the proper functioning of public administration and law enforcement. The Liberals, by their laxity, are therefore adding fuel to the fire. And everyone loses it! The meager legislative record of the last parliamentary session of the Liberal government can attest to this, moreover… it fits on a Post-it! “, Illustrated the spokesperson.
In order to put all the chances on the side of a settlement of the conflict before the holidays, Nicole Léger made a very simple proposal to the government: negotiate. “There are only a few hours left before the start of the holiday break. Therefore, if it hopes to resolve this dispute quickly and get the lawyers back to work after Christmas, the government has only one option: to sit down at the table and negotiate in good faith. Is it so complicated, is it too much to ask? », She concluded.
