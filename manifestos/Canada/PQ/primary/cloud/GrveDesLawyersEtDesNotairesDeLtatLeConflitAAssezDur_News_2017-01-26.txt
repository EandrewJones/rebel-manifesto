Quebec, January 26, 2017– Nicole Léger, Parti Québécois spokesperson for the Treasury Board, deplores that the government position has hardly changed since the arrival of Pierre Moreau, thus forcing the strikers to persist.
“Since the start of the conflict, the Parti Québécois has demanded that negotiations be conducted in good faith, so that a negotiated solution can be found as soon as possible. However, state lawyers and notaries have just refused Pierre Moreau&#39;s offer. We expected him to do everything in his power to resolve the impasse, but that is not what happened, ”said Nicole Léger.
The Parti Québécois asks Pierre Moreau to make public the internal study of the Secretariat of the Treasury Board serving as the basis for the distinction it makes between the status of State lawyers and that of prosecutors associated with the Director of Criminal Prosecutions and criminal law (DPCP). “The main obstacle to resolving the conflict is whether state lawyers have the same special status as DPCP prosecutors. However, Pierre Moreau refuses to unveil the internal study which helps support the argument that state lawyers do not perform the same function as DPCP prosecutors. It is a lack of transparency incompatible with sound negotiations, ”added the spokesperson.
“The mandate given by the Prime Minister to Pierre Moreau is clear: to settle the longest conflict in the history of the Quebec public service. It must therefore activate! State lawyers, for 14 weeks, have found themselves in front of a government deaf to their demands. If this conflict has had and continues to have serious legal, financial, legislative and administrative impacts, it is because this government is showing contempt and closure, ”concluded the MP.
