Quebec - The Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for Northern Development, Ms. Martine Ouellet, is pleased to highlight the entry into force, on August 22, 2013, of the regulation requiring mining companies to deposit a financial guarantee of 100% of costs of restoring the mining sites they operate.
“The entry into force of this regulation is excellent news for all Quebecers. From now on, taxpayers will no longer have to foot the bill for the restoration of future derelict mine sites. This is an important step forward in ensuring responsible mining development, ”said Ms. Ouellet.
The new regulation increases the financial guarantee that mining companies must deposit from 70% to 100% of the estimated restoration costs. In addition, this guarantee now covers the entire mine site and not only the tailings accumulation areas, as was the case previously. The security deposit must be made over a period of two years following the start of a mine&#39;s operation, in three installments, whereas in the past, mining companies had up to 15 years to do so. Under Decree 838-2013, the regulation was published in the Gazette officielle du Québec on August 7. It comes into force 15 days later, today August 22, 2013.
“Already mining companies have acted responsibly by voluntarily providing their financial guarantee at the very start of operations. The draft regulation therefore aims to generalize and provide a framework for this good practice for better protection of the environment, ”concluded the Minister.
