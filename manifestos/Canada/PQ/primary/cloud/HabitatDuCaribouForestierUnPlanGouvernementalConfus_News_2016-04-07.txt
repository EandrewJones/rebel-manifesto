Quebec - The member for Bonaventure and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of forests, wildlife and parks, Sylvain Roy, deplores the confusion surrounding the implementation of an action plan for the development of the woodland caribou habitat. The plan, divided into two phases, first presents measures to protect woodland caribou, and then assesses their consequences on forest communities.
“The government works inconsistently. It should first assess the socioeconomic consequences of a protection plan on logging and supply to factories, then put in place measures in full knowledge of the facts. It is clear that by operating in reverse, the government is creating uncertainty in the forest communities of Saguenay – Lac-Saint-Jean and Nord-du-Québec, ”said Sylvain Roy.
The member for Bonaventure finds it completely unacceptable that the government improvised a strategy without taking forestry workers into account. According to him, it is abnormal that the government has still not published a study on the impact of caribou protection on jobs in the forest, although it has been in place since April 2014.
“The Prime Minister, who is also a Member of Parliament for the region affected by the action plan, promised during the last election campaign that no forestry job would be sacrificed for the protection of the caribou. However, two years after his election, his government presented a muddled plan that did not guarantee forestry workers that they would be able to keep their jobs. He must redo his homework and present us with a credible strategy! ”Sylvain Roy concluded.
