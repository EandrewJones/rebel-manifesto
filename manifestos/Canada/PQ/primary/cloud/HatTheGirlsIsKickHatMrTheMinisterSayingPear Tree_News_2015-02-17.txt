Quebec - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, denounces the cuts applied to the Chapeau, les filles! Competition, which underlines the will and the work of women who choose study in vocational or technical training programs leading to traditionally male occupations.
“Minister Yves Bolduc confirmed, during the question period, the end of the regional editions of the Chapeau, les filles! However, this is an important program for achieving real equality between men and women, precisely in areas where this equality is far from being achieved. Hats off, girls! costs $ 64,000; It is therefore a saving of candles in the government&#39;s budget, but which will have phenomenal impacts on the ground. Once again, it is women, especially those in the regions, who are subjected to liberal austerity, ”said Carole Poirier.
The MP also stresses that by imposing cuts to services and areas of activity particularly affecting women, the government is threatening the gains acquired at the cost of decades of struggles and mobilization. “When it is not the cuts to the Council on the Status of Women, or in the Equality to Decide program, it is the price increases of childcare centers, or even drastic cuts in health. Hats off, Minister! », Quipped Carole Poirier.
