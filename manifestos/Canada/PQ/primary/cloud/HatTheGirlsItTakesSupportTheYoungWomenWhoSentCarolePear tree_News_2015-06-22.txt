Quebec– The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, warmly congratulated the winners of the Chapeau, les filles! choose to study in vocational or technical training programs leading to traditionally male occupations. At the same time, she reminded the Liberal government that its cuts, which abolished the entire regional component of the competition, seriously endangered it.
“I would like to underline the will and the daring of these young women who choose to change our society by moving towards traditionally male professions. I heartily congratulate them and encourage them to continue to develop their passions and skills, ”said Carole Poirier.
In addition, the member deplored that the cuts imposed on Chapeau, les filles! by the Liberal government led to the end of the regional editions of the competition. “It is, however, an important program which has proved its worth in achieving real equality between men and women, precisely in areas where this equality is far from being achieved. Fortunately, many partners continued to support the competition; we are very grateful to them, ”she added.
“Hats off, girls! costs $ 64,000 per year; this sum represents an endless saving in the government&#39;s budget, but withdrawing it implies phenomenal impacts on the ground. Once again, it is women, especially those in the regions, who are subjected to liberal austerity. It is imperative that the Minister of Education, François Blais, restore full funding for the competition, ”concluded Carole Poirier.
