Quebec - The chief whip of the official opposition, Harold LeBel, accompanied by the member for Vachon and the Parti Québécois spokesperson for transport, maritime strategy and transport electrification, Martine Ouellet, tabled today &#39; hui a petition signed by more than 10,000 people who demand that &quot;the National Assembly of Quebec resolutely oppose the passage by train, on its territory, of petroleum products intended for export, in particular because of the high risks for them. ecosystems and public safety ”.
The two members of the Parti Québécois were accompanied by the citizen group No to an oil spill in the St-Laurent, at the origin of this petition, the Coalition of citizens and organizations committed to rail safety in Lac-Mégantic, the organization Oil Spot and the Quebec Network of Environmental Groups. Citizens are concerned about the Chaleur Terminals project, which involves transporting oil from the tar sands to New Brunswick by train for export. The rail convoy would cross the territory of Quebec.
“It&#39;s 240 tank cars, or almost 170,000 barrels, of oil from the tar sands that will be shipped to various world markets and that will pass through the heart of many cities in Quebec every day. The government stands idly by while the safety of citizens is at stake. Communities are concerned about the potential impacts of convoys of hazardous materials. I cannot remain silent in the face of such a project and I will support the population to the end in their approach to the authorities concerned, ”declared Harold LeBel.
“This petition is the demonstration that Quebeckers are mobilizing massively to say no to oil from the tar sands destined for export. We have repeatedly asked for a BAPE on the project, and several cities have passed resolutions to this effect, notably Rimouski and Montreal. By watching the train go by, the PLQ government is complicit in a dangerous project, synonymous with economic impoverishment, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
