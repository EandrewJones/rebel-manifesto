Official Opposition Social Services Critic Dave Turcotte and Seniors Critic Harold LeBel call on Health and Social Services Minister Gaétan Barrette to set up a fund emergency program intended for the management of health establishments, in order to enable them to fight more effectively against the heat.
IN SHORT
“Quebec is currently going through a historic heat wave; However, even if this heat had been announced, several people, in particular the elderly, suffer greatly from it. Given the fact that these heat episodes are bound to repeat themselves in the future, we ask the Liberal government to set up an emergency fund: all health establishments in Quebec, CHSLDs and hospitals, must be able to adequately air-condition their spaces, to ensure the comfort of both patients and workers. It&#39;s essential, ”said Dave Turcotte.
“We see it every day: the condition of CHSLDs and hospitals is deteriorating visibly. The establishments are dilapidated, unsuitable, sometimes even dangerous. And the austerity imposed on us by the Liberal government in recent years certainly did not help remedy the situation! After 15 years of Liberal rule, the Minister of Health must take stock and give us the true picture of the state of the network. In 2018, in Quebec, it is unacceptable that health establishments do not all have adequate air conditioning, ”insisted Harold LeBel, who recalls that the Parti Québécois asked, several weeks ago, for an investigation. of the Ombudsperson on the overall situation of CHSLDs.
Dave Turcotte is adamant that seniors and other patients in Quebec must never again experience such a situation. “A Parti Québécois government will put in place a plan, rolled out over one year, so that all health establishments can acquire an efficient air conditioning system. It is necessary, of course, but it is above all human, ”he concluded.
