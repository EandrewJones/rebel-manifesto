Québec, December 15, 2016 - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for education, research, school perseverance and literacy, Alexandre Cloutier, is delighted that the government has accepted the arguments of the Parti Québécois and the associations students, and that he finally agreed to increase student financial assistance with federal transfers.
The Minister of Higher Education, Hélène David, indeed announced this morning that she was giving up on diverting the $ 80 million provided for students following the enhancement of the federal government&#39;s scholarship program, funded by the abolition a tax credit. The resulting transfer to Quebec will ultimately go back to students&#39; pockets.
“In June 2016, the Parti Québécois put pressure on the Couillard government, alongside student associations, to have Minister David return this money to students. This victory will allow more than 11,000 students who are also single parents to receive more generous aid to continue their studies. Recall that of this number, 90% are women, ”said the spokesperson.
“It stands to reason that this is good news for students and families, but the government could not do otherwise. It should be remembered that these sums are not new; they come from the abolition of federal tax credits for studies and textbooks. The amounts thus released having been transferred to the Government of Quebec, Minister David had no choice but to remit this money directly to the students, ”added Alexandre Cloutier.
“Finally, if we can rejoice today, we must not forget that the revolving door installed in the office of liberal education ministers since 2014 has seriously hurt the network, which is struggling to breathe because of the avalanche of cuts it has been undergoing for several years. The Minister should listen more often to the proposals of the Parti Québécois and try to convince her Prime Minister that a real reinvestment in our schools is essential, ”concluded the deputy.
