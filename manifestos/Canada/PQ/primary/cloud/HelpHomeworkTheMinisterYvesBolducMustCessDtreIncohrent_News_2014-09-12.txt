Quebec - The member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition critic for elementary and secondary education and school perseverance, Nicole Léger, denounces the inconsistency of the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Yves Bolduc, when it comes to massive budget cuts in Quebec schools.
Today, the minister is saying, through his spokesperson, that the cuts to homework assistance in schools are totally unacceptable. However, in an article in the daily Le Soleil published on August 28, we learned that the minister&#39;s office had given school boards a list containing 32 suggestions for saving money. Among these, we found, in particular, a reduction in homework assistance.
“It was the minister who encouraged schools to cut homework assistance. And, now that some have followed his suggestion, he is outraged. He cannot wash his hands of it; he will have to understand that his budget cuts affect student services. Let him assume his lack of leadership. He&#39;s the one in charge, ”said Nicole Léger.
“By refusing to take responsibility for cuts to schools, Minister Yves Bolduc demonstrates once again that he is not up to his job. How long will Prime Minister Philippe Couillard tolerate this messy minister who improvises day by day? », Concluded the member of the Parti Québécois.
