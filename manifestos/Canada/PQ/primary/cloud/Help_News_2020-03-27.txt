Québec, March 27, 2020 - The member for René-Lévesque, parliamentary leader of the Parti Québécois and spokesperson for the economy, Martin Ouellet, asks the government to do more to support SMEs, especially those in the sectors services and goods. “It is these entrepreneurs who boost the economy of our regions; we have a duty to support them as much as possible, and as quickly as possible, ”he said.
IN SHORT
The member for René-Lévesque admits it from the outset: the government of François Legault has taken essential decisions to respond to the health crisis we are facing. However, the effort required of small traders comes at a particularly high price: in addition to having had to close their doors, they are hit hard by the inequity created by the inclusion of big-box stores in the list of shops. essential. For many specialist shops, the situation is perilous.
“We can&#39;t let that happen,” says Martin Ouellet. The survival of several small businesses depends on it. We must be sensitive to their situation. I spoke to the Minister of the Economy, Pierre Fitzgibbon, and asked him to provide cash to the affected business people as quickly as possible. I also called for the suspension of payments to Hydro Quebec, and the postponement of tax refunds collected in February and March. In my opinion, these first steps could tip the scales for many entrepreneurs. &quot;
“SMEs, especially those in the regions, participate in the creation of our collective wealth. When we have overcome this health crisis, we will need them to go up the slope, to revitalize our economy, to keep our environments attractive. That is why we are working tirelessly to prepare, as of now, for the coming recovery, ”Martin Ouellet also insisted.
Always ready to collaborate with the government, the members of the Parti Québécois caucus are deeply committed to finding the most effective and fastest means to support Quebec SMEs, and to help put them into practice.
