Québec– Alexandre Cloutier, Member of Parliament for Lac-Saint-Jean and official opposition spokesperson for education, research and school perseverance, and the Parti Québécois support the demands of the Quebec Student Union and of the Quebec Federation of College Students with regard to the $ 80 million in federal funds expected by Quebec.
“The Minister of Finance must first and foremost clarify what he intends to do with this money. He cannot leave the future of the students in doubt. For the Parti Québécois, it is obvious that federal funds must be transferred en bloc to the government of Quebec; otherwise, it would be a federal intrusion into our areas of jurisdiction. The government of Quebec must then return this money directly to the students, by improving the loans and bursaries program. This money must be used to guarantee accessibility to studies, ”said Alexandre Cloutier.
“If the government decided to do otherwise, students would be doubly penalized. In fact, federal tax credits for studies and textbooks, which were available to Quebec students, were abolished by Ottawa, which allowed the federal government to increase its bursary program by $ 300 million. The money saved in this way must be reinvested in student financial assistance, ”concluded the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
