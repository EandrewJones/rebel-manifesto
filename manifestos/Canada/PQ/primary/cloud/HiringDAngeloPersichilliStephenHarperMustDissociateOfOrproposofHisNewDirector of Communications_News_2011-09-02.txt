Quebec - Bernard Drainville, the member for Marie-Victorin and official opposition critic for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, invites Prime Minister Stephen Harper to dissociate himself from the remarks made a few months ago by his new director of communications, Angelo Persichilli, as he wrote a column in an Ontario daily.
“Mr. Harper is well aware of the consequences of such totally unacceptable comments. The Canadian Prime Minister has always condemned Quebec bashing from English Canada. I am convinced that he does not share the words of his communications director and I therefore ask him to send a clear message to the people of Quebec and to dissociate himself from Mr. Persichilli&#39;s comments, ”declared Bernard Drainville. .
The member for Marie-Victorin pointed out that Canadian bilingualism, a huge waste according to Mr. Persichilli, is practically not respected in the rest of Canada and that it is wrong to say that Quebec is proud to receive equalization. “In many cases, it is the federal government that is preventing Quebec from developing and enriching itself. The Old Harry case is a very good example, ”he added.
In addition, Bernard Drainville asks the government of Quebec, through its Minister of Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Pierre Moreau, to do like the Parti Québécois, and ask Stephen Harper to dissociate himself from it. “It is a matter of elementary respect and it is the responsibility of the Government of Quebec to react. Quebecers form a proud and unique nation, just like the Canadian nation. Often, we do not share the same point of view, but this should never prevent us from having mutual respect. Citizens have a right to expect that the example will come first from politicians, whether they are elected or not, ”concluded Bernard Drainville.
