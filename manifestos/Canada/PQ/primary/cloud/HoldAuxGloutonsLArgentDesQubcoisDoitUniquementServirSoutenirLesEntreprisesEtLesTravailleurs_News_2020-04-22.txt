Quebec, April 22, 2020 - The MNA for René-Lévesque and Parti Québécois finance spokesperson, Martin Ouellet, asks for guarantees: “The financial assistance paid by Quebec to businesses must be used to support as many SMEs as possible. and workers, and only that. In other words, we must absolutely prevent it from ending up in the pockets of senior leaders, ”he said.
IN SHORT
“It&#39;s a film in which Quebeckers have already played, and they hated it: seeing public money intended to save local businesses ultimately serve to enrich a handful of leaders at their head. As we are getting ready to rain the billions, we absolutely must prevent this scandalous scenario from repeating itself, ”insisted the member for René-Lévesque.
The Parti Québécois, through its spokesperson, therefore proposes that aid to businesses, in particular that of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), be granted only if the following two requirements are met:
It should be remembered that on March 30, when an envelope of $ 4 billion was announced to support Quebec businesses temporarily affected by the crisis, the Caisse decided, among other things, in view of the current economic context, to freeze salaries of all the leaders of the organization and its subsidiaries.
“More than ever, we need to stick together and act coherently. I also encourage as many business leaders as possible to voluntarily adhere to the same regime; it would be a nice gesture of solidarity, ”concluded Martin Ouellet.
