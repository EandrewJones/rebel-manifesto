Quebec - The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, was moved by the death of the writer, journalist and publisher Clément Marchand.
Recipient of numerous prizes, including twice the Athanase-David Prize, the highest distinction of the Government of Quebec in literature, Clément Marchand was also a conveyor of culture that leaves an indelible mark in Mauricie and throughout Quebec. As publisher, he has published several of Quebec&#39;s great poets and novelists and published the newspaper Le Bien public, providing a portrait of the political, economic and social life of the Mauricie.
&quot;There is an African proverb of universal significance which basically says: when an old man dies, it is a library that burns down&quot;, declared Minister Kotto. &quot;This metaphor applies in all respects to Clément Marchand who has dedicated his life to the vitality and influence of Quebec literature,&quot; added the Minister, offering his condolences to the relatives of the late deceased.
