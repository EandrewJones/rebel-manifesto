Quebec - The MP for Vachon and official opposition critic for mines and shale gas, Martine Ouellet, is concerned about the results of the study commissioned by the Auditor General of Quebec on the treatment of water in Quebec. the fracturing of shale gas. “The conclusions of Raymond van Coillie&#39;s analysis are very worrying for the health of the citizens of Quebec. Municipal wastewater treatment plants are simply not designed to treat wastewater from hydraulic fracturing, ”the spokesperson for the official opposition worried.
“This is another demonstration of the improvisation and amateurism of the Liberal government in its handling of the shale gas issue. Water from hydraulic fracturing contains metals and radioactive elements that can in particular reduce the treatment capacity of purification plants, thus endangering the quality of drinking water and the health of the population. It is extremely alarming, ”said Martine Ouellet.
“The researcher from the University of Sherbrooke is categorical. The attitude of the Liberal government towards the possibility for municipalities to treat water contaminated with hydraulic fracturing is absolutely inappropriate. As of now, this government has an obligation to take the necessary steps to ensure the sustainability of our water, ”added the Member for Vachon.
“The Parti Québécois demands an immediate moratorium on the exploration and exploitation of shale gas including any hydraulic fracturing activity in the territory. Raymond van Coillie&#39;s conclusions strengthen our position and the will of hundreds of Quebec citizens to block the road to the sorcerer&#39;s apprentices in the gas industry, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
