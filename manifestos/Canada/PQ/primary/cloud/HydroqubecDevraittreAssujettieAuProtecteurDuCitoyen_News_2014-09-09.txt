Quebec - The MNA for Marie-Victorin and official opposition spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, and the MNA for Rosemont and spokesperson for social services, Jean-François Lisée, agree with the request of the Ombudsperson, Raymonde Saint-Germain, that the state corporation Hydro-Québec be subject to the Québec Ombudsman Act.
Ms. Saint-Germain made this request this morning to the Committee on Institutions, while Jean-Francois Lisée was questioning her on this subject. Like the deputies, she wonders about the obligation for citizens to turn to the small claims court or even to a common law court when they believe that their rights are being infringed, while certain situations could be resolved a lot. more simply with the intervention of the Québec Ombudsman.
She also informed the deputies that she estimated at 1,500 the number of requests that the Protector would receive each year concerning Hydro-Québec, and that the cost generated by this legislative amendment &quot;would be amply offset by the savings that could be made, as much. to citizens than to Hydro-Québec, in terms of legal fees ”.
“It is desirable and necessary that citizens be able to have access to a body which will deal quickly with their requests, in an impartial manner. Hydro-Québec must be subject to verification by the Québec Ombudsman, who will carry out a rigorous analysis, as it does for all the other bodies with which it does business, ”declared Bernard Drainville.
Remember that in June 2013, under the Parti Québécois government, the National Assembly made Hydro-Québec subject to the jurisdiction of the Auditor General. &quot;It is just as logical that Hydro-Québec also work with the Québec Ombudsman so that the latter can intervene, support citizens who are experiencing prejudice and make recommendations to the Crown corporation,&quot; concluded Jean-Francois. Lisee.
