Québec, October 4, 2016 - The member for Sanguinet and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of economy, energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, calls on the Liberal government to subject Hydro-Québec to the mandate of the Protector of citizen.
“For two years now, the Ombudsperson, Raymonde Saint-Germain, asked the government for a mandate to deal with complaints from citizens who are dissatisfied with the responses obtained from Hydro-Québec customer service. Once again, last week, the Protector returned to the charge in her annual report: more than 400 people contacted her office in 2015-2016 to ask for her help in connection with Hydro Quebec. Ms. Saint-Germain, however, had to inform these citizens that, unfortunately, the crown corporation remains untouchable. This is unacceptable, ”said Alain Therrien.
“Remember that during the most recent study of budget appropriations, the Minister of Democratic Institutions said that she was studying the idea of subjecting Hydro Québec to the Québec Ombudsman. She even promised to involve all the deputies to determine the next steps. Where is his thinking? Was it blocked by the Prime Minister&#39;s Office? “, Also questioned the deputy of Sanguinet.
