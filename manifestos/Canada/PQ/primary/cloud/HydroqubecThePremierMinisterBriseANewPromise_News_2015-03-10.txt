Quebec - The member for Marie-Victorin and official opposition critic for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, denounces the fact that the Liberal government has again broken an election promise, while the tariffs of &#39;Hydro-Québec will increase by 2.9% on April 1.
“What Quebeckers are wondering is why rates are increasing, when Hydro-Quebec has had a record year in terms of profits. In addition, this new increase hits all families, especially those of the middle class. The Prime Minister had nevertheless promised to limit the increase in tariffs to indexation. This broken promise is added to a long list. How can we continue to trust the Prime Minister? The Liberal government must stop digging into the pockets of workers and families, ”said Bernard Drainville.
Remember that the Liberal Party promised, in 2012, to unfreeze the price of the heritage pool, which would have led to a 20% increase in Hydro-Québec rates; the Parti Québécois government canceled this unacceptable increase.
Tariffs for large houses “In addition, the signals sent by the government and its Minister of Energy, Pierre Arcand, are cause for concern; we are talking about the possibility of setting up a tariff for large houses. The minister, moreover, still has not explained to us what a big house is. Clearly, we want to use the pretext of energy efficiency to tax Quebec families even more, ”added Bernard Drainville.
Note that the increase announced by the Régie de l&#39;énergie results first and foremost from the liberal mismanagement of wind projects granted under Jean Charest, including one at a staggering price of 11.1 cents / kWh. &quot;In comparison, the last call for tenders launched by the Parti Québécois government ended at 6.3 cents / kWh, thus demonstrating the competitiveness of wind energy compared to new hydroelectric projects, including La Romaine&quot; , concluded the member for Marie-Victorin.
