Quebec - The member for Joliette and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, called on the Minister of Culture and Communications, Hélène David, to take action to save the René-Boileau house de Chambly, whose construction dates back to the beginning of the 19th century.
“Are our history and its marks in our daily life important in Quebec? With the René-Boileau house file, the Minister of Culture has a golden opportunity to answer this question and send a clear message. Recall that she indicated last week that the demolition of the ancestral home was suspended until April 29. It&#39;s the day after tomorrow. It is therefore one to midnight! ”, Insisted the member for Joliette.
Faced with the evasive responses of the minister, Véronique Hivon reaffirmed the historical and architectural interest of the René-Boileau house, and demanded that a notice of intention to classify it be issued. “The minister keeps listing everything that is already classified. Is she telling us it&#39;s too much? Is she telling us that there should be a quota? On the contrary, the René-Boileau house is part of a heritage ensemble and a tourist circuit. I ask the Minister to take her responsibilities and issue a notice of intention to classify the René-Boileau house, ”she continued.
Citizens and representatives of heritage defense organizations launched a cry from the heart for the preservation of this important piece of regional and national heritage, and recalled its importance in the landscape of their environment. “To hear the minister, it seems that preserving heritage is a problem. But that&#39;s not a problem, it&#39;s an opportunity. Our heritage is a collective wealth. We must all together make it a priority, ”concluded the member for Joliette.
