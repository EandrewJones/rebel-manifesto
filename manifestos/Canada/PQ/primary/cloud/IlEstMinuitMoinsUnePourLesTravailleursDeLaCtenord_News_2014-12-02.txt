Quebec– The MNA for René-Lévesque and Chief Whip of the Official Opposition, Marjolain Dufour, as well as the MNA for Bonaventure and spokesperson for forests, Sylvain Roy, ask the Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, Laurent Lessard, to take concrete measures to maintain jobs at the Resolute Forest Products plant in Baie-Comeau.
Yesterday, one of the three machines at the plant ceased operations. A second could do the same on December 12. “It is one to midnight for workers on the North Shore. The machines are closing and the minister has still not taken concrete action. People from the region took to the streets by the hundreds to denounce the situation. The Baie-Comeau plant is essential for maintaining forestry-related jobs on the North Shore. The entire forestry sector in the region is at stake, ”said Marjolain Dufour.
The forest estate has been hit hard in recent months; several factories have indeed interrupted their production in different regions, notably in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Saguenay – Lac-Saint-Jean, Estrie and Mauricie. Remember that the Liberal record is disastrous for the forestry sector: between 2003 and 2012, there were 20,000 direct job losses and 300 plant closures.
“The case of Baie-Comeau is not unique. The forest environment needs sustainable solutions. 82,000 full-time jobs have been lost since April, in all regions and all sectors, particularly the forestry sector. Why is the Minister of Forests waiting until factories are in danger of closing before taking action? “Asked Sylvain Roy.
