Quebec - The Minister responsible for Government Administration and President of the Conseil du trésor, Stéphane Bédard, wishes to rectify an erroneous information to the effect that the Conseil du trésor has revalued the salaries of CEGEP professors downwards.
&quot;Like the vast majority of public sector employees, CEGEP teachers have in their pocket a collective agreement valid until March 31, 2015. There is therefore no question of the government reducing their salaries,&quot; said Minister Bédard.
The parties held a first exchange last June about the value of college teaching jobs. Several other exchanges are expected in the coming months. So far, there has never been any question of the salary or salary structure of college teachers as part of this work, nor of any modification to the classification plan.
It should be remembered that an agreement aimed at carrying out work on salary relativities was concluded between the government and the major labor organizations during the last round of negotiations. Work has been underway on this subject since the fall of 2012. Their main objective is to evaluate jobs that were not covered by the work relating to pay equity, since they were not predominantly male or female. About thirty job categories will be the subject of such an evaluation, in particular that of college teachers.
