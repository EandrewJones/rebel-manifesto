Quebec City, May 17, 2017 - As part of the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, the Parti Québécois spokesperson for immigration and cultural communities, Carole Poirier, today presented a project of law to allow transsexual immigrants to change their name so that it reflects their real sexual identity, the Act to amend the Civil Code in order to allow any person domiciled in Quebec to obtain a change in the designation of sex appearing on his birth certificate.
IN SHORT
“Even though it is recognized as one of the most progressive places in the world in terms of LGBT rights, Quebec is the only jurisdiction in Canada to require Canadian citizenship to make a name change to reflect the gender identity. This can cause several problems for transgender people who have chosen to settle with us wishing to be able to fully enjoy their rights. The process to obtain Canadian citizenship can be extremely long; some cases show that it took seven years for a transgender immigrant to change their birth certificate; it is an aberration! », Declared Carole Poirier.
In the eyes of the spokesperson, action must be taken to remedy this situation. “When people flee from societies in which they were not accepted, it is our duty to make their lives easier, in any way possible. It&#39;s very much in the Quebec mentality and tradition, ”she continued.
“Let us remember that in the spring of 2015, the Committee on Institutions ruled that reflection on this issue was urgent and necessary. The Québec Ombudsman was already recommending going ahead with these legislative changes. For us, it is a very natural step forward that we must take as a society, ”concluded the MP.
