Quebec - The deputy for Bourget and official opposition spokesperson for immigration, Maka Kotto, considers the CAQ&#39;s proposal for the integration of newcomers unrealistic, improvised and inapplicable as long as Quebec remains in the Canada.
“The CAQ has accustomed us to draft bills without prior rigorous reflection. Once again, François Legault is surfing on a fundamental issue without taking the full measure of it. Many of the ideas put forward by the CAQ cannot currently be applied in Quebec, since we do not control our entire immigration policy, ”said Maka Kotto.
Assessment after three years
“Suppose that Quebec decides to deport a temporary resident who does not pass the test of the head of the CAQ; how would he do it, given that Canada issues the visa? With regard to immigration, Quebec is responsible for the selection of candidates, and Canada, for their admission. We do not even know the date of arrival of these people, because it is not Quebec that supervises the entry and exit of the territory at the borders; this is Canada, ”continued the MP.
&quot;If François Legault wishes to undertake negotiations with Ottawa so that Quebec obtains its full rights in matters of immigration, let it say so openly, instead of proposing unrealistic solutions,&quot; he added.
The CAQ weathervane
“Not long ago, the CAQ said that Quebec should welcome fewer immigrants; now she says otherwise. During the election campaign, less than a year ago, his program did not contain anything about this file; now he suggests solutions which are simply unworkable. The CAQ&#39;s proposal shows that it takes the challenges of immigration lightly. The only way to do what the CAQ is proposing is to achieve the sovereignty of Quebec; we would thus be the sole masters of our borders and our immigration policy, ”concluded Maka Kotto.
