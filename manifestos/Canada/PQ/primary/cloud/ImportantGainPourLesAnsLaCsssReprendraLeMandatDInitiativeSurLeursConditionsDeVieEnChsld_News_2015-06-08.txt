Quebec - During an arrest on May 22, the member for Richelieu and official opposition spokesperson for seniors, Sylvain Rochon, demanded that the Commission de la santé et des services sociaux (CSSS) resume its activities. work related to the living conditions of people accommodated in CHSLDs, as provided for in the mandate adopted in 2013 under the Parti Québécois government, but since abandoned. Our efforts have borne fruit: the Parti Québécois convinced the CSSS to take over the mandate, and the decision was announced earlier today.
“Each week brings us its share of disturbing stories involving seniors living in CHSLDs. This mandate of initiative responds to the concern that I have repeatedly expressed, that an issue like this must be able to be dealt with serenely and seriously, without interference or partisanship. The exchanges that I had with colleagues from other formations, when we debated the relevance of resuming the mandate of initiative, allow me to hope for eminently constructive work, carried out in the interest of seniors in Quebec. », Declared Sylvain Rochon.
The CSSS will therefore be called upon to continue the mandate of initiative entitled Living conditions of adults accommodated in residential and long-term care centers. The public hearings being over, the members of the CSSS will visit a certain number of CHSLDs and will then look into the production of a report in which they will make recommendations to the government.
“The deputies of the National Assembly were able to agree on the conditions to be met to carry out the Special Commission on the question of dying with dignity; I am confident that we can develop a broad consensus on those allowing adults accommodated in CHSLDs to live in dignity, ”concluded the spokesperson.
