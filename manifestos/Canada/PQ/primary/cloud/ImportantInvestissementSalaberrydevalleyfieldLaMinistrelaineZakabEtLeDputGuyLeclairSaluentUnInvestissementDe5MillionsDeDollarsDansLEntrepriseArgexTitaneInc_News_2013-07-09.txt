The investment, made through Ressources Québec, a subsidiary of Investissement Québec, consists of a total participation of $ 5 million in the share capital of Argex Titane (TSX-V: RGX). It will enable the company to realize its project relating to the establishment of a new research and development center and to set up its first titanium dioxide production plant in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, in Quebec.
“The Government of Quebec is proud to support this strategic investment project, which will generate significant economic benefits for the Montérégie region. Quebec&#39;s prosperity depends on projects that combine innovation and economic development, such as that of Argex Titane, ”said Minister Delegate Élaine Zakaïb. “Argex Titane will not only be able to carry out its research and development activities in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, but also to pursue its growth there. &quot;
Argex Titanium specializes in the production of high purity titanium dioxide, an inorganic pigment extracted from titanium minerals. The main objective of the company is to quickly start production in order to deploy its exclusive process allowing it to produce high purity TiO2 directly from raw materials.
“This development project will contribute to the economic growth of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, in addition to promoting the many assets of Beauharnois and Suroît in order to encourage other processing companies to come and settle there. This investment will also ultimately lead to the creation of several quality jobs in the region, which is excellent news, ”said MP Guy Leclair.
