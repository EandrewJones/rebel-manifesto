Quebec - The federal regulations contain a loophole allowing the importation into Quebec of dairy proteins. André Villeneuve, Parti Québécois spokesperson for agriculture and food, is worried about the effects of this breach on the price of milk on the farm. Yesterday, he tabled a motion in the National Assembly asking the federal government to stop it permanently.
“The source of the problem is known. Federal rules allow the importation of milk protein. It is a glaring flaw in the regulations. Some producers lose up to $ 25,000 per year, which represents, for all of Quebec, a shortfall of around $ 200 million. The situation continues to deteriorate and Ottawa refuses to close the gap, ”said the member for Berthier.
After André Villeneuve questioned Minister Pierre Paradis during question period yesterday, the government agreed to support the Parti Québécois motion. “It is essential that the National Assembly send a unanimous message to the federal government: it must plug the breach. Now the ball is in the Trudeau government&#39;s court. Minister Paradis is however responsible for ensuring that Ottawa resolves the problem affecting our dairy producers, ”continued the Member for Berthier.
The motion, carried unanimously, reads as follows:
&quot;That the National Assembly ask the federal government to strictly apply the standards governing the importation of milk proteins in order to avoid the weakening of supply management and the considerable reduction in the price of milk on the farm, this which causes significant financial losses for Quebec producers and weakens their businesses;
That she ask the federal government to close the loophole that allows the importation of dairy proteins from the United States. &quot;
