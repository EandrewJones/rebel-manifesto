Quebec - The parliamentary leader of the official opposition, Bernard Drainville, invites the other political parties to advance the work of the committee on theReport on the implementation of the Code of ethics and professional conduct of members of the National Assembly.
The Parti Québécois wants the improvement of the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct for Members of Parliament to progress. “We already proposed, at the end of the work, last June, to work quickly on the articles which did not pose a major problem. We are open and ready to collaborate, ”said Bernard Drainville.
In order to get back to work, the official opposition will submit today to the Committee on Institutions a list of people to be heard in order to help parliamentarians in their work. “These are the same stakeholders who were heard when the Code was created. If their recommendations were relevant when we created the Code of Ethics, they certainly still are, now that we are modernizing it. We hope that the other parties will agree to our request, ”continued Mr. Drainville.
&quot;If the Liberal Party and the CAQ want a real improvement of the Code, and if we end up, in the near future, with a constructive bill, they will have the full cooperation of the Parti Québécois&quot;, he concluded.
