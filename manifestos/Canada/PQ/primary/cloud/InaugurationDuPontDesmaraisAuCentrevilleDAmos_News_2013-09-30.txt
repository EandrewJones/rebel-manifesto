Amos– The Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Minister responsible for the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, Mr. François Gendron, proceeded today on behalf of the Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, and in the company of the Mayor of Amos, Mr. Ulrick Chérubin, at the official inauguration of the new Desmarais Bridge that spans the Harricana River in downtown Amos.
Begun in April 2012, the construction of the new Desmarais bridge required investments of $ 15.9 million.
“It replaces the old concrete bridge, built in 1939, which itself replaced a covered bridge which had been in operation since 1919. This shows the importance of this road link for the population of Amos in the dawn of the city&#39;s 100th anniversary, which we will all be celebrating together in 2014, ”noted Minister Gendron.
The new Desmarais Bridge has three traffic lanes, two of which are eastbound, two unidirectional cycle lanes and sidewalks on either side of the bridge. In addition, the new structure no longer exhibits the curvature of the old one, which represents a gain in terms of safety.
Although the new Desmarais Bridge is open to traffic, the work is not yet finished. Among other things, it remains to dismantle the temporary one-lane bridge that allowed west to east traffic during the work. The dismantling of this bridge should be completed next November.
Minister Gendron wishes to thank everyone who worked on this project. “This new infrastructure is adapted to the needs of all users. Driver, pedestrian and cyclist will find their account there. This is one of the most important assets for the city of Amos, an asset from which it will benefit during the second century of its history ”.
