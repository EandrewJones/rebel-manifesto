La Prairie - The Minister for Industrial Policy and the Quebec Economic Development Bank, Ms. Élaine Zakaïb, confirms the allocation of financial assistance of $ 229,500 to the company IRT Technologies of La Prairie for the design and the manufacture of a high-capacity frequency converter intended for the satellite telecommunications market, an innovative project valued at more than $ 753,000.
&quot;The growth of the Quebec telecommunications industry is based on the dynamism of businesses and the avant-garde nature of their research and development projects,&quot; said Ms. Zakaïb. “IRT Technologies specializes in a key sector of our economy which represents approximately 43% of revenues and 55% of jobs in Quebec&#39;s information technology and telecommunications industry. Today&#39;s announcement clearly reflects our government&#39;s commitment to innovation and businesses that stand out for their creativity and daring, beyond just starting up. &quot;
Founded in 2011, the company IRT Technologies designs and manufactures satellite telecommunications devices. It is still in the start-up stage and is currently working on the development of its first product line.
“Our frequency converter will act as a relay between satellite operators and residential and commercial customers,” said Mr. Arkadi Potapov, president of IRT Technologies. “The financial assistance granted by the Government of Quebec will allow us to develop and test our new technology, which, we hope, will quickly open the doors to the North American market. &quot;
