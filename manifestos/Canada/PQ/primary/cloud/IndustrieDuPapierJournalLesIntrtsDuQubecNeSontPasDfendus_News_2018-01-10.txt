Quebec, January 10, 2018 - Sylvain Roy, MP for Bonaventure and official opposition spokesperson for forests, wildlife and parks, and Nicolas Marceau, urge the Couillard government to defend Quebec&#39;s interests more vigorously in Ottawa and to reassure the 7,000 workers in the newsprint industry, who are hit by a new tax on their exports to the United States.
IN SHORT
“The failure of the Couillard-Trudeau duo against the American administration is obvious. So far, they have failed to enforce the commercial rights of Quebecers. Quebec&#39;s voice is not being heard at the negotiating table, and Justin Trudeau does not seem poised to make it a priority. However, the majority of newsprint mills are located in Quebec; our regions will therefore be the first to be affected. In our region, 250 municipalities make a living from the forest industry, and 100 depend entirely on it, ”insisted Nicolas Marceau.
Sylvain Roy, for his part, appeals to the sense of responsibility of the Quebec Minister of Forests, Luc Blanchette. “Failing to have defended the interests of Quebec, the Minister must immediately ensure that a support program is put in place that meets the real needs of businesses. And, this time around, we must avoid repeating the mistakes made when setting up the program to counter the effects of the surtax on Canadian lumber exports. Remember that this program was announced in April 2017, but that no one has had access to it yet. Obviously, it does not meet the needs of the forest industry, ”said Sylvain Roy.
