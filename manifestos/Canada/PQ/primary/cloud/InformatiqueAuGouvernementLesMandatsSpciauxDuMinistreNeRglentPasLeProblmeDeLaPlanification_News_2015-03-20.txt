Quebec - The member for Bonaventure and official opposition spokesperson for information resources, Sylvain Roy, deplores that the measures announced by the president of the Treasury Board, Martin Coiteux, to fight against illegal practices in the granting computer contracts, in no way resolve the lack of planning by the Government of Quebec with regard to management in this area.
&quot;The mandates entrusted to the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit (UPAC) and to the Auditor General (VG) provide no solution to the problem repeatedly criticized by the VG in his recent reports, namely the lack of an overall vision and clear guidelines in the management of IT contracts in government, ”said Sylvain Roy.
The MP for Bonaventure believes that the UPAC arrests last week provide an opportunity for the government to address immediate issues related to information resources, such as the loss of internal expertise and the lack of competition between the bidding companies.
“We believe that the solution involves, among other things, the hiring of great specialists with an irreproachable sense of ethics and respect for the State to fill strategic positions, so that important IT projects are coordinated with rigor. Unfortunately, the announcements made by the Liberal government offer nothing to resolve the problems related to information resources, which cost Quebec taxpayers a fortune each year. However, when the Parti Québécois was in power, we began a major work of revising contractual practices in IT. Where is this site? Asked the member for Bonaventure.
“One-off and short-term solutions must be accompanied by comprehensive and long-term planning for IT contract management in government. It is for this reason that we are asking Minister Coiteux to quickly launch an investigation into this matter in order to shed light on the entire problem, ”concluded Sylvain Roy.
