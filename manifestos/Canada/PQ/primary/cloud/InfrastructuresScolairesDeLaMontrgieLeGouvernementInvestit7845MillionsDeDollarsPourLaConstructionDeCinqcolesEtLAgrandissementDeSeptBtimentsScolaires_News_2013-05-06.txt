Brossard - The Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports and Minister responsible for the Montérégie region, Ms. Marie Malavoy, is pleased to announce the construction of five schools and the expansion of seven school buildings for an investment of $ 78.45 million in Montérégie.
&quot;It is with great pleasure that I am announcing, for the Montérégie region, the construction of five schools, for a government investment of $ 46.86 million, and the expansion of seven school buildings, for $ 31.59 millions of dollars. These investments clearly show that education is our government&#39;s priority. The projects announced will have the effect of adding 153 classrooms, rooms for daycare services and gymnasiums as well as adjoining service rooms, which will accommodate students from 8 school boards. This is what communicates the taste and the pleasure of learning! ”Ms. Malavoy said.
The announcement was made at Charles-Bruneau School in Brossard, whose facilities are already in full use. Thanks to these investments, the City of Brossard and the Marie-Victorin School Board will soon be able to count on a new school to serve families.
“This year,” continued the Minister, “we are going to build 23 schools in Quebec and finance 46 extensions for a total sum of 460 million dollars, almost double the number of last year! &quot;
In total, over the next ten years, nearly $ 8.1 billion in investments will be used to improve Quebec&#39;s school infrastructure. Whether it is about adding space, as for the projects announced today, maintaining assets or other initiatives, this investment demonstrates the government&#39;s desire to offer quality educational services to students, in environments conducive to learning and development, while ensuring sound management of public funds.
“I am delighted for the citizens of the communities targeted by these projects. These infrastructure investments will have direct repercussions on services to the population as well as on the well-being and quality of life of families in several neighborhoods. By meeting important needs for premises and space for students and school staff, our government contributes to social progress and the vitality of the economy. In my view, this is a real vision for the future for Quebec, ”concluded the Minister.
With the Quebec Infrastructure Plan, the government is making sure to renew and improve infrastructure in all sectors, including educational institutions, the road network, public transit, health and social services institutions, municipal infrastructures, cultural facilities, social housing as well as public security establishments.
As soon as it came to power, the Parti Québécois government set about cleaning up investment projects. The ten-year horizon of the 2013-2023 Quebec Infrastructure Plan will make it possible to assess needs prospectively, based on the priorities of Quebecers, to properly measure the associated costs and thus to make the right choices for Quebec. This new way of planning and managing infrastructure is based on honesty, integrity and thoroughness.
