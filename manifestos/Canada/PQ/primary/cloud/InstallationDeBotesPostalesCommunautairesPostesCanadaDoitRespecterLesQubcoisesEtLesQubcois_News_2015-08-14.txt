Quebec - Stéphane Bergeron, the member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, denounces the inadmissible attitude of Canada Post in the matter of installing community mailboxes on municipal territory from Quebec.
“Once again, we have a heartbreaking example of a Crown corporation shamelessly abusing its powers under Canadian law. Canada Post installs concrete slabs, even in parks, without consulting anyone. This approach shows all the arrogance of the federal government towards Quebeckers. The leaders of federal political parties must immediately commit to ordering Canada Post to work in collaboration with the populations and municipalities concerned, rather than imposing its will on them, ”declared Stéphane Bergeron.
“What is most heartbreaking is that the case of Canada Post is far from being an isolated case. In several other cases, Quebeckers are not fully in control of their territory. For example, Quebec will have no decision-making power in the matter of the expansion of the Port of Quebec. We should also mention the intransigence of the National Energy Board, particularly with regard to the energy east pipeline. Even companies under federal jurisdiction, such as CN, can ignore Quebec&#39;s requirements related to their operations with impunity, ”added the member for Verchères.
Meanwhile, the Premier of Quebec does not even deign to impose himself on the federal government in order to ensure that Quebec&#39;s prerogatives are respected. “Where is Philippe Couillard, when federal agencies are going beyond their jurisdictions? Does its radical federalism prevent it from intervening in favor of the citizens of Quebec? », Concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
