Quebec - “On February 15, we announced measures that are close to our hearts, in the Parti Québécois, in order to restore the confidence of citizens and calm the political crisis caused by too many years in power of the Liberal Party of Jean Charest. In light of the Léger Marketing survey published yesterday in the Journal de Québec and the Journal de Montréal, we saw fit to remind citizens of these proposals and to ask the government to show a certain openness towards them, in vain ”, said from the outset the member for Chicoutimi and official opposition spokesperson for the reform of democratic institutions, Stéphane Bédard.
“The scandals in which the Liberals have been bathing for several years are cause for concern among the population. After three terms, Jean Charest will have accomplished one thing: he will have brought cynicism towards the political class to its climax. When ministers subcontract their funding cocktails to engineering firms, it is high time for things to change, ”added Stéphane Bédard.
A Parti Québécois government will limit the influence of money within political parties. We have made a commitment that the maximum political contribution will be $ 100 and that the political contribution tax credit will be eliminated. “We are even now thinking about setting up completely public funding at zero cost for the population. The Liberal scandals are leading us in this direction and their refusal to discuss our proposals is something to worry us even more, ”continued the deputy.
&quot;We have also been proposing for more than two years to limit the mandate of the Prime Minister and that of elected municipal officials, a proposal that the Liberals also refuse, stubbornly, without our understanding what this hides,&quot; concluded Stéphane Bédard.
