Quebec - The Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Ms. Marie Malavoy, warmly congratulates Quebecer Eugenie Bouchard, who, thanks to her journey of five wins to the semifinals at the Australian Tennis Open, could reach the top 20 of the women&#39;s world ranking.
“What a spectacular breakthrough from this talented and charismatic young tennis player! It is with excitement that we have followed his recent journey, which should allow him to move, in just over a year, from 144th position to the top 20 in the world rankings. All hopes are high for Eugenie Bouchard, who can now aim for the highest heights, ”said Ms. Malavoy.
Eugenie Bouchard lost in the semi-final to China&#39;s Li Na. At 19, she became the first Quebecer to reach the final four of one of the four Grand Slam tournaments. Note that the athlete achieved this feat, when she was only in her second full season on the women&#39;s circuit.
“His performance and his inspiring attitude caused enormous enthusiasm, which is very promising for Quebec tennis. She is already an example for several young athletes. There is no doubt that she will henceforth be an extraordinary ambassador for this sport. Quebec needs models who give the taste and the pleasure to move and lead a physically active life, ”concluded the Minister.
