Quebec, December 19, 2016 - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of digital politics and economy and electronic commerce, as well as in matters of culture and communications, Martine Ouellet, considers that the announcement of the program &quot; Québec branché ”, made today by the Minister responsible for the Digital Strategy, Dominique Anglade, is far from meeting expectations.
“Nearly 300,000 Quebec households would not have access to high speed Internet at this very moment. We are soon in 2017; access to this service is now essential, as much for the development of the regions of Quebec as for SMEs, families, training or teleworking. In 2011, the Liberal government estimated needs in this area at nearly $ 1 billion over 10 years; the investment of 100 million announced today is obviously not enough, ”denounced Martine Ouellet.
The spokesperson also recalls the Liberal government&#39;s disastrous record for the regions. “After the destruction of their economic development tools, and despite the issues of lumber, intercity transport, local forests and bank erosion, which are lying dormant on a shelf, here is a Montreal minister announcing a meager 100 million for the deployment of high-speed Internet service in rural areas. What are its objectives? How many households does she plan to connect with this sum? In some RCMs in Quebec, the cost of connection is $ 30 million; the sums available will therefore be largely insufficient. However, the Liberal government must ensure that all regions, that all citizens, have access to high speed Internet, ”she concluded.
