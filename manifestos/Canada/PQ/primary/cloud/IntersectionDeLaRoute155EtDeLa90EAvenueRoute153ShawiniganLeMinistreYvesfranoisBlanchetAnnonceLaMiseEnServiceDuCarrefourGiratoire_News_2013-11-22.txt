Trois-Rivières– Yves-François Blanchet, Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks and Minister responsible for the Mauricie and Center-du-Québec regions, on behalf of the Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announces the commissioning of the roundabout located at the intersection of route 155 and 90e Avenue (route 153) in Shawinigan, Saint-Georges-de-Champlain sector, since yesterday morning.
The intersection of Route 155 and 90th Avenue, used daily by a large number of vehicles, is ideal for such a development. There are 9,700 vehicles per day on Route 155 while 9,600 vehicles use 90th Avenue daily.
“I am delighted with the implementation of this new infrastructure. The formula has in fact already proved its worth in several places around the world, particularly in Quebec, the new roundabout will help reduce the number and severity of accidents, while promoting the flow of traffic in this sector ”indicated the Minister Yves-François Blanchet.
Remember that a roundabout is a development comprising one or more traffic lanes surrounding a central island. Traffic in these lanes is anti-clockwise. In addition, users who want to enter an intersection must give way to vehicles already circulating there.
Information on intersections is also available on the Transports Québec website: (http://www.mtq.gouv.qc.ca/portal/page/portal/entreprises/camionnage/reseau_routier/carrefours_giratoires)
