Quebec - &quot;I am absolutely outraged that the Liberals refused to give their consent to the presentation of a motion denouncing the campaign of intimidation of which author and columnist Djemila Benhabib is the victim,&quot; declared the MP for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for secularism, Carole Poirier.
“Ms. Benhabib received so many hate emails because she had the courage to denounce certain problematic situations arising from religious extremism. Benoît Dutrizac and Richard Martineau denounced these unacceptable threats. We in the Parti Québécois have always defended freedom of opinion and freedom of the press. The Liberals must explain themselves! How can they use the argument of the time the motion was sent, when, like us, they learned about the problem in the papers this morning? Their attitude is unacceptable. What are they afraid of? », Asked Carole Poirier.
The motion presented read as follows: “That the National Assembly denounce the intimidation campaign against Djemila Benhabib following his criticisms of religious fundamentalism and that the Assembly reaffirm respect for the right to freedom of &#39;opinion. &quot;
“I cannot imagine that in-depth discussions should be held within the Liberal caucus to determine whether or not to denounce comments such as those that can be read in the comments on Ms. Benhabib&#39;s blog. It seems to me that it is clear, it is unacceptable! », Carole Poirier concluded.
