Quebec, April 21, 2017 - The Parti Québécois agriculture spokesperson, André Villeneuve, calls on the Liberal government, as well as the company Pangea and its partners, to respond in full transparency to the many concerns of farmers, raised in the wake of today&#39;s announcement of an investment. In addition, clear guidelines must be put in place to ensure that farmers will retain ownership of agricultural land.
IN SHORT
“The legitimate concerns of farmers must be heard by the government. For three years, uncertainty has persisted as to this model, which is constantly expanding, while the guidelines have not all been defined and many questions remain unanswered. The government should not sign a blank check; it must demand transparency in return for the public funds that will be invested. It must, moreover, adopt legislative measures that will guarantee that the Pangea model does not lead to the financialization of our agricultural lands or to speculation, which penalizes the next generation rather than offering them real solutions. To make sure of this, we are asking the Liberal government to come out of its inaction and call for Bill 599 aimed at countering the grabbing of farmland presented by the Parti Québécois, ”demanded the member for Berthier.
“The main concern of the Parti Québécois is to obtain a guarantee that farmer-operators will remain the owners of Quebec farmland. We have always been alongside farmers. Their concerns are very understandable, and the government has an obligation to respond to them, ”concluded André Villeneuve.
