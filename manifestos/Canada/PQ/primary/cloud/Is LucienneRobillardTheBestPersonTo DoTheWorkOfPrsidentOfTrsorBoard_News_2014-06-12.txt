Quebec - Elaine Zakaïb, the member for Richelieu and official opposition spokesperson for the Conseil du trésor, judges that Lucienne Robillard is not the right person to head the Permanent Program Review Commission set up by the President from the Treasury Board, Martin Coiteux.
“Lucienne Robillard was part of the Council of Ministers of a Liberal government during the worst years of management in the history of Quebec. A government which, at the beginning of the 1990s, had first allowed program spending to increase by 8%, then by 10%, and then left power with a deficit of 6 billion, ”argued Élaine Zakaïb.
Lucienne Robillard was then a member of the Council of Ministers of Jean Chrétien, the government responsible for the sponsorship scandal. She also said that the fiscal imbalance is a myth and that Option Canada&#39;s illegal spending of half a million dollars was anecdotal spending.
“The President of the Conseil du trésor must justify the decision to appoint Lucienne Robillard as head of the Commission, which he refused to do today. As this commission will be responsible for identifying the cuts that will hurt Quebeckers, the least thing would be to know why the Liberals chose Lucienne Robillard to lead it, ”indicated the Member for Richelieu.
