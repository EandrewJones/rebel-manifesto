Quebec - “Jacques Duchesneau&#39;s departure from the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit (UPAC) must be interpreted for what it is: a dismissal. Obviously, Mr. Duchesneau has just been fired for having talked too much and upset the Liberal government ”.
This is what the member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for public security said, reacting to the decision unveiled today and taken by the head of the UPAC, Robert Lafrenière, to show the door to M. Duchesneau.
“Already that UPAC has struggled to recruit staff since it was set up eight months ago, it is at the very least astonishing that it has afforded the luxury of firing the head of the anti-collusion unit of the Ministry of Quebec Transport. It&#39;s a funny message, because nothing is settled, far from it, continued the member for Verchères. It does not bode well for the future. It is also a signal that the Duchesneau report, disemboweled in the media, upset many of the liberal troops, ”he added.
The Parti Québécois believes that the UPAC&#39;s job is not to play the government&#39;s game, but to investigate criminal offenses and make arrests and indictments.
“Announced with great fanfare more than eight months ago, the UPAC has yet to deliver the expected results, like the Marteau squad, set up two years ago. It is rather disappointing and it is not by firing investigators that we will succeed in arresting those responsible for collusion and corruption in Quebec, ”concluded Stéphane Bergeron, who also wondered about the price. that taxpayers will have to assume to terminate Jacques Duchesneau&#39;s contract before expiry.
