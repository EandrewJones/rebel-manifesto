Quebec - While thousands of parents form human chains around Quebec schools in order to demonstrate their attachment to the public network, hard hit by the liberal cuts, the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and Parti Québécois spokesperson on the matter of primary and secondary education and school perseverance, Nicole Léger, calls on the Minister of Education, François Blais, to stop the cuts affecting student services and make the success of young people his only priority.
“What really concerns parents is the quality of education offered to children in Quebec, not the technocratic reforms that the minister is cooking up. What we need, in Quebec, is not a bureaucratic minister who plays in the structures, but a leader who goes into the field and who really cares about the success of the students ”, declared Nicole. Lightweight.
Since its election in April 2014, the Liberal Party has cut the purchase of books, services for children with learning disabilities, homework help, etc. It should also be remembered that it wishes to increase the number of students per class and reduce the resources dedicated to young people with disabilities. “The government is slashing education, dramatically increases the bill for child care services and, after that, the minister is surprised that parents are organizing protests. Obviously, he is totally out of touch with reality, ”added the spokesperson.
“Since his appointment, we have the impression that François Blais is more the executor of the liberal cuts decreed by the Treasury Board than a true Minister of Education with the interests of young people at heart,” concluded Nicole Léger.
