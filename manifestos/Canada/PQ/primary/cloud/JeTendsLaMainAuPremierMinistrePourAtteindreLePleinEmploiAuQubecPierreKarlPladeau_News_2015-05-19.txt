Quebec - The Leader of the Official Opposition and Member of Parliament for Saint-Jérôme, Pierre Karl Péladeau, has called on the Prime Minister to take action to ensure that a real economic policy emerges in Quebec. He offered him his collaboration in order to invite all the players to an economic forum.
“Quebec has major challenges to meet. Our demographics are a good example. We must be even more efficient to move Quebec forward. The development of the North and the maritime strategy will not be enough. I offer my collaboration to the Prime Minister and suggest that he invite the socio-economic players to an important meeting, where we can, together, help define the means and priorities of a real sustainable growth plan ”, declared Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“The news of recent weeks shows that the protection of our finest companies is more relevant than ever. Think of Alcan, Bombardier, Cirque du Soleil, SNC-Lavalin… This morning, Tembec announced the closure of 3 factories and the loss of 350 jobs. It takes leadership in Quebec. The Prime Minister must recognize the urgent need to act to better protect our flagships and our head offices, ”he added.
“The thousands of fathers and mothers who have just lost their jobs at Bombardier, at the Davie shipyard, at Alcan&#39;s head office or this morning at Tembec are not statistics. The loss of a job is a difficult ordeal for affected families. The Prime Minister cannot trivialize this situation. I therefore reiterate my invitation to the Prime Minister, hoping that he will take the initiative of bringing together all the players in order to endow Quebec with a real policy of full employment, ”concluded the leader of the official opposition.
