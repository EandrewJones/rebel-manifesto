Quebec - Faced with an imminent election call, the Leader of the Official Opposition and Member of Parliament for Charlevoix, Pauline Marois, asks the Premier to commit now to no longer using public funds for partisan purposes.
The announcement of a $ 58 million loan to the Jeffrey mine last Friday smacks of electoralism. Not only is this money going to a Liberal contributor, but it will be used to fund a dying industry with no future for the sole purpose of trying to win over the constituency of the constituency of Richmond.
&quot;The Prime Minister should be respectful of public funds and immediately commit to no longer using Quebecers&#39; money to make electoral announcements,&quot; declared the leader of the official opposition, demanding to know the exact nature of the campaign. loan granted to Jeffrey mine.
The people of Richmond are not fooled. Already, mine workers have been disappointed to learn that they will not be able to return to work for a year. However, Jean Charest taught us not to trust this type of electoral announcements.
In 2007, on the first day of the election campaign, Jean Charest pledged $ 200 million for the relaunch of the Wayagamack Kruger plant in Trois-Rivières and the creation of 200 jobs. This project has not yet been completed.
A few days later in 2007, the Prime Minister promised $ 400 million for the expansion of the Hôtel-Dieu in Quebec. Not only have the costs doubled in the last five years, but the project has not yet been completed.
In 2008, shortly before the start of the electoral campaign, Jean Charest announced a $ 1.2 billion project in Bécancour for a solar panel factory project for the company REC Silicon. The project which was to create 300 jobs has not yet seen the light of day.
&quot;As the electoral campaign approaches, when we see the electoral announcements multiplying, the Prime Minister must give up trying to buy his election with public funds,&quot; concluded Pauline Marois.
