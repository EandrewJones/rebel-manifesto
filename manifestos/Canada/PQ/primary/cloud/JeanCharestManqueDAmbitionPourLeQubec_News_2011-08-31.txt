Saguenay - The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and opposition critic for international relations, Alexandre Cloutier, once again notes that Premier Jean Charest lacks ambition for Quebec and is taking advantage of his mission by China to underestimate the interest of foreign countries in Quebec.
“Jean Charest said today that Quebec would be less able to do well if it were a“ small ”sovereign country. I remind Mr. Charest that, according to OECD indicators, 9 of the 15 richest countries have a population equal to or less than Quebec. It is sad that the Prime Minister does not have enough confidence in the people of Quebec and that he believes that Quebec must fall back on the Canadian federation to be “interesting” in the eyes of the world, ”declared Alexandre Cloutier.
However, we will remember that in 2006 the Prime Minister said during a trip to France that Quebec has the “means” to be a sovereign country.
“It is surprising to hear the Prime Minister rejoice in the meetings he has obtained in China, while being the premier of a simple &#39;province&#39;. It is not surprising that Jean Charest is welcomed with open arms by investors to whom he intends to sell off the natural resources of northern Quebec. For the Parti Québécois, it is clear that Quebec not only has the means, but also the interest of becoming a sovereign country to make its voice heard and prosper in the world, ”concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
