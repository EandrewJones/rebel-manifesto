Quebec City, October 5, 2017 - The Leader of the Official Opposition, Jean-François Lisée, and Culture and Communications Critic, Agnès Maltais, denounce the historic renunciation of Liberal Prime Minister Philippe Couillard against of the full project management of Quebec in the field of culture.
IN SHORT
“The Prime Minister is abandoning a demand that was made by Robert Bourassa, Jean Charest, Liza Frulla and Christine St-Pierre, all of whom agree that Quebec must hold all the resources and all the power to act on culturally. Philippe Couillard, he prefers to leave all this in the hands of the federal government and Mélanie Joly. What is more, the argument he invokes, namely federal funding in relation to the Quebec population, was also true at the time of Robert Bourassa or Jean Charest, without them abandoning their demands ” , first recalled Jean ‑ François Lisée.
“In the spring, in his &#39;policy of affirmation of Quebec&#39;, Philippe Couillard took up several historic demands from Quebec. But not a word on the cultural level. Nothing, either, in the project to renew Quebec&#39;s cultural policy. Why abandon the struggles led by Mr. Bourassa and Mr. Charest? Why keep silent before the federal government? », Continued Jean-François Lisée.
“Recently, Canada published, for the first time, a cultural policy. Quebec did not have a say, as did the agreement that Ottawa concluded with Netflix. However, it is here that we know how to support our culture, our films, our artists, our music, our literature. We must have full powers in the area of culture, so that our artisans are adequately supported, ”concluded Agnès Maltais.
