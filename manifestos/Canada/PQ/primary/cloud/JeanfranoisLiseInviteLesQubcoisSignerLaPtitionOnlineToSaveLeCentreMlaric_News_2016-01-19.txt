Quebec - The member for Rosemont and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of social services and prevention, Jean-François Lisée, calls for solidarity and invites Quebecers to sign the petition he is sponsoring demanding the cancellation of the cuts to social assistance for drug addicts undergoing therapy at a center like Mélaric, which had to close its doors because of the Liberal cuts. &quot;This closure is a direct hit with an already vulnerable clientele,&quot; said Lisée.
“Although on numerous occasions we have warned ministers Hamad and Charlebois of the dramatic consequences of their cuts, they persist and sign in setting up what has become a machine to create homelessness. Remember that we have unveiled three reports showing that the Liberal government is solely responsible for the closure of Mélaric and the financial difficulties with which several other centers must contend, ”added the Member for Rosemont.
“Let&#39;s take action. Let us unite our voices to denounce the selective austerity of the Liberal government by signing the petition to save Mélaric and maintain accessibility to services for all people who courageously choose to start therapy in order to overcome addiction, ”concluded Jean. -François Lisée.
To sign the petition, go to the National Assembly&#39;s website at http://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/exprimez-votre-opinion/petition/Petition-5741/index.html .
