Montreal, January 19, 2017 - While Françoise David today announced her retirement from political life, the leader of the official opposition, Jean-François Lisée, praised the commitment and passion of the Member for Gouin and co-spokesperson for Québec solidaire.
&quot;Having devoted her life to the advancement of causes close to her heart - social justice, the environment, equality between women and men, the sovereignty of Quebec - Françoise David has become one of the figures most prominent in the Quebec political landscape. A feminist activist, she has worked in several groups, in addition to leading the Fédération des femmes du Québec. Françoise&#39;s daily feat was to give a strong voice to women, the underprivileged and the forgotten. Among other things, his involvement in the organization of the March of Bread and Roses in 1995 largely contributed to the adoption of the Pay Equity Act, in addition to raising the general population&#39;s awareness of the fight against poverty and violence against women. We will also remember his fight for the automatic collection of support payments, ”said Mr. Lisée.
“We can only salute Françoise David&#39;s immense contribution as a Member of Parliament, and we know very well that her civic involvement will continue well beyond parliamentary life. As elected to the National Assembly, she focused on many issues; quite recently, moreover, she passed a bill protecting vulnerable seniors from eviction from their homes. I am convinced that this woman of conviction and dialogue will continue her fight for the most vulnerable in our society. Everyone has seen, on a daily basis, to what extent this woman has, in her spinal cord, the need to advance the common good. In my name and that of my political party, I wish him a good retirement, well deserved. Thank you, Françoise! », Expressed the leader of the official opposition.
