Quebec - Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, and Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Marie Malavoy, are happy to congratulate Kim Lamarre, who today won a bronze medal in acrobatic descent (slopestyle ).
“Kim Lamarre has given herself body and soul for years to finally realize her dream of participating in these Games. All Quebecers are honored to be represented in Sochi by such a talented and inspiring young woman. His performance and determination must be celebrated, ”said the Prime Minister.
Kim Lamarre is a model of courage. Victim of a major knee injury, she overcame this ordeal to face the best in her discipline at the Olympic Games. She is the granddaughter of Ginette Séguin, a skier who made her mark during the Cortina d&#39;Ampezzo Games in 1956.
“Kim Lamarre is really the caliber of champions. His achievement and his family history teach us one thing: the desire to move and to surpass oneself is transmitted by example. This is what could not be more inspiring for all of us! Said Minister Malavoy.
We invite you to watch the figure skating competitions tomorrow.
