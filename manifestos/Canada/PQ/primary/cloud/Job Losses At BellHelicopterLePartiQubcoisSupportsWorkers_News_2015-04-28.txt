Quebec - The member for Saint-Jérôme and official opposition critic for the economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, deplores the 300 layoffs carried out by the company Bell Helicopter , in Mirabel.
“We stand in solidarity with workers and their families, who are facing this bad news. These layoffs are cause for concern, especially since employees were not expecting it. The government must support them and do more than just promise them a phone call from Emploi-Québec tomorrow morning, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“The cuts to the research and development tax credit, as well as the government&#39;s refusal to restore the amounts in the last budget, are hurting the aeronautics sector. In economic matters, the liberals sail on sight, without a concrete development policy; the predictable result is a poor employment record, ”concluded the member for Saint-Jérôme.
