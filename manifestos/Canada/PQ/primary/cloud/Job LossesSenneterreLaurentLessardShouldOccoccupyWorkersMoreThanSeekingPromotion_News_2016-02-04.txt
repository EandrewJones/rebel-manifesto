Quebec - Parti Québécois forestry spokesperson Sylvain Roy is sorry for the attitude of the Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, Laurent Lessard, when 148 Tembec workers will lose their jobs next Monday, due to the announced closure of the Senneterre plant.
Following the cabinet reshuffle, Laurent Lessard told La Tribune newspaper last Saturday that he would have welcomed a promotion with pleasure. “The minister disrespects workers. He should be concerned about the jobs lost rather than his own situation. In Senneterre, there are 148 families who will soon have to deal with a difficult financial situation, and Laurent Lessard is thinking about the promotion he could have had, ”lamented Sylvain Roy.
The situation is more than appalling. In all regions of Quebec, since the minister took office, thousands of jobs have been lost, in the forest as well as in the factory. “The industry and forestry workers are still waiting for Minister Lessard to act to protect jobs. How many more factory closures is it going to take for it to budge? Its lack of vision is costing the forestry industry dearly. Before thinking of a new position, he should seriously consider the difficulties faced by workers in the regions, ”concluded the Member for Bonaventure.
