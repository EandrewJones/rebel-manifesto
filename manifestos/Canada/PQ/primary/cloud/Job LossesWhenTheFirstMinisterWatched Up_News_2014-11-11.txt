Quebec - The member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, once again called on Prime Minister Philippe Couillard to quickly table a stimulus plan for employment in Quebec. Remember that in October alone, 30,000 full-time jobs were lost; if we take stock since the Liberal Party came to power, Quebec has 82,000 fewer jobs.
While the Prime Minister admits his poor performance, his Minister of Finance announces that he will do nothing to stimulate employment in his economic and financial update. “It is incredible to hear the Minister of Finance say that the economy is accelerating as the banks revise their growth forecasts downwards. Liberal austerity has installed mistrust everywhere. The government has been letting uncertainty hang over economic programs and fiscal measures since June, so that our entrepreneurs no longer dare to hire; they are awaiting stability. This is the liberal effect: a record of mediocrity in employment. The Prime Minister only talks about one thing: his Plan Nord. However, metal prices are falling. In addition, the Plan Nord will not create jobs for several years. However, it is now that we need a boost in employment! », Declared Stéphane Bédard.
A real job recovery plan
“There are four weeks left in the parliamentary session; the Prime Minister must put an end to his inexplicable stubbornness in doing nothing in the face of the collapsing job market. Will the economic update to be presented by the government soon contain only tariff increases and other tax cuts for businesses, or will the Prime Minister finally present us with a real job recovery plan? ? », Concluded the leader of the official opposition.
