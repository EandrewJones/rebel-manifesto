Quebec - The Quebec government maintains, for the 4th consecutive year, the freeze on performance bonuses for holders of senior positions, for the 2012-2013 reference period. “Quebec is in a particular context where everyone is called to do their fair share, including those in senior positions in the public and parapublic sectors appointed by the government,” recalled the Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois.
By decree, the government is therefore suspending the granting of a performance bonus, provided for under the Policy on performance appraisal and salary review for holders of senior positions. This decision aims to maintain the return to balanced budgets and debt reduction, as announced by the Minister of Finance and the Economy, Nicolas Marceau, when the budget was tabled. “This in no way calls into question the appreciation for the exceptional achievement and performance of each person in a senior position. On the contrary, it is a concrete gesture for all taxpayers in Quebec, which calls for the solidarity of all, ”said Pauline Marois.
This freeze targets some 700 holders of senior positions who are essentially deputy ministers, assistant deputy ministers, presidents, vice-presidents and members of government agencies, and represents approximately $ 6 million in savings for Quebec.
