Jonquière - Given the new standards negotiated between the Minister of Health and the Federation of General Practitioners of Quebec, the Leader of the Official Opposition and Member of Parliament for Jonquière, Sylvain Gaudreault, called on the Premier of Quebec, Philippe Couillard, and Minister Gaétan Barrette on the subject of the survival of the Jonquière Medic organization, insisting on the ineffectiveness of a single solution for all of Quebec.
The new agreement changes the remuneration of doctors&#39; acts for home visits, complicating the recruitment and retention of those who work for Jonquière Medic, and even putting the funding of services at risk.
“Jonquière Médic is a unique formula that relieves emergency rooms by offering services to patients without a family doctor or to those who cannot have an appointment with their doctor. We are talking about 10,000 visits per year. I share the concern of the directors of Jonquière Médic. The Prime Minister must be aware that “wall to wall” solutions for all of Quebec do not work! It must insist on maintaining the decentralized and innovative services that the regions have set up to meet their specific needs, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
The Leader of the Official Opposition also recalls the many broken promises made by the Minister of Health, particularly in the area of home care. “On top of all these cuts, the Liberal government is out of touch with what is happening on the ground. The Jonquière Médic organization shared its concerns with staff in the offices of the Minister and the Prime Minister, with the only response that no changes would be made to the negotiated agreement. I invite Philippe Couillard to reconsider his decision and find a solution so that, finally, we are concerned with maintaining the particularities that work in the regions, ”concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
