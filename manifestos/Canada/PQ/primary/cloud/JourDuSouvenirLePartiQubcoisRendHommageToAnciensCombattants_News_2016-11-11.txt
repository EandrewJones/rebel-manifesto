Quebec, November 11, 2016 - November 11, 1918 was signed the armistice, which officially ended the fighting in the First World War. That day, thousands of people let their immense joy burst out, but others, just as many, mourned their loved ones. Almost 100 years later, Jean-François Lisée, leader of the official opposition, wishes to keep the memory of them alive.
“I want to highlight the bravery that marked the history of Quebec regiments, a tradition that continues. The courage of the soldiers contributes greatly to our national pride, ”declared the Leader of the Official Opposition.
In 2016, Remembrance Day takes on a broader meaning, as an opportunity to pay tribute to all the people who stood up and fought to defend our democracies, and who paid dearly for it. “We must remember the courage and dignity shown by these women and men, as well as the sacrifices they made. A veteran said: &quot;a veteran is someone who at some point in his life wrote a blank check to his country, for an amount that went so far as to give his life,&quot; &quot;he said. added Jean François Lisée.
In tribute to the soldiers wounded or missing during their military service, the leader of the official opposition deposited, this morning, a wreath of flowers at the Cross of Sacrifice, at the entrance to the Battlefields Park, in Quebec. “Quebec&#39;s motto, Je me souviens, is also that of the Royal 22e Régiment, and it makes perfect sense today,” concluded Mr. Lisée.
