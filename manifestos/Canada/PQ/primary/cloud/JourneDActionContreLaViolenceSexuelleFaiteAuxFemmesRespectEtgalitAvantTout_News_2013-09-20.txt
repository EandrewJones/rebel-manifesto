Quebec - The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Ms. Agnès Maltais, wishes to highlight the Day of Action against Sexual Violence Against Women which takes place under the theme of prostitution.
“For our government, it is important to unite our efforts so that in Quebec, gender equality is fully realized and that respect comes first and foremost. Prostitution is a form of violence against women, which undermines their dignity and security. It also remains a major obstacle to achieving equality between women and men. In this, it is the manifestation of an abuse of power which cannot be tolerated in a society which defends the values of justice and equality ”, stated Minister Maltais.
The Minister welcomes the involvement of women&#39;s groups in countering forms of violence against women, including sexual exploitation. This involvement is not without inspiring government interventions in this area.
More generally, the Government of Quebec has taken several actions in recent years to counter violence against women. The 2008-2013 government action plan on sexual assault, which brings together 100 commitments under the responsibility of ten signatory departments, has made it possible to make significant progress.
Among the actions stemming from this plan, let us recall the creation of a toll-free referral line intended to direct victims of sexual assault, their relatives and the intervention community to the appropriate services, the carrying out of a government campaign. awareness of sexual assault as well as prevention of recruitment of young people for the purpose of sexual exploitation in the context of street gangs.
In addition, a government action plan aimed at preventing and countering sexual exploitation should see the light of day by the end of 2014.
