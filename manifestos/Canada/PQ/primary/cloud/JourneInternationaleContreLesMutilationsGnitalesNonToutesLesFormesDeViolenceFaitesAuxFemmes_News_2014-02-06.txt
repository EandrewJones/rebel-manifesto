Quebec - On the occasion of the International Day against Genital Mutilation, the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Ms. Agnès Maltais, wishes to reiterate the government&#39;s desire to fight against all forms of violence against women, including so-called honor crimes, including genital mutilation.
“The Government of Quebec considers genital mutilation as an attack on the physical integrity of the person and on human dignity. In this regard, we are currently carefully studying the recommendations stemming from the opinion of the Council on the Status of Women tabled last November on so-called honor crimes, in particular the elements concerning genital mutilation. These mutilations are criminal and do not have to be ”, argued Ms. Maltais.
Today, around the world, more than 125 million women and girls have undergone some form of genital mutilation, according to UNICEF. The organization estimates that some 30 million girls are at risk of the same fate over the next decade because the practice remains common in many countries.
Remember that the International Day against Genital Mutilation is a reminder every year, on February 6, that millions of girls have suffered or will suffer a fundamental violation of their human rights.
