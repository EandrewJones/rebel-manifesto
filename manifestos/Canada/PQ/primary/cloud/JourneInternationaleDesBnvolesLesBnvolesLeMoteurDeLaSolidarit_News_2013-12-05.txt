“By presenting the third pillar of the government last October, we reaffirmed that solidarity is a collective wealth and that mutual aid and altruism can bring enormous benefits to Quebec. This great wealth that is our solidarity, nothing represents it better than the volunteers, young and old, who work to improve the daily lives of their fellow citizens ”, argued Ms. Maltais.
For the government, therefore, it is important to underline the essential commitment of the women and men who, every day, make these gestures of generosity which amply deserve the testimony of gratitude given to them today.
“According to the latest statistics, more than 2.4 million people in Quebec give of their time. Each year, some 300 million hours are offered in this way, particularly in the health, education or sport and leisure sectors, ”added the Minister, also chair of the Ministerial Solidarity Committee. .
Remember that the International Volunteer Day, decreed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1985, underlines the essential work of volunteers in all countries.
Community organizations supervise several volunteers and the Quebec government is committed to strengthening the support it already provides them. Moreover, it has made it one of the three orientations of its pillar Solidarity: a wealth for Quebec.
&quot;In this regard, a consultation is currently underway with organizations to allow the development of a new government action plan for community action and volunteer action,&quot; said Minister Maltais.
Solidarity is part of a vision that is both human and inclusive, which combines State support with social commitment.
