Quebec - In this Quebec Family Week, taking place from May 11 to 17, the MNA for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, as well as the MNA for Terrebonne and family spokesperson, Mathieu Traversy, take advantage of the International Day of Families, which will take place on May 15, to reaffirm their support and to invite the government to review the policies that affect them.
“On behalf of my fellow members of the Parti Québécois, I would like to salute all the fathers and mothers of Quebec for their daily commitment. For a parent, in 2015, the challenges are many and demanding. Because of the cuts that the government is imposing in the services intended for them and the increase in several tariffs, including those for childcare services, Quebec families must redouble their ingenuity. However, they can count on the support of the Parti Québécois, which will continue to defend their interests in the face of this government which is turning a deaf ear, ”declared Stéphane Bédard.
In the same vein, Mathieu Traversy underlined the extent to which the theme chosen this year, Reconciling family and work, highlights the inconsistency of the government. “While all stakeholders are pleading for a better work-family balance, the government of Philippe Couillard is determined to reduce to crumbs the initiatives and programs aimed at facilitating it. If it was logical and genuinely concerned with the well-being of families, instead of slashing the budgets allocated to the action plan on work-family reconciliation under the government policy for equality between women and men, such as he did so in the last budget, he would look for ways to strengthen Quebec&#39;s family policy, ”he said.
Finally, Stéphane Bédard and Mathieu Traversy invited Quebec families to participate in large numbers in the activities planned as part of the 20th Quebec Family Week, an initiative of the Network for a Quebec Family.
