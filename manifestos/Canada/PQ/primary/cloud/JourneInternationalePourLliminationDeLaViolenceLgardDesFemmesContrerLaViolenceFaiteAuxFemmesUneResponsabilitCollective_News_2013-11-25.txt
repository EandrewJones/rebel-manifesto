Quebec - The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Mrs. Agnès Maltais, wishes to recall, on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence in Regarding women, that preventing and countering degrading acts that affect people with their dignity is a collective responsibility.
“Violence, whatever its form, is unacceptable. We must end it. To get there, we have to work together. We are all responsible. This is not a problem that concerns only women, but the whole of society, ”said Minister Maltais.
In 2012, women accounted for 80% of victims of offenses committed in a conjugal context and for 83% of victims of crimes of a sexual nature. In addition to these specific cases, there are other forms of violence of which women are also the main victims, in particular those linked to honor and sexual exploitation. Thus, crimes against the person, particularly those committed against women, constitute an important part of the various police and judicial interventions in our society.
“Over the decades, the situation of Quebec women has improved in many ways. However, despite the progress made, violence continues to hamper women in their search for autonomy and equality and these situations must end, ”Minister Maltais concluded.
