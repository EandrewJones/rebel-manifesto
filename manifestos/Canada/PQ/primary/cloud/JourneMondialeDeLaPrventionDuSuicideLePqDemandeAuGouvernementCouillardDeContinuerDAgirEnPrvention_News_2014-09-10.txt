Québec - On the occasion of the 12th World Suicide Prevention Day, the member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for prevention, Jean-François Lisée, asks the Minister for Rehabilitation, to Youth Protection and Public Health, Lucie Charlebois, to step up suicide prevention efforts.
The latest statistics show three suicides a day in Quebec, while only one is already one too many. It is therefore essential that the government continue to play its role in prevention, and the Parti Québécois would like to remind it on this day of mobilization.
“The whole of society must be involved; It is high time to support the efforts of interveners and organizations that work every day to better prevent suicide. As for the government, it must reassure Quebeckers about the sums invested in this matter, especially in the context of austerity and budget cuts that we are experiencing, ”said Jean-Francois Lisée. It should be remembered that in its report published on September 4, the World Health Organization was concerned about the lack of space given to suicide prevention in public policies.
The member also took the opportunity to underline the daily efforts of the team of the Association Québécoise de Prévention du Suicide (AQPS); its essential work really contributes to transforming and improving the lives of vulnerable people and their loved ones. However, the AQPS absolutely needs the support of the government to carry out its mission.
Jean-Francois Lisée recalls in closing that competent resources are available for the population, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, through the free intervention line 1 866 APPELLE (277-3553).
