Quebec - Official Opposition spokesperson for Seniors, Harold LeBel, wishes to highlight the importance of World Day Against Elder Abuse. For the occasion, the member for Rimouski reiterates his request to the Government of Quebec to hold the Estates General on the living conditions of the elderly.
IN SHORT
“I would like to take this day to underline the importance of continuing to fight against all forms of mistreatment targeting seniors. I think everyone agrees that Bill 115 was a step in the right direction; however, it is not believed that it will definitively solve all abuse problems. It saddens me to think that almost every week a new case of abuse is revealed to us. Just a few days ago, in Drummondville, we learned that dozens of seniors had been deprived of baths due to a lack of personnel. The attendants were simply out of breath, completely overloaded. Abuse includes those kinds of situations that you have to fight against. The cases of institutional mistreatment are more and more numerous, and it is the lack of resources in the network that is to blame, ”said Harold LeBel.
“We know that the issue of the living conditions of seniors particularly affects Quebecers. Every day, on the ground, people tell us that the abuse must stop. This is why our demand for the Estates General to take place is unanimous among the opposition parties and among the groups of seniors. I spent the last two days at the FADOQ convention, which has more than 500,000 members; like us, they want the government to get active. The enthusiasm generated by our petition also proves it. In barely a week, we have collected nearly 12,000 signatures, ”added the member for Rimouski.
The official opposition invites people to be heard by signing the petition.
