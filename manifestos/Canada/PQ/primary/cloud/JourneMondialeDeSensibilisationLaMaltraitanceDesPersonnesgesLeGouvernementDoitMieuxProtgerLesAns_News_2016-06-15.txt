Quebec– Harold LeBel, Member of Parliament for Rimouski and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois pour les Seniors, and Nicole Léger, Member of Parliament for Pointe-aux-Trembles and spokesperson for the Conseil du trésor, marked World Abuse Awareness Day seniors.
“This day is an opportunity to remember that too many vulnerable people are victims of abuse and that efforts must be made to stop this abuse. We demand that the government broaden the scope of Bill 87, An Act to facilitate the disclosure of wrongdoing in public bodies, in order to adequately protect the elderly, whether they are housed in CHSLDs, intermediate resources or family type, in a private seniors&#39; residence or receiving home care, ”said Harold LeBel.
“Bill 87, which is currently under detailed study, does not adequately protect the elderly, since it only targets public and private institutions under agreement. In short, the government would keep thousands of seniors without protection, thereby creating two categories of seniors. We will fight so that all vulnerable people, including the elderly, are protected from abuse and that all cases of mistreatment can be denounced without delay. We need a real framework bill to protect whistleblowers, ”added Nicole Léger.
“The Liberal government has chosen to protect only one category of seniors. This awareness day should bring to the top of our concerns the situation experienced by too many of them each year; their dignity is at stake. At the Parti Québécois, we will continue to deploy the necessary energies so that all means are implemented to stop elder abuse, ”concluded Harold LeBel.
