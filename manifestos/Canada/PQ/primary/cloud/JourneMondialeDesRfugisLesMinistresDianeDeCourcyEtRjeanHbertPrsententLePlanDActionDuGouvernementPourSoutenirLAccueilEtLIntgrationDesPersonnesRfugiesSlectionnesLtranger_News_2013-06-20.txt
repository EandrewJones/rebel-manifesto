Montreal - The Minister of Immigration and Cultural Communities and Minister responsible for the Charter of the French Language, Ms. Diane De Courcy, and the Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for the Estrie region, Mr. Réjean Hébert, highlighted the World Refugee Day by launching the Quebec government&#39;s action plan for the reception and integration of refugees selected abroad - 2013-2016. This launch took place at the Community and Cultural Center of the Borough of Jacques-Cartier, in Sherbrooke, in the presence of Mr. Serge Cardin, Member of Parliament for Sherbrooke, and many partners. Mr. Cardin represented Mrs. Agnès Maltais, Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity and Minister of Labor.
“Quebec&#39;s tradition of welcoming and hospitality to refugees reflects well the values of solidarity, respect for human rights, equity and generosity that animate the Quebec population. Compared to the countries and territories that host refugees, Quebec ranks fifth after the United States, the rest of Canada, Australia and Sweden. Recognized around the world as a land of immigration, Quebec attaches great importance to humanitarian immigration, ”said Minister Diane De Courcy. Between 2008 and 2012, Quebec took in 8,245 state-assisted refugees and 2,273 people who received collective sponsorship.
The Government of Quebec&#39;s Action Plan includes 21 measures that revolve around four orientations:
This action plan is the result of the concerted work of the main ministries that offer services to refugees selected abroad: the Ministry of Immigration and Cultural Communities, the Ministry of Health and Social Services, the Ministry of of Education, Leisure and Sport and the Ministry of Employment and Social Solidarity. It is also the result of the regional consultation of ministerial, institutional and community partners that took place in 2011-2012 and of the visits that Minister Diane De Courcy made in 2012-2013 to the 17 regions of Quebec.
“This action plan responds to the need to rethink our services based on the needs that have evolved with the international context. In recent years, we have noted substantial changes in the profile of refugees. These people have spent a large part of their lives in refugee camps and have suffered various traumas. Their needs are great and require better coordination between the services we offer them, ”said Ms. De Courcy.
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 43.3 million people have been forcibly displaced due to armed conflict and persecution. Of this number, 10.4 million are refugees recognized by the Office of the High Commissioner, 46% of whom are children.
A few days before World Refugee Day, the city of Sherbrooke welcomed 32 young Rwandans who had been refugees in Congo for twenty years. They fled Rwanda in 1994 during the genocide that killed nearly a million people. Thanks to a program of the High Commission for the orphans victims of this genocide, they benefited from scholarships which allow them to continue their studies and from basic medical coverage.
“Cohesion and collaboration between the different actors are essential, because they make it possible to offer an optimal path of integration. With this new action plan, the health and social services network will be better equipped to continue its work of planning and organizing services for refugees and asylum seekers. It will be able to do so in consultation with regional players who play a key role in the integration of refugees into Quebec society, ”said Minister Réjean Hébert.
“This action plan perpetuates Quebec&#39;s tradition of openness and generosity towards the most vulnerable people on our planet and we are very proud of it. Welcoming refugees is a humanitarian action that has achieved consensus throughout society. We will work with our partners to ensure that our support matches the courage of these people who fled threats, persecution and conflict to rebuild their lives in Quebec, ”concluded Minister Diane De Courcy.
