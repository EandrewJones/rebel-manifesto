Quebec - On the occasion of World Tourism Day 2012, which is held under the theme &quot;Tourism and sustainable energy: propelling sustainable development&quot;, the Minister for Tourism and Minister responsible for the Bas-St-Laurent region, Mr. Pascal Bérubé, is happy to underline this important event.
“The tourism industry is a great source of wealth that compares favorably with several high-tech sectors of the economy. With 11.4 billion estimated tourism receipts in 2011, a contribution of 2.4% to the gross domestic product (GDP) of Quebec, 423,000 jobs in sectors associated with tourism, the 29,500 Quebec tourism companies are undoubtedly at the heart of our economic development ”, declared Minister Bérubé.
“Global tourism growth is expected to remain around 3.5% over the next few years, which means nearly 400 million new travelers worldwide. Quebec must take advantage of this growth with a view to sustainable development in order to ensure the sustainability of our landscapes and our attractions. This development must call for collective responsibility in order to protect our environment for the benefit of future generations and with respect and well-being of local communities. In addition, the theme chosen this year is perfectly in line with our government&#39;s orientations in terms of clean and sustainable energy, ”added the Minister.
Under the aegis of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) since 1980, the main objective of World Tourism Day is to make the international community aware of the importance of tourism and its social, cultural, political and economic value.
