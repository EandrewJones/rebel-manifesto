Quebec - On the occasion of World Tourism Day, celebrated since 1980, at the initiative of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the Minister for Tourism, Mr. Pascal Bérubé, is pleased to mark the 50th anniversary the creation of the Ministry of Tourism, Hunting and Fishing. It was in 1963 that the Hotel Industry Act was adopted, and that Quebec intensified its advertising campaigns in the United States under the theme &quot;La Belle Province&quot;.
Since April 4, 1963, our tourist destination has come a long way, going through the year of the Expo, in 1967, when Quebec opened up to the world and created a post of tourist commissioner in Paris. In 1979, the Ministry of Tourism officially recognized the network of regional tourist associations (ATR) as privileged partners in the regions. In 1984, the Palais des congrès de Montréal was inaugurated. The same year, “Bonjour Québec” became the trade mark for tourism and was followed, in 1999, by the launch of the official transactional site of the Ministry of Tourism: BonjourQuébec.com. In 2008, the Strategy for sustainable development and promotion of international cruises on the St. Lawrence River was launched, creating six new stopovers.
“Today, tourism is one of the world&#39;s leading industries and, moreover, a growing economic sector. We must therefore continue our efforts and work in concert with our partners to take advantage of this growth and to offer our visitors an original tourist experience of international caliber, ”declared Minister Bérubé.
In Quebec, the tourism industry represents 2.5% of the GDP, $ 12.4 billion in tourism revenue; 29,500 companies are linked to sectors associated with tourism, generating nearly 423,000 jobs linked to the sector and 141,000 direct jobs. Quebec&#39;s fourth largest export product, tourism is an economic sector rooted in all regions of Quebec.
