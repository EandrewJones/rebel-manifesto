Quebec - The Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, and the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Agnès Maltais, highlighted the National Day of Remembrance and Action against the violence against women. In Quebec, December 6 remains anchored in collective memory. This day commemorates the tragedy that occurred at École Polytechnique de Montréal in 1989 and pays tribute to the fourteen murdered young women as well as their families and loved ones, who have been forever marked.
“This day is an opportunity to remind ourselves that the events of 24 years ago do not reflect our convictions as Quebeckers. We are a people who believe in equality, who believe that girls and women are full participants in the construction of society. It is, among other things, by promoting these fundamental values of respect for physical and psychological integrity that we will be able to ensure the safety of everyone, in all walks of life, ”said the Premier.
In this sense, the government is continuing its efforts to ensure that women have access to the professions of the future and can fully participate in decision-making bodies as well as in economic life, in particular as entrepreneurs. It also implements many actions so that they can live in safety.
“We must do everything to ensure that such an event never happens again. The fight against violence against women is a collective responsibility. On this day, let us remember this tragedy as an unacceptable event with still painful consequences, ”added Minister Maltais.
