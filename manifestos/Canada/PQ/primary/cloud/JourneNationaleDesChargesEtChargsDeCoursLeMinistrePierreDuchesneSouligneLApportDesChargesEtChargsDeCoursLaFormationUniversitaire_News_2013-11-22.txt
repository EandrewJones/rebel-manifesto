Quebec - The Minister of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology, Mr. Pierre Duchesne, takes advantage of the National Day of Lecturers and Lecturers to underline their important contribution in the academic career of students.
“Lecturers are essential players in university teaching staff. Their expertise and diverse experience contribute to a quality university education. Thanks to their passion for teaching, they pass on knowledge to students in order to ensure succession in all spheres of activity, ”said Minister Duchesne.
These people give most of the classes in the evenings and on weekends. They are also very present outside urban centers, thus allowing better accessibility to training for adults and students throughout Quebec.
“The personal and collective involvement of the lecturers therefore contributes to the academic success of the students they train. They guarantee better accessibility to higher education for those who are willing and able to pursue it. It is important to take this day to underline it, ”added Minister Duchesne.
The contribution of the lecturers was also pointed out during the Summit on Higher Education. Thus, 50% of the reinvestment will be devoted to hiring professors, lecturers and non-teaching staff. Part of the university reinvestment could translate into more than 2,000 additional lecturers.
On November 22, the National Federation of Teachers of Quebec (FNEEQ-CSN) marks National Day for Lecturers by launching the second phase of a promotion campaign that began in 2010. Under the theme I teach at the ET… university, this progressive campaign shows the great diversity of the profiles of the lecturers and makes it possible to publicize their professional expertise, an essential component to the success of the universities&#39; training mission.
