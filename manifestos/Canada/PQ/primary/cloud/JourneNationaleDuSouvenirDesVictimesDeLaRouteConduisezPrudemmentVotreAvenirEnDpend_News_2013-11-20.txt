Quebec - The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, underlined, by a statement to the National Assembly, the National Day of Remembrance of Road Victims, held this year under the theme Drive safely, your future depends on it.
“I invite the entire population of Quebec to honor the memory of road victims and to remember all those who have been affected by these tragedies. I also call on all road users to exercise the utmost caution in their journeys in order to further reduce the number of victims, ”said the Minister.
Indeed, although the 2012 road record is the best record in the last 65 years, road safety remains an essential issue and a major concern for many citizens. “Thanks to the combined efforts of all partners and road users, we are seeing a clear improvement, but the gains are fragile. This is why it is important to relentlessly pursue awareness-raising actions and support the adoption of safe driving behaviors, ”declared the President and CEO of the Société de l&#39;assurance automobile du Québec, Ms. Nathalie Tremblay. .
Recall that in October 2005, the United Nations adopted a resolution calling on governments to establish a commemorative day for road victims, which is now observed in many countries.
