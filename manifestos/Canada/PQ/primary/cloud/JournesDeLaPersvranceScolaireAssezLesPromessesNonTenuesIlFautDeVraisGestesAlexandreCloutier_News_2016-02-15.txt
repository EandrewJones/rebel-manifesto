Quebec - This morning at a press briefing, the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of education, research and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, was accompanied by several representatives of organizations fighting against dropping out of school in the region de la Chaudière-Appalaches to denounce the consequences of government cuts in the area.
“People from the Montmagny-L&#39;Islet region came to testify and send a cry from the heart to the government. The projects they set up are an example of success. In a particularly disadvantaged environment, marked by a high dropout rate, a community took action to reverse the situation. The two formidable initiatives Biblio mobile and L&#39;ÉcoRéussite are now threatened by the Couillard government cuts, ”said Alexandre Cloutier.
As early as last September, the Parti Québécois denounced the major cuts made by the Liberals in the network of regional organizations fighting against dropping out of school. The government then undertook to restore all of the sums cut.
“Five months later, the sums are still pending and the consequences continue to be felt on the ground. Hooked on School Days are a unique opportunity to make our young people aware of the importance of obtaining a diploma. Unfortunately, this year, in several regions of Quebec, no activity will be organized, because several organizations have seen their budgets decrease alarmingly or are completely closed, ”concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
