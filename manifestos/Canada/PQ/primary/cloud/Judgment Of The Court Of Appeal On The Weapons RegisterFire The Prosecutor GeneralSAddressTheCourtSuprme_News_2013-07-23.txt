Quebec - The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, said he was surprised and very disappointed with the decision of the Court of Appeal rendered today on his request for a stay in the register file firearms. The Court refused to issue an order preventing the destruction of Quebec data included in the firearms registry and obliging federal authorities to maintain access and update them pending the Supreme Court of Canada&#39;s decision.
&quot;We will file in the next few hours before the Supreme Court a request for a stay which will be combined with a notice of application for leave to appeal in order to ensure that Quebec data is not destroyed by the federal government and remains accessible and updates during the call. We have informed the attorneys of the Attorney General of Canada of our intention to proceed with a request for a stay in order to prevent the destruction of the data, ‚Äùsaid Bertrand St-Arnaud.
Let us recall that the government of Quebec had filed a request to preserve and preserve the data of the registration certificates of long guns (non-restricted firearms) of Quebec citizens who are registered in the Canadian firearms registry.
