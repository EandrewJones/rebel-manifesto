Quebec - The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, said he was disappointed with the decision of the Court of Appeal rendered today on the non-restricted firearms registry.
The Court of Appeal thus overturned a judgment of the Superior Court which had won the case in Quebec by rendering inoperative the provision of the federal law which required the destruction of data relating to the registration of non-restricted firearms.
The minister said he will appeal this decision to the Supreme Court and immediately submit a stay application to ensure that Quebec data is not destroyed by the federal government and remains accessible and updated during this appeal.
“There is a consensus in Quebec regarding the registration of firearms. All the political parties represented in the National Assembly defend this unanimous position and strongly oppose the federal government&#39;s decision to abolish the firearms registry. We will therefore appeal to the Supreme Court of today&#39;s decision, ”said the Minister of Justice.
Let us recall that the government of Quebec had filed a request to preserve and preserve the data of the registration certificates of long guns (non-restricted firearms) of Quebec citizens who are registered in the Canadian firearms registry.
