Quebec - “Although it is reassuring that the principle of deconfessionalization of schools is maintained in this judgment, the fact remains that the content of the course and the way it is taught raise many questions. The Minister of Education, Line Beauchamp, has an obligation to give us an update and make adjustments. &quot;
This is what Sylvain Gaudreault, MP for Jonquière and official opposition spokesman for primary and secondary education, said in response to the Supreme Court&#39;s ruling on ethics today. and religious culture.
The Parti Québécois recalls that this judgment completes the process of deconfessionalization of education initiated by the Parti Québécois government at the end of the 90s. However, for three years, like many parents and interveners, we observes a drift of the initial objectives of this course. The Parti Québécois believes it is necessary to transmit knowledge about the history of religions and that a preponderant place be given to our historical realities.
“Since 2009, every year, during the study of the Ministry of Education&#39;s appropriations, we have requested an evaluation of the ethics and religious culture course. Each time, Liberal education ministers have dodged the question. It is time to do it and it is urgent, ”concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
