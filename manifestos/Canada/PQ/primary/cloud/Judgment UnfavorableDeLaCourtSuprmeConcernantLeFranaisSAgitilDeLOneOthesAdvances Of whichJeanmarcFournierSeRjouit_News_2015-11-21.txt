Quebec - In reaction to the Supreme Court ruling, which gives the right to Alberta and Saskatchewan to enact their laws and regulations only in English, the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of Quebec-Canada relations and Francophonie d&#39;Amérique, Stéphane Bergeron, and the spokesperson for the Charter of the French language, Maka Kotto, note that Canadian bilingualism remains still and always an illusion.
“This decision weakens the rights of Francophones outside Quebec, which remain insufficient. Now, the highest judicial body has confirmed that it is acceptable that French speakers do not have access to official documents in their language. Meanwhile, Jean-Marc Fournier shouts out to repeat to anyone who wants to hear him that the Canadian Francophonie is doing better. I can&#39;t wait to see how he goes about minimizing this obvious setback. I dare to hope that Alberta and Saskatchewan will want to show the necessary openness to go further than what this judgment prescribes, in order to allow French-speaking litigants to properly defend their rights on their territory, ”declared Stéphane Bergeron. .
“Quebec, whose official language is French, has always shown the greatest respect for the English-speaking minority. It is deplorable that francophones outside Quebec are not entitled to the same respect as anglophones in Quebec, who benefit from institutions providing them with services in their language, ”concluded Maka Kotto.
