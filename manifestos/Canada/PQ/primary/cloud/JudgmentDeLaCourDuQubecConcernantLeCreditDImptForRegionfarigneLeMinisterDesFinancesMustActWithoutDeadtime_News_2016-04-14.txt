Quebec - The deputy for Duplessis and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of northern development, Lorraine Richard, is concerned about the dangerous precedent created by a judgment of the Court of Quebec, rendered on December 18, regarding the application of the tax deduction for an individual living in a remote region.
“This morning, we questioned the Minister of Finance about the judgment rendered by the Court of Quebec allowing workers who fly-in / fly-out to be entitled to the tax deduction for an individual who lives in a remote region. This judgment creates a case law, a loophole in the law. This is a precedent that could have significant consequences in the regions, but also a financial impact for the government. The purpose of the tax deduction was to create an incentive to attract families to remote areas. Grant this credit to workers in a defly-in / fly-out situation against all the objectives that led to the creation of this tax measure. Thus, instead of encouraging workers and their families to settle in the regions, we are rewarding workers who are just passing through, ”explained Lorraine Richard.
“The Minister of Finance must act without delay, by the end of the session, to plug the hole created by the judgment of last December. A refusal to act promptly will be interpreted as an admission that the objective sought by the liberal government, that the liberal vision of northern development, is a tax credit to reward the fly-in / fly-out. Is that the Plan Nord of Philippe Couillard? ”, Concluded the member for Duplessis.
