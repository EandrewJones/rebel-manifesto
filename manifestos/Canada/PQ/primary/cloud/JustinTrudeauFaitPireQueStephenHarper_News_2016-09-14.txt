Québec, September 14, 2016 - Stéphane Bergeron, MP for Verchères, Chief Whip of the Official Opposition and Parti Québécois spokesperson for Quebec-Canada relations, and the MP for Taillon and spokesperson for health, Diane Lamarre, protested against the fact that the federal government intends to maintain the cuts in health transfers from the Harper government, in addition to adding conditions.
“During the election campaign, Justin Trudeau won support by denouncing the Conservative Party&#39;s health cuts. Today, we discover that the honeyed promises of the Canadian Prime Minister were nothing but wind. Not only is Ottawa maintaining the reductions but, in addition, it is adding conditions to the transfers. It is simply unacceptable! », Declared Stéphane Bergeron.
“One thing is certain: Quebeckers are in the best position to determine where their health needs are. In addition, the Trudeau government is literally interfering in a field of exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec. This money is not that of the federal government, but that of the people of Quebec, which is too often forgotten. And neither Gaétan Barrette nor Philippe Couillard succeed in preventing the federal government from imposing its views, ”added Diane Lamarre.
“Before coming to power, Justin Trudeau said on several occasions that he wanted a dialogue with Quebec and the provinces. We can now see his true face: a centralizing Prime Minister, who does not respect the powers of the Government of Quebec, yet much better placed than him to know his own health needs. Is it necessary to remember that the federal government does not manage a single civilian hospital? Faced with such an attitude, it is high time that the liberal government of Philippe Couillard finally grafted a backbone! », Concluded the member for Verchères.
