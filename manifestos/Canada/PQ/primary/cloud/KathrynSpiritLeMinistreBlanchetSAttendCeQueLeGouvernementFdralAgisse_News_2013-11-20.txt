Quebec - The Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet, asks the federal government to act quickly to ensure that corrective work is carried out on the ship Kathryn Spirit, so that the latter could leave Beauharnois quickly.
The Minister made it clear that, for its part, the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks fully assumes the responsibilities incumbent upon it under the Environment Quality Act, by ensuring that the vessel presents no risk of environmental contamination. However, it is Transport Canada that monitors the corrective work required to lift the ban on departure that it itself formulated on June 6, 2012.
“I therefore expect the federal government to exercise the utmost rigor in this matter. We remain ready to act if any risk to the health of citizens or to the quality of the environment is detected, ”said Minister Blanchet, who thus joins his voice to that of the Member for Beauharnois, Mr. Guy Leclair, who has been calling for rapid action from the federal government for some time. “We cannot let this worrying situation drag on for the citizens of Beauharnois. We are asking for swift action so that this wreck finally leaves our shores, ”declared Mr. Leclair.
The Government of Quebec is currently in communication with the representative of the shipowner, the City of Beauharnois, Transport Canada, the Canadian Coast Guard, the St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation and Environment Canada to ensure that the preparatory work for the departure of the ship is carried out in compliance with the Environment Quality Act.
