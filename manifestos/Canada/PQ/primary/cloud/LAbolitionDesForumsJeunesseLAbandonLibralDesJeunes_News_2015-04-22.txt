Quebec - The member for Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, deplored the decision of the Government of Quebec to abolish the forums regional youth.
“This is the end of an important model of consultation in all regions of Quebec. Youth forums are run by young people committed to their community, having at heart the social and public issues of their community. Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, responsible for youth issues, was not even present when his government made this sad announcement. What has he done for the youth since his arrival? Asked the spokesperson.
“We undress Pierre to dress Paul, but with fewer resources. We have always defended the youth employment centers and we will continue to do so. However, today we are losing the important expertise of forums in terms of governance and citizen participation, among others. This decision is all the sadder as it comes on the very day when the National Assembly marks the 75th anniversary of women&#39;s right to vote and to stand for election; in fact, more than 60% of the members of the boards of directors of youth forums are women, ”added Dave Turcotte.
The deputy also underlines that the budgets granted to the regional youth investment fund, administered by and for young people, have been reduced by this liberal decision. This is a $ 5 million cut.
“We have already seen this way of doing things: we abolish a regional consultation tool, and we transfer less money to another. At the end of the day, it is the citizens who lose out. Obviously, the Liberal government does not care about concertation. We can only deplore these ways of acting, in particular the fact that we left uncertainty for a long time before finally abolishing the youth forums, ”concluded the member for Saint-Jean.
