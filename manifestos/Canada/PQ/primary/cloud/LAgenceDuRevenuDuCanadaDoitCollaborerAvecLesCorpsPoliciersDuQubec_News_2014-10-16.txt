Québec, October 16, 2014 - Stéphane Bergeron, MP for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, as well as the MP for Matane-Matapédia and public security spokesperson, Pascal Bérubé, ask the Liberal government to intervene with the federal government so that the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) collaborates and transmits information to the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal, just as it does with the other police forces in Quebec.
“The CRA is challenging a justice of the peace order. Instead of going to court, she should obey and cooperate. We are also calling on the federal Minister of Revenue, Kerry-Lynne D. Findlay, so that the CRA can transmit all the relevant information to Quebec police forces. For a better fight against crime and tax evasion, we have the right to expect full cooperation from the CRA, ”declared Stéphane Bergeron.
MEPs call on the ministers of Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Jean-Marc Fournier, and of public security, Lise Thériault, to intervene directly with their federal counterparts so that the Harper government calls the CRA to order.
“The fight against underground economies requires full cooperation between law enforcement authorities and the RCAF. Why refuse to collaborate with the Montreal police officers? Are we to understand that for the federal authorities, the police forces of Quebec are not as trustworthy as the RCMP? With the many fraud investigations currently underway in Quebec, all stakeholders must get involved in order for justice to be done, ”concluded Pascal Bérubé.
