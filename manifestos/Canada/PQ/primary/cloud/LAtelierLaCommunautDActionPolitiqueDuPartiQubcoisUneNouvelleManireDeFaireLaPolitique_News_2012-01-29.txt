Montreal - Under the theme Changeons la politique, the national council of the Parti Québécois, which is held at the weekend in Montreal, was the opportunity to make public L&#39;Atelier, the political action community of the Parti Québécois, unique in Quebec and Canada.
Open to all, L&#39;Atelier is the virtual meeting place for supporters and activists of the Parti Québécois who wish to contribute, in the field, to the achievement of the objectives of the largest political movement in Quebec.
“The Workshop is a tool, an infrastructure that will require sweat to function at full capacity. It will not only allow us to play politics differently by giving citizens a voice and interacting with them, but also to better organize ourselves to go out, talk, convince - which is the strength of the Parti Québécois. Everyone can be a maker of change. More than ever, change starts with you, ”said Yves-François Blanchet, Member of Parliament for Drummond and spokesperson for L&#39;Atelier, concluding the unveiling of L&#39;Atelier.
Indeed, both a tool for mobilizing and organizing political action in the field and an online portal for disseminating the activities and positions of the Parti Québécois, L&#39;Atelier places the citizen at the heart of change. Thanks to this dashboard enriching the volunteer involvement within the Parti Québécois, the users of L&#39;Atelier - the artisans - will have all the necessary means to achieve the objectives of the Parti Québécois in the field, to the best of their talents and of their motivations.
“With a few clicks of the mouse, artisans can organize all kinds of activities, from planning and attendance, to sending reminders and providing feedback from participants. Holding a kitchen assembly, organizing a training meeting, going door-to-door or renewing membership cards has never been easier to achieve. To change politics and restore citizens&#39; confidence in their institutions, politics must be brought closer to citizens. It is the most powerful call to action ever offered on the Quebec political web to date. This is what L&#39;Atelier offers. We can not wait for the architects of change to appropriate it, ”said Yves-François Blanchet.
