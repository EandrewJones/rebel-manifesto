Québec– The member for Labelle and official opposition critic for recreation and sports, Sylvain Pagé, as well as the member for Joliette and critic for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, ask the minister of Education, Leisure and Sport, Yves Bolduc, to take the example of his colleague Minister Jacques Daoust and back down on the liberal austerity measures that will affect Quebec&#39;s national holiday.
“This possible 20% cut in budgets, from 2016, endangers important aspects of the national holiday in all regions, in particular neighborhood festivals and those which take place in small towns and which are aimed at families. These celebrations are very important for bringing together all Quebecers, especially those who have just moved here. Liberal amateurism and improvisation continues. Minister Bolduc must confirm that the National Day budgets will be maintained, ”said Sylvain Pagé.
The member also recalls that in 2004, the Liberal government of Jean Charest also cut by 15% the subsidies dedicated to the national holiday. “Why do the Liberals always attack Quebec pride? &quot;, he added.
“Everything that touches Quebec&#39;s identity, everything that makes us different, is brushed aside by this government, be it culturally, linguistically, socially or economically. After the abolition of research chairs in culture and language, the cancellation of college history lessons, the government&#39;s refusal to use the .quebec suffix on the Web, the Prime Minister&#39;s speech in English only on on the international scene, it is the turn of the national holiday to pay for the Liberal government&#39;s desire to make Quebec a province like any other, ”concluded Véronique Hivon.
