Quebec - In light of recent employment figures for August, the Member for Saint-Jean and Official Opposition Critic for Employment, Dave Turcotte, and the Member for Saint-Jérôme and economic critic, Pierre Karl Péladeau, note that the situation has stagnated in Quebec since the arrival of the Liberal government. They therefore again ask him to table, as soon as Parliament returns, a plan to support economic development and job creation.
“Only 4,100 part-time jobs were created in August, to which must be added the loss of 1,800 full-time jobs. Employment in Quebec has continued to plummet since the Liberal Party came to power. In fact, since April, 49,100 full-time jobs have been lost. All indicators are red; what is the government waiting for to act? ”Said Dave Turcotte.
The Member once again underlines the loss of nearly 300 jobs in Shawinigan, following the announcement of the upcoming closure of the Laurentide plant of Resolute Forest Products. “All the government has done is cut $ 17 million in employment assistance measures and find a new name for an approach that already existed at Investissement Québec. In short, the Liberals are trying to hide their lack of vision with a new smokescreen, ”continued Dave Turcotte.
Pierre Karl Péladeau indicates for his part that the Liberal government has thrown in the trash several economic development policies implemented by the Parti Québécois government. “The logic of liberal austerity, combined with the Prime Minister&#39;s inaction to defend Quebec&#39;s interests against Ottawa - all with the tacit support of the CAQ - is harmful for job creation in Quebec. The government must quickly come out of denial and table a clear economic development plan to support our regions, our families and our workers, ”concluded the member for Saint-Jérôme.
