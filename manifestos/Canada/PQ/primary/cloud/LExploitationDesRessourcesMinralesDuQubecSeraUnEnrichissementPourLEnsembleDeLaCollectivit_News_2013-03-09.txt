Quebec - The Marois government today tabled its information document on mining royalties in anticipation of the forum on the subject to be held on March 15. “The new regime must ensure that all Quebecers get their fair share and take full advantage of the value of the resources available in their territory. It must also allow businesses active in Quebec to be competitive, ”declared the Premier of Quebec.
Two main principles are put forward to guide the government&#39;s action in its reform. First, each company that operates a mine in Quebec will have to pay a minimum royalty to the Quebec government. Also, the mining tax system will have to be modified so that, when the profits of mining companies increase, all Quebecers benefit from a greater share of these profits.
The information document provides an overview of the current Quebec mining sector and deals with the operation of the mining tax system currently in force. It will provide food for thought during the forum. On this occasion, participants will be invited to give their opinion and propose changes to the plan in order to promote collective enrichment.
“We want to provide businesses with a stable environment conducive to investment. As we announced when the 2013-2014 Budget was tabled, we will establish a constructive dialogue with all industry stakeholders. We act responsibly and, thus, we will preserve the future of this promising business sector, ”concluded Pauline Marois.
The document The Quebec Mining Tax System is available online on the websites of the Department of Finance and the Economy, the Department of Natural Resources and the Department of the Executive Council.
