Quebec - “The CHU de Québec and the Agence de la santé et des services sociaux de la Capitale-Nationale presented to me today their respective reports on the future of the sites of the Enfant-Jésus and of L&#39;Hôtel-Dieu de Quebec. I will take the time to analyze them carefully, so as to arrive at the best decision on the various real estate solutions possible for the modernization and expansion of L&#39;Hôtel-Dieu de Québec. To do this, I asked the Société immobilière du Québec to assess the proposed scenarios, in particular from the point of view of costs and deadlines ”, declared the Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Seniors, Réjean Hébert.
The Agency&#39;s report is entitled Project for the reuse of the current premises of the Hôtel-Dieu de Québec and that of the CHU de Québec, Study of the potential of the Enfant-Jésus site. Until 2012, these two hospitals came under different administrations, namely the Center hospitalier universitaire de Québec and the Center hospitalier affilié universitaire de Québec, which, since their merger, have been united within the CHU de Québec.
&quot;In any event, the CHU de Québec, the Agence de la santé et des services sociaux de la Capitale-Nationale and the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux will show all the necessary rigor in view of the inclusion in the Quebec Infrastructure Plan of the best possible project, from clinical, real estate and budgetary perspectives, ”added Minister Hébert.
Let us recall that Minister Hébert clearly stated in his letter of March 13 to the CHU de Québec that any new real estate solution must present added value for customers and the population, demonstrate a broad consensus and ultimately respect the ability to pay Quebec taxpayers. In addition, the historic vocation of the Hôtel-Dieu de Québec had to be preserved by offering medical services on the potentially vacant site, while adding activities to maintain the economic activity of Old Québec.
