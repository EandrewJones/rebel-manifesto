Quebec, August 17, 2016 - The member for Bourget and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of immigration and cultural communities, Maka Kotto, deplores the inconsistency of the Liberal government, which wishes to increase the immigration thresholds, while &#39;it continues to cut the budgets dedicated to francization and the integration of people who choose Quebec as their host country.
“Recent studies, extremely well documented, all point in the same direction: the unemployment rate in Quebec is twice as high among immigrants. Access to integration services varies from place to place, and francization measures are not sufficiently funded; However, knowledge of the French language is the keystone of a successful integration in Quebec. The situation is worrying and should lead the Prime Minister to be realistic in planning the thresholds, ”declared the Member for Bourget.
“The consultations we are attending today will allow the government to decide whether or not to increase the immigration thresholds. On the other hand, the government did not ask the fundamental question: considering the limited sums it has itself chosen to devote to welcoming newcomers, how many immigrants can we reasonably hope to integrate and Frenchise successfully? every year in Quebec? Added the spokesperson.
“Some, in their obsession with massive immigration, are more concerned with the weight of Quebec within Canada than with the successful integration of immigrants. We believe, however, that we must act intelligently; if we have to stabilize the threshold at its current level or lower it, it is because the Quebec government is not investing enough or well enough in integration and francization, ”concluded Maka Kotto.
