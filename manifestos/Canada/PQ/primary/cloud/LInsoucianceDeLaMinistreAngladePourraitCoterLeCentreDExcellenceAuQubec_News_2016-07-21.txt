Québec, July 21, 2016 - The member for Sanguinet and the Parti Québécois spokesperson for the economy, Alain Therrien, doubts that the C Series center of excellence will see the light of day. According to him, the botched management of this file by Dominique Anglade and Jacques Daoust endangers the very existence of the future center.
“We were amazed to learn that Minister Anglade approves Air Canada&#39;s decision to perform engine maintenance on its C Series aircraft in the United States. However, last February, Air Canada made a commitment to do maintenance in Quebec. However, each new information indicates to us that the guarantees obtained by the government, in exchange for the investment of one billion US dollars in Bombardier and the abandonment of the remedies for the workers of Aveos, are insignificant, exposed the deputy. by Sanguinet.
“Already, in the absence of the membership of several Bombardier customers in the center of excellence, many experts doubt that this project will be carried out. It should also be remembered that by abandoning Aveos, Air Canada closed a center that maintained engines. Why then does the government allow the company to avoid this constraint with the future center of excellence? The fact that the engines were not included in the agreement with Air Canada proves that it was poorly put together. Once again, the Minister confirms her amateurism by welcoming a major flaw in her own agreement which will allow Air Canada to have the engines of its aircraft maintained outside of Quebec when it is a matter of the one of the most profitable activities, ”concluded Alain Therrien.
