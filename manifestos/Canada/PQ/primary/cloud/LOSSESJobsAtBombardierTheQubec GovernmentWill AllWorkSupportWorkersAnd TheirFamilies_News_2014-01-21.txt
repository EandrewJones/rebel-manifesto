Quebec - The Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau, reacted to the announcement of the cut by Bombardier of 1,100 jobs at its facilities in Montreal and Mirabel by first addressing the workers affected and to their families: “I want to assure you that our government will do everything in its power to help you and support you in the future. Quebec&#39;s aeronautics sector is solid and will offer job opportunities in the future. &quot;
The Minister noted that the recent announcement of the postponement of the entry into service of the two models of the CSeries, that of the CS100 being postponed to the second half of 2015 and that of the CS300, to six months later, and the financial consequences which are linked to it explain the company&#39;s decision.
“However, we have to stay positive. CSeries aircraft are high quality products with very encouraging sales prospects. At full production speed, the manufacture of the two CSeries models will employ 3,500 people in Quebec, not to mention significant spinoffs for several suppliers. It is therefore very likely that some of the employees laid off today will be recalled, in addition to those who can be reassigned to other functions within the company ”, underlined the Minister.
The Minister concluded by recalling that employees who lose their jobs can benefit from certain programs offered by the government to support them and help them in their job search.
