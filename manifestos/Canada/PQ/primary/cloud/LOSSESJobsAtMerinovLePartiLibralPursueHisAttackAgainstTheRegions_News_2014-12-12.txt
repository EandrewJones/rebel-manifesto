Quebec - The member for Berthier and official opposition critic for agriculture, fisheries and food, André Villeneuve, the member for Gaspé, Gaétan Lelièvre, and the member for Bonaventure, Sylvain Roy, denounce the Liberal government cuts, which force the Merinov Aquaculture and Fisheries Innovation Center to lay off 50 employees.
Indeed, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has still not paid the $ 800,000 necessary for the operation of Merinov. However, the expertise of this center is essential for the survival of fisheries and aquaculture in Quebec.
“The abandonment of Merinov by the government will have direct consequences on the fishing industry, a key economic sector for the regions of Gaspésie – Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Bas-Saint-Laurent and Côte -North. Fifty researchers and technicians will be unemployed on February 6 if the government does not back down. In short, Minister Pierre Paradis must immediately release the necessary funds to prevent these workers from losing their jobs, ”declared André Villeneuve.
This new episode confirms the thesis that the Liberal government has completely abandoned the regions of Quebec. “With this new cut, the Liberals are continuing their series of direct attacks on the regions. These 50 lost jobs are in addition to the hundreds of others that will result from measures such as the abolition of CRÉs, CLDs, or the change in mission of carrefours jeunesse-emploi. The government must stop attacking the regions! », Continued Gaétan Lelièvre.
As recently as last week, regional minister Jean D&#39;Amour nevertheless assured that the government would support Merinov. “Jean D&#39;Amour deceived the population by promising financial support from the government. We can see it today: the money is not there. There are limits to making big declarations, when we do not deliver the goods! ”Sylvain Roy concluded.
