Quebec– The MP for Bonaventure and official opposition spokesperson for forests, Sylvain Roy, is asking the government to renew the Forest Job Creation Program (PCEF).
&quot;The $ 15 million PCEF envelope made it possible to create 845 forest management jobs during 2012-2013, the majority of which in Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspésie – Îles-de-la-Madeleine , regions which have been hard hit by the forestry crisis, ”said Sylvain Roy.
“This program is essential for the survival of many communities where often one of the only employers is a forestry group or a cooperative. This program finances, in certain cases, more than 50% of the turnover, ”added the member for Bonaventure.
It should be remembered that the Parti Québécois government defended forestry workers and the future of the sector by holding the Rendez-vous national de la forêt québécoise, an unprecedented gathering of players in the forestry world. He also presented the Wood Charter in order to promote the use of this material in the construction industry.
“The Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, Laurent Lessard, must stand up to liberal austerity and release the funds necessary for the renewal of the PCEF. Forestry cooperatives need this funding to create the jobs workers in the regions expect, ”Sylvain Roy concluded.
