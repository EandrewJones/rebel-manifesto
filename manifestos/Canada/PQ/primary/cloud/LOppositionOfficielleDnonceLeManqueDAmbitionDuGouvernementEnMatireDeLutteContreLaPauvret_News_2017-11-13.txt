Québec, November 13, 2017 - The official opposition spokesperson for employment, social solidarity and the fight against poverty, Harold LeBel, strongly criticizes certain recommendations of the report unveiled today by the Committee of guaranteed minimum income experts.
IN SHORT
&quot;It must be said: the Measure of the consumption basket is in a way the famous&quot; poverty line &quot;. However, to have only 55% of the MPC, as the report recommends, is to get out of extreme poverty, but to remain poor. Currently, social assistance provides everyone with 52% of the MBM. A 3% increase is only $ 40 more per month. The government must do better and ensure that all Quebecers have access to a decent income, which allows them to really get out of poverty, ”claimed Harold LeBel.
“Looks like the government gave the committee a mandate that was going to provide it with the recommendations it needed. In fact, since the mandate was not specifically focused on improving income support - it was more geared towards simplifying the system and encouraging people to work - the committee could hardly recommend a substantial increase in assistance benefits. . Was the government really looking for a way to help the most vulnerable, or rather to justify the indefensible Objectif emploi program, presented this summer? Asked the spokesperson.
“Quebec currently has 800,000 people living in extreme poverty. If the government implements the report&#39;s recommendations in its next poverty reduction plan, only 100,000 will be able to get out. A rich state like Quebec cannot tolerate this state of affairs! I ask Minister François Blais to show courage and not be satisfied with the status quo. To achieve results that will really help our fellow citizens, ambition and a solid plan are necessary, ”he concluded.
