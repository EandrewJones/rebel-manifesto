Quebec - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for housing, Carole Poirier, is delighted with the decision of the City of Montreal to honor its commitments in terms of granting subsidies for access to property. At the same time, in a letter sent to the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Pierre Moreau, she urges him to follow suit and review the budget envelope provided for in the Rénovation Québec (PRQ) program. of the Société d&#39;habitation du Québec.
“Buyers whose deed had been notarized before July 14, and who had not yet submitted their reimbursement request to the City of Montreal, were unfairly deprived of an amount that they had however budgeted for. The City of Montreal made the right decision: to compensate these citizens and honor its portion of the subsidy payment. The minister must review his and do the same, ”said the spokesperson.
Remember that in its June 2014 budget, the Liberal government made the wrong decision to stop contributing to the PRQ, retroactively to the start of the current budget year. The PRQ, in effect since 2002, made it possible to subsidize municipalities to develop major home ownership and home renovation assistance programs, funded 50% by the government and 50% by towns. Montreal, like several other cities, benefited from the PRQ, which enabled it to set up six programs, including one to facilitate access to homeownership.
“This measure mainly benefited families; it is not fair that they have to pay for a government decision, the details of which were suddenly communicated to the cities, not allowing them to adjust their budgets, ”concluded the deputy.
