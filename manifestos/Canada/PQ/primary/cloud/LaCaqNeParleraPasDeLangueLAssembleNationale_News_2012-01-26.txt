Joliette - &quot;Contrary to what he said, the French language is not an issue for François Legault&quot;. This is what the member for Drummond and official opposition spokesperson for language, Yves-François Blanchet, said, noting that the CAQ leader, François Legault, did not see fit to name a door. -speaking on the French language in his shadow cabinet unveiled today.
“It&#39;s still revealing. After swearing his attachment to the French language, François Legault misses his shot at the first opportunity. The observation is clear: he does not share the interest and concern of the vast majority of Quebecers for the French language. By not designating any person in charge specific to linguistic questions, François Legault is doing like Jean Charest and placing the issue of language very far in his priorities, ”declared Yves-François Blanchet.
According to the member for Drummond, this “oversight” in such a critical issue is an example of the improvisation that led to the meager political program of the Coalition Avenir Québec. “It&#39;s no wonder. Unlike all recognized parties, the CAQ does without the exercise of reflection and democracy for the development of a program by hundreds or thousands of militants. There are big holes in this party under the authority of one self-proclaimed messiah. After the environment and agriculture, two issues absent from the CAQ program, it is today the language that the CAQ allows itself to neglect, ”he concluded.
