Québec, October 24, 2014 - The MNA for Bourget and official opposition spokesperson for immigration, Maka Kotto, and the MNA for Gaspé and spokesperson for regional development, Gaétan Lelièvre, denounce the allows the Liberal government to continue its work of centralization. He announced the closure of the regional offices of the Ministry of Immigration, Diversity and Inclusion (MIDI) located in Quebec, Trois-Rivières, Gatineau and Sherbrooke.
&quot;How can we ensure optimal integration of immigrants in our regions when the resources devoted to them are cut?&quot; This real dismantling breaks the link between the department, the communities and the organizations. We cannot claim that there will be no impact on services. The integration of newcomers to Quebec, Trois-Rivières, Sherbrooke and Gatineau is just as essential as it is in Montreal, ”said Maka Kotto.
The member for Gaspé, for his part, indicates that the regions are once again losing the tools and resources necessary for their development. This drop in local services comes on top of many other examples of liberal cuts affecting the regions of Quebec.
In addition, what will happen to the amounts resulting from specific regional immigration agreements? Resources were in fact allocated to regional organizations, in particular the CRÉs, CLDs and MRCs. At the rate at which the liberal cuts are going, the Parti Québécois is wondering if there will be any organizations left to receive these sums.
“The Liberals continue in the same logic; they claim to know better than the people on the ground what to do. They build themselves an ivory tower, from which citizens are excluded. Centralization and state control, operations carried out under the mask of austerity, hurt the development of regions, not only economically, but also socially. This loss of public service expertise, a reality that affects several areas, will certainly not help the integration of newcomers in our regions, ”added Gaétan Lelièvre.
