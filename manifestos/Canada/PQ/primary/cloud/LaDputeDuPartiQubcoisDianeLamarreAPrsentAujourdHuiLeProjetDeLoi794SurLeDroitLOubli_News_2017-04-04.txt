Quebec - April being Cancer Awareness Month, Parti Québécois spokesperson for health, access to care and home support, Diane Lamarre, today presented a bill that tackles discrimination often affecting cancer survivors, the Law governing the use of state of health as a factor in determining risk in insurance contracts.
IN SHORT
The Parti Québécois today introduced a bill affecting cancer survivors.
“We believe in the right to be forgotten. We believe that insurers should be prohibited from imposing an additional premium or outright refusing an individual insurance contract to a person who has survived cancer, after a specific period of time. For survivors of certain common types of cancer, the timeframe for access to the right to be forgotten could vary between 1 and 10 years after the end of treatment, depending on scientific data. The Parti Québécois wants to ensure that people are no longer discriminated against when the risk of cancer recurrence is zero or extremely low, ”explained Diane Lamarre.
“Nearly one in two Quebecers will suffer from some form of cancer during their lifetime. Fortunately, more than 60% will survive it beyond 5 years. To prevent these people from becoming double victims of this terrible disease, by preventing this form of discrimination against them, is the least of things. We hope that the Minister of Health will be sensitive to this issue and that he will support the bill, ”concluded the spokesperson.
In the appendix, you will find the explanatory notes concerning Bill 794.
