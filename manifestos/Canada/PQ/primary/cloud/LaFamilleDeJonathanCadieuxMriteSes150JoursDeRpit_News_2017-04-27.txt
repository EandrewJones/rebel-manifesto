Quebec, April 27, 2017– Dave Turcotte, Parti Québécois spokesperson for social services and youth protection, this morning filed a petition of 6,725 names asking the Quebec government to restore services to families Cadieux so that she can keep Jonathan, a child with severe disabilities, at home. More specifically, the petitioners are calling for the family to be given back the 150 days per year of specialized respite services it previously had, and for its fuel to be reimbursed.
IN SHORT
“Until November 2016, Jonathan&#39;s parents kept their son at home; considering the cumbersome nature of his care, they were entitled to 150 days per year of specialized respite services offered by the Sud-Ouest rehabilitation and reinforcement services. However, after a reorganization, the number of days of respite rose to 48, at a cost of $ 30 per day, like other families of disabled children. This is far from sufficient, all the more so if we consider the significant costs that this situation causes, the parents having decided to leave their job, ”revealed Dave Turcotte.
Despite their best efforts, they still had to resolve to place Jonathan in an institution. “His handicap is too heavy, it&#39;s too much to ask of this family. But, on the other hand, living in an institution is not the solution; Jonathan could wither away, deprived of his parents&#39; presence, care and love. We must support the Cadieux family so that Jonathan can receive the help he needs to stay at home, ”continued the spokesperson.
Jonathan&#39;s example is terribly sad and, sadly, it is not unique. “The cuts made by Minister Gaétan Barrette in health and social services are hurting families and the most disadvantaged throughout Quebec. In the name of human dignity, the government must restore the services offered to the Cadieux family; she deserves her 150 days of respite per year, ”concluded Dave Turcotte.
