Quebec - The Minister of Labor, Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Minister responsible for the Capitale-Nationale and Chaudière-Appalaches regions and Minister responsible for the Régie des rentes du Québec , Ms. Agnès Maltais, this morning tabled the bill allowing the establishment of target benefit pension plans in certain companies in the pulp and paper sector.
In doing so, Ms. Maltais is respecting her commitment to proceed quickly in order to allow the implementation of the legal framework that will make possible the creation of new pension plans, in particular at Papiers White Birch. “This is an essential first step, but there is still work to be done. The union and the employer must always agree on certain provisions of the text of the new plans and, more importantly, the company must pay the promised money ”, recalled Ms. Maltais.
The Minister is counting on the collaboration of the members of the National Assembly to have the bill adopted before the end of this session and welcomes the commitments already made in this regard.
