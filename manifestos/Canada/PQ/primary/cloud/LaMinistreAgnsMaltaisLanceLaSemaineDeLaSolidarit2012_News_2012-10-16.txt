Quebec - Ms. Agnès Maltais, Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women is pleased to launch the third edition of Solidarity Week, which takes place this year from 14 to 20 October.
On this occasion, the Minister invites all partners and organizations to join local and regional initiatives to fight poverty, in particular those proposed by regional conferences of elected officials.
“I take this opportunity to thank those who get involved all year round in this daily fight. I am proud that this thematic week can be used to mobilize our forces to help people in need. We must never abdicate in the face of poverty, but look it in the face and push it back. We must build an ever fairer Quebec for everyone, ”recalls the Minister.
Note that this week revolves around the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, which takes place every year on October 17 across the world.
&quot;Mobilization increases individual strengths tenfold and makes everyone&#39;s efforts more effective,&quot; concludes Minister Maltais.
