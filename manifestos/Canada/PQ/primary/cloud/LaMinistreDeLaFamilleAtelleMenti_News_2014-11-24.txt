Quebec - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, asks for explanations from the Minister of Families, Francine Charbonneau, who would have completely ignored a request from the Status Council de la femme (CSF) to carry out a gender-based analysis of the impact of the government&#39;s ideological decision to modulate the tariffs of childcare services on the presence of women in the labor market.
“On October 6, the CSF invited the government to carry out this differentiated analysis. Why did the minister refuse to act on this suggestion? Why did you mention last Friday that she did not have the reflex to ask the CSF for its opinion and that that was a mistake? Is it because she had not carried out this analysis that she now says that the family tax is only a proposal? Either the minister lied, or she knowingly ignored the CSF letter and chose not to perform a gender analysis. It is a serious fault for which it owes explanations to Quebecers ”, declared Carole Poirier.
As her colleague, Member of Parliament for Taschereau and Parliamentary Leader of the Official Opposition, Agnès Maltais, did last Friday, the Member formally asked the Minister to carry out a gender-based analysis, an analysis which, to date, has not has not yet been completed.
“In Quebec, we decided to set up a system that gives women a choice, allowing them to return to the labor market. The modulation of the tariffs makes us go back in time. Like the CSF, we believe in the benefits of the childcare network in terms of the presence of women in the labor market and the reconciliation of family, work and study, ”concluded Carole Poirier.
