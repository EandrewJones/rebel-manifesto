Quebec - The member for Terrebonne and official opposition critic for family matters, Mathieu Traversy, is surprised to learn that the daycare where a sexual assault on a 4-year-old girl allegedly occurred remains open pending the investigation procedures. The Minister of the Family, Francine Charbonneau, had however affirmed, last May 12, that the day care service was going to close its doors.
“The coordinating office has not closed the home childcare service, while an internal investigation is taking place. Why? The minister must provide answers to the many questions; transparency is essential. Parents&#39; trust in childcare services in Quebec is at stake. We have a wonderful system of child care, and parents need to be able to safely leave their children there. The rules and the framework must be reviewed with the network and those responsible for home childcare services, in order to better support them, ”said Mathieu Traversy.
“Currently, the Minister is making parents pay more by imposing the family tax, delaying the development of spaces, cutting childcare budgets and not improving quality, accessibility or safety. It must immediately revoke the license for this daycare and relocate the children, while the internal investigation takes its course and that light is shed on the circumstances of this dramatic event, ”concluded Mathieu Traversy.
