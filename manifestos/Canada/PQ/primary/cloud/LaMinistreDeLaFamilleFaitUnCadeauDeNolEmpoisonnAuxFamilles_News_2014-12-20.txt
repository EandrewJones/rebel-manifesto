Quebec - The member for Terrebonne and official opposition critic for family matters, Mathieu Traversy, denounces the contemptuous attitude of the Minister of Families, Francine Charbonneau, who announced this afternoon, just before the Christmas holidays, changes in the funding of projects to create childcare places. The changes, effective today, will require childcare centers to provide 50% of the funding for capital costs.
“By demanding such a contribution, the minister is slashing the network and she knows it very well. No place in a childcare center can be created. This is the final touch to the 2014 Liberal attacks on families. Parents who are waiting for a place and children from disadvantaged backgrounds are once again targeted by the Minister. As Christmas approaches, it&#39;s the worst gift she could give to parents and children in Quebec, ”said Mathieu Traversy.
“Like one of her liberal predecessors, Tony Tomassi, the Minister for the Family displays an obvious contempt for the network of childcare centers. The changes made today are aimed directly at it, for the benefit of non-subsidized private daycare centers. That the minister stop lying to families by saying that places continue to be created in the network, when she knows that childcare centers will no longer be able to do so. Since taking office, she has only demonstrated, day after day, that families are the least of her worries. It must give up its place, ”concluded Mathieu Traversy.
