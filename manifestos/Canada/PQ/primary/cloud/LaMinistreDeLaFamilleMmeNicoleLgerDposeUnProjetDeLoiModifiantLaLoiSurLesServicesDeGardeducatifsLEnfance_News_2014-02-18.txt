Quebec - The Minister of Families, Ms. Nicole Léger, today presented to the National Assembly a bill amending the Act respecting educational childcare services. The proposed legislative changes follow the judgment handed down by the Court of Appeal in September 2013 concerning the number of daycare licenses and places with subsidized daycare that a person or persons related to them may hold.
“The Ministère de la Famille is continuing its efforts and taking the necessary measures to limit the concentration of daycare centers while following up the decision of the Court of Appeal. With this bill, we are maintaining the objective of not exceeding the limits of 5 licenses / 300 places, ”said Minister Nicole Léger.
The proposed legislative changes will make it possible to circumscribe the notion of related person by limiting to certain situations the cases in which a natural person or a legal person would be considered related with another person for the purposes of the Act. Indeed, the bill provides that a related person who establishes the absence of an economic tie is not related within the meaning of sections 93.1 and 93.2 of the Act. Also, there may be economic ties similar to those found within a family between people who are not related; legislative changes also cover these situations. The bill also provides for the possibility for the Ministry of the Family to require any document or information necessary to verify whether people are economically linked.
The provisions of subparagraph 2 a) of section 3 of the Educational Childcare Act, as currently drafted, remain in force until September 11, 2014, i.e. until the expiration of the one-year suspension of the decision of the Court of Appeal, or until the entry into force of the new proposed provisions, if this occurs before that date. When the new provisions of the Act come into force, the Ministère de la Famille will inform the network of subsidized daycare centers.
