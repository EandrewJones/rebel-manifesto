Quebec - Quebec&#39;s Minister of Natural Resources, Martine Ouellet, tabled a draft mining law this morning to provide Quebec with modern mining legislation. This adjusted bill will ensure the development of the Quebec mining industry while respecting the environment.
“We have heard the comments of citizens and the various stakeholders in the field, as well as those of opposition members, and we have managed to strike a balance. If it is diligently adopted by the National Assembly, this balanced bill will put an end to a four-year process and will allow us collectively to meet the next challenges we face, ”said Martine Ouellet.
Among others, the bill:
“The balance is there. The substance is there. The consensus is there. Quebecers are ripe for a new mining law. Now is the time for Parliament to act and open a new era for responsible, dynamic and balanced mining development in Quebec, ”concluded the Minister of Natural Resources.
