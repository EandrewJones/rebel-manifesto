Quebec - It is with sadness and concern that we learned yesterday that the Cinéma Excentris, grappling with major financial difficulties, must suspend its activities. The Parti Québécois spokesperson for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, asks the Minister of Culture, Hélène David, to find solutions that will ensure the survival of the institution.
“The Excentris, specializing in auteur cinema, is an exceptional window for Quebec films and filmmakers. It also facilitates the distribution of independent films from here and elsewhere. Its definitive closure would be a huge loss for Quebec&#39;s cultural community, ”said the member for Joliette.
Véronique Hivon underlines the paradox of the current situation. &quot;The Excentris is closing its doors, while distributors say they lack theaters and repertory or emerging cinema is struggling to find venues,&quot; she said.
&quot;On behalf of Quebec film buffs, the influence of the seventh art and without forgetting the employees of the Excentris, for whom we have a special thought, we ask Minister Hélène David to find concrete solutions that will ensure the survival of the &#39;establishment,&#39; concluded Véronique Hivon.
