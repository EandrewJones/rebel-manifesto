Quebec– The member for Bertrand and official opposition spokesperson for tourism, Claude Cousineau, demands that the Minister of Tourism, Dominique Vien, renounce imposing the tax on lodging for camping.
“Faithful to the liberal tradition, Philippe Couillard promised tax cuts during the election campaign, but he governs by increasing them. It seems that when they get up in the morning, members of the government always have a new idea of a tax to impose on Quebeckers. The majority of the campers are locals, they are not an international clientele; the government must give up the idea of taxing them, ”said Claude Cousineau.
The member believes that when the Liberal government talks about taxes, we should always be wary. For example, during the study of the budget appropriations, Minister Vien clearly said that the tax on lodging did not belong to the regional tourist associations (ATR), and that her government would &quot;need to sums of money ”. What do these cryptic words mean? Claude Cousineau therefore asks the Minister to reiterate her confidence in ATRs and to commit to seeking solutions other than standardizing the tax on lodging or a tax on camping.
No to the standardization of the tax on lodging
&quot;Even the former Liberal Minister Raymond Bachand, who has himself increased taxes, tariffs and taxes by $ 6 billion, warns the government against centralizing the tax on lodging, believing that this would penalize greatly the ATRs. What does the minister intend to do? It is essential that the regions, already undermined by liberal austerity policies, can retain the management of the tax on accommodation and the freedom to decide how to reinvest it, according to their specific characteristics ”, he added. concluded the member for Bertrand.
