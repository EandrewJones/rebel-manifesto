Quebec - The Minister for Native Affairs, Mrs. Élizabeth Larouche, will take part in the canonization of Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha on October 21 in Rome. Ms. Larouche will represent the Government of Quebec at this unique event, during which the first Native American saint will be consecrated.
Ms. Larouche said she was honored to take part in this event: “Kateri Tekakwitha remains a symbol for Quebec, especially for the aboriginal nations. I am very proud to represent my government at this historic moment. &quot;
Ms. Larouche will speak at the reception organized by the Quebec delegation, which will take place on Monday, October 22. It will also be an opportunity for her to interact with representatives of indigenous communities and foreign dignitaries.
Born in the United States, Kateri Tekakwitha (1656-1680) lived part of her life in New France. His tomb is on display in the town of Sainte-Catherine, near Kahnawake. &quot;It embodies both the cultural heritage of the First Nations who populated Quebec and our Catholic tradition,&quot; added the Minister.
Ms. Élizabeth Larouche was appointed Minister responsible for Native Affairs on September 19, 2012. She was given the mandate to support the Native Nations of Quebec in their economic, social and cultural development and to ensure that relations between Quebec and the indigenous peoples rise to the nation-to-nation level.
