Quebec - The Minister for Social Services and Youth Protection, Ms. Véronique Hivon, has announced that Quebecers who wish to adopt Haitian children will once again be able to submit their request through two organizations approved by the Ministry of Health and Social Services of Quebec, that is, Corporation welcome un enfant and Soleil des nations.
“This is great news for Haitian children. They can be accommodated permanently by Quebec parents with whom they can grow and flourish. It should be noted that the adoption procedures gradually resumed in the spring of 2013, in particular in order to experiment with the new Haitian adoption procedures. I am happy to announce today the full resumption of activities, ”said Ms. Hivon.
Recall that Quebec had suspended its adoption procedures with Haiti following the earthquake of 2010, due to certain uncertainties regarding the control of the adoption process in this country. Quebec then encouraged the creation of a coalition of host countries, the Montreal Group, bringing together Canada, France, the United States and Germany, among others, and whose goal is to support Haiti in the establishment of an adequate legislative and administrative framework.
“This is a great example of international collaboration. This shows that we are all committed to respecting the fundamental rights of children and ensuring that the adoption process takes place in their best interests in the first place. I would also like to salute the work accomplished by the Haitian authorities to reform international adoption as well as their collaboration with the coalition of the main host countries for children of Haiti, ”added Minister Hivon.
