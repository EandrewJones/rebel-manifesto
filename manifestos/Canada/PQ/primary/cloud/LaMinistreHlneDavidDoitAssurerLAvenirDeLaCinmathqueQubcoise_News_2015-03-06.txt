Quebec - While voices from the film industry are speaking out against a possible merger of the Cinémathèque québécoise with Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec, the member for Joliette and official opposition spokesperson for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, asks Minister Hélène David to be clear and to ensure the future of the Cinémathèque, a real jewel of our cultural heritage.
“During the episode of the regional conservatories, the minister&#39;s closure plans indicated a serious lack of vision and a great deal of improvisation. Today we seem to want to play in the same film, this time with the Cinémathèque, an important institution for the preservation and enhancement of our audiovisual heritage. Unfortunately, it is currently in jeopardy. Several players in this field are however concerned, with good reason, about the possible merger of two institutions with very different missions, fearing that the Cinémathèque will be completely swallowed up in the operation, ”declared Véronique Hivon.
“Minister Hélène David must put an end to the uncertainty now and be clear in her intentions. Will she force the merger? What would be the reasons? For more than 50 years, the Cinémathèque has been building its expertise; today it is an internationally recognized institution. I invite the minister to dialogue and collaboration; it must not impose an unfounded and dangerous decision for the maintenance of the excellence of the Cinémathèque, ”concluded the Member for Joliette.
