Québec– The member for Joliette and official opposition critic for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, this morning asked Minister Hélène David to reassure the cultural community about the idea that is circulating to persistent manner to the effect that we would proceed to the closure of conservatories in the region. The minister not only refused to rule out this scenario, but she also increased the level of concern by invoking the legal existence of &quot;a single conservatory&quot; with simple &quot;regional poles&quot;, seeming to consider them as institutions. second-rate.
“Conservatories are institutions which, in addition to training high-level artists, are real catalysts for cultural life in the region. By allowing music professionals to settle and improve their skills outside of Montreal and Quebec, we animate the communities of Bas-Saint-Laurent, Saguenay – Lac-Saint-Jean, Outaouais, Mauricie and Abitibi-Témiscamingue. All these regions benefit greatly from the impact and influence of conservatories, ”said Véronique Hivon.
Since the birth of the first conservatory in 1942, these institutions have trained hundreds of professional artists who now work as members of regional orchestras, but also as teachers and cultural animators. These professionals, as well as their students, are also at the heart of cultural projects and the programming of performance venues that promote culture in their region and throughout Quebec.
“After having cut in tax credits for cultural production, undermined national museums and devalued the importance of reading and books, the Liberal government knowingly casts doubt on the maintenance of conservatories. What is the Minister of Culture and Communications waiting for to fully assume her role and confirm the importance of the recruitment and teaching mission of conservatoires? What is she waiting for to fight to protect Quebec&#39;s cultural development? ”, Concluded the member for Joliette.
