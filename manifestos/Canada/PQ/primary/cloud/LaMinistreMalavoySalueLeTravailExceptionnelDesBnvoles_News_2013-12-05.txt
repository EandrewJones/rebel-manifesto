Quebec - On this International Volunteer Day, the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports, Ms. Marie Malavoy, would like to warmly thank the thousands of Quebecers who contribute, each year, to offering their fellow citizens a vast range of services and activities in the fields of leisure and sport, but also in the support they provide to the education network.
“Quebec is fortunate to be able to count on the participation of more than half a million volunteers in recreation, sport and education. These people generously offer their expertise and their time, making it possible to hold a multitude of activities in their community. They contribute to the development of a feeling of belonging which binds the bonds between Quebeckers and promotes solidarity. Volunteering is an essential asset for our society, ”said Minister Malavoy.
Remember that the Ministère de l&#39;Éducation, du Loisir et du Sport recently honored 24 laureates as part of the Dollard-Morin recreational and sports volunteer award. These exceptional volunteers have succeeded in making their community shine through their actions. They are a fine example of altruism and bear witness to the ripple effect that self-giving can generate.
In 1985, the United Nations General Assembly declared the International Day of Volunteers (IBD) on December 5 to pay tribute annually to the commitment of those around the world who contribute to the well-being of their fellow citizens. . Thus, many organizations and businesses are now taking advantage of this day to highlight the work of their volunteers and the value of their commitment.
