Quebec - The Minister of Natural Resources, Martine Ouellet, is proud to announce the award of two mining leases to the mining company XStrata for its Bracemac-McLeod project, whose zinc and copper extraction activities will begin at the mid-May, in the Matagami region.
“The opening of this mine means at least 250 direct jobs over a period of at least four years. The opening of the Bracemac-McLeod mine is excellent news for a city of 2,000 inhabitants like Matagami, ”said Martine Ouellet. The opening of the mine will allow, among other things, the transfer of the expertise of the employees of the Persévérance mine, another XStrata property in the region, whose operation is nearing its end.
“This news is very important for the city of Matagami, its workers and our region. This demonstrates our government&#39;s desire to focus on northern development, ”said Luc Ferland, Member of Parliament for Ungava and Parliamentary Assistant for Nordic Affairs.
The exploitation of zinc and copper from the Bracemac-McLeod deposits also ensures the supply of the Matagami plant, which produces a concentrate for each of the metals. The zinc concentrate will then be transformed at the CEZinc plant in Valleyfield, and that of copper will be transformed at the Horne smelter in Rouyn-Noranda and at the CCR refinery in Montreal, which allows the maintenance of more than 1,800 jobs.
XStrata&#39;s initial investment is $ 160 million to which will be added $ 70-75 million per year of operation.
“Here we have a fine example of the economic spinoffs that can be generated by the mining industry when processing in Quebec is encouraged. This is exactly the kind of structuring economic project that Quebec needs, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
