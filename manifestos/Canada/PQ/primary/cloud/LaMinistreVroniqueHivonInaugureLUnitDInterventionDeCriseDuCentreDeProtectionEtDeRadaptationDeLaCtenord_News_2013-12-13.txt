Sept-Îles - The Minister for Social Services and Youth Protection, Ms. Véronique Hivon, today inaugurated the new crisis intervention unit of the Center de protection et de réadaptation de la Côte-Nord (CPRCN) . For the occasion, the Minister was accompanied by the Member of Parliament for Duplessis, Ms. Lorraine Richard.
This new crisis intervention unit, annexed to the rehabilitation center, will be able to accommodate young people in difficulty aged 6 to 18 years. They will now have access to a place where they can temporarily withdraw during crisis situations. This project is the result of a collaboration initiated by the CPRCN to provide an additional tool for all stakeholders working with young people and families.
“I salute the efforts made by the CPRCN team to provide better support to young people in difficulty and their families, with the aim of providing them with services adapted to their needs and their specific situations. This new unit will allow young people who often have to deal with larger-than-life challenges to benefit from a quiet place to retreat when they are going through a difficult situation. They will now be able to receive the required support more quickly, while remaining closer to their home, ”said Ms. Hivon.
“I am delighted for these young people who, thanks to the cooperation of people in the field, will benefit from greater security and will be better supported in the difficult ordeals they are going through. They will no longer have to travel outside their community to receive the precious help they need, which is excellent news for young people in Septiliens and their families who are experiencing difficulties, ”added the member for Duplessis.
Built at a total cost of $ 2,313,212, this new unit, which will open its doors in early 2014, will have a recurring annual operating budget of $ 738,716 from the Agence de la santé et des services sociaux de the North Shore and the CPRCN.
