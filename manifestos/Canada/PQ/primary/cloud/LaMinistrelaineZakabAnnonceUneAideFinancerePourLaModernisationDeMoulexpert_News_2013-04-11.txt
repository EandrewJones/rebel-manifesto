Lévis - The Minister for Industrial Policy and the Quebec Economic Development Bank, Ms. Élaine Zakaïb, is pleased to mark the inauguration of the new Moulexpert inc. The company received a financial contribution of $ 150,000 for its modernization project, which aims to increase its competitiveness.
Moulexpert designs and manufactures injection molds for the plastic and aluminum sectors. The modernization project, which totaled an investment of over $ 750,000, included the acquisition of a very high performance five-axis machining center and the complete redevelopment of the plant&#39;s functional spaces. Moulexpert thus wishes to improve its productivity and gradually increase its market share, in particular with customers in the thin-walled packaging sector.
“The competitiveness of our companies requires increased productivity, which essentially involves innovation and the modernization of their equipment. The Moulexpert project, a leader in the design and manufacture of injection molds, will ensure the growth of its activities, and this is why we are happy to give it our support, ”explained Élaine Zakaïb. “This intervention allows the company to consolidate all 20 existing jobs, which is excellent news for the economic development of the Chaudière-Appalaches region. &quot;
&quot;The financial support from the Government of Quebec, granted through the Essor program of Investissement Québec, will allow us to be more productive and to offer products to our clients in a shorter timeframe,&quot; said Mr. Steve Nadeau, General Manager of Moulexpert. “With a more efficient factory, Moulexpert is giving itself the means to achieve its ambitions. Thanks to recent modernization work, we expect to increase the company&#39;s turnover by 25% annually. &quot;
