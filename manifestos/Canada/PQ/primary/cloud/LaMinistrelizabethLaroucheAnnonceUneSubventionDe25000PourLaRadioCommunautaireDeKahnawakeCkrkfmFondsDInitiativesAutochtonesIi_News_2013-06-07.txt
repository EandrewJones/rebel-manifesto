Quebec - The Minister for Native Affairs, Ms. Élizabeth Larouche, announces a grant of $ 26,522 to CKRK-FM, a community non-profit organization.
“As a privileged mode of communication, this radio station has been part of the daily life of the Mohawk Nation for over 30 years. It has become, in a way, an institution. Its vocation, both cultural and informative, makes it an essential service to the population, and listeners are particularly attached to it, ”said the Minister.
This grant will mainly be used to purchase technical equipment, made necessary since the organization had to leave its old premises due to their obsolescence, to move into a new building in 2011. This building also houses a training center in Mohawk language and culture. This new workspace is now safe and healthy for employees.
The financial assistance granted to the CKRK-FM radio station in Kahnawake comes from the Native Initiatives Fund II of the Secrétariat aux affaires autochtones (SAA), community infrastructure component. The objective of this fund is to support projects that could have significant spinoffs on the economic, social or community development of the Aboriginal nations of Quebec.
