Odanak - The Minister for Native Affairs, Ms. Élizabeth Larouche, today visited the Abenaki community of Odanak on the occasion of a visit to the Kiuna Institution, the first post-secondary school made by and for the First Nations of Quebec.
“It is very stimulating for me to meet the students of the Kiuna Institution, as well as the people who work there. The Aboriginals of Quebec want a bright future for their young people, and education is one of the keys to offering them this opportunity, ”said Ms. Larouche.
The Minister was able to benefit from a site visit, after which she expressed her enthusiasm: “The facilities of the Kiuna Institution are magnificent! I am very happy that young Aboriginals can attend a school of this quality ”.
Ms. Larouche then had dinner and discussed with the students, accompanied by the regional chief of the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec and Labrador, Mr. Ghislain Picard. She also met the Grand Chief of the Abenakis of Odanak, Mr. Richard O&#39;Bomsawin.
Inaugurated two years ago, the Kiuna Institution, administered by the First Nations Education Council (FNEC), provides Indigenous students with quality education in an environment that showcases First Nations culture and traditions, enhancing thus access to post-secondary studies as well as the success and graduation rate of young people and adults who enroll in it.
The Government of Quebec has funded the Kiuna Institution to the tune of $ 1.07 million, of which $ 33,000 comes from the Secrétariat aux affaires autochtones (SAA).
Ms. Élizabeth Larouche also took advantage of her visit to Odanak to visit the Musée des Abénakis. Open since 1962, it is the very first Amerindian museum to open in Quebec.
