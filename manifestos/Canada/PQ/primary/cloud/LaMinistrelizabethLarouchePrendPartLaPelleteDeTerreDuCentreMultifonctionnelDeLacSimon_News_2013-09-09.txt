Quebec - The Minister for Native Affairs and Member of Parliament for Abitibi-Est, Ms. Élizabeth Larouche, was passing through the Algonquin community of Lac-Simon today to participate in the ceremony marking the official start of construction work on a new multifunctional center. This center will house the grocery and hardware store and the community hall. The new complex project will create around 20 direct jobs, including around 15 full-time.
“The multifunctional complex will diversify the economy of Lac-Simon in addition to improving its well-being. Our government is proud to support this project, which will certainly provide structuring benefits for the community, ”declared Minister Élizabeth Larouche, who was received by the leader of the Algonquin community of Lac-Simon, Ms. Salomé McKenzie.
The grocery-hardware project, funded to the tune of $ 921,950, will serve the community and the clientele of neighboring outfitters with food, hardware and non-prescription pharmaceutical products. Its corporate model will be based on the concept of the social economy. Thus, the Wabak Solidarity Cooperative will provide work to its worker members as well as goods to its user members.
An amount of $ 880,000 will be used to renew certain community infrastructures. The current community hall had become obsolete. The new center will be used to hold cultural and community activities, as well as for recreation and the holding of official meetings.
The financial assistance granted to the Conseil de la Nation Anishnabe du Lac-Simon comes from the Native Development Fund, the Native Initiatives Fund and the Native Initiatives Fund II of the Native Affairs Secretariat, in the community infrastructure components and economic development. The objective of these programs is to support projects that could have significant spinoffs on the development of Aboriginal communities in Quebec, whether on the economic, social or community level.
