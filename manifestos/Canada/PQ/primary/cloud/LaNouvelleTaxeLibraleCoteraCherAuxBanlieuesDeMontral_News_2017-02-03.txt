Quebec, February 3, 2017 - The Parti Québécois transport spokesperson, Alain Therrien, denounces the new tax that the Liberal government will impose on the suburbs of Montreal, without any form of transparency.
“We had confirmation this morning that the Couillard government has hidden a new tax for the suburbs in the Act respecting the Regional Metropolitan Transport Authority, the ARTM. In fact, only for the reform of the structure, the suburbs will have to pay an additional sum of $ 32 million, which will be added to the already planned increase in their contributions, which also amounts to several million dollars, ”he added. illustrated Alain Therrien.
“Thus, Longueuil, Laval and the other southern and northern suburbs will pay millions more, but will not benefit from any new public transport service. Worse: to these spectacular increases, we must add the costs of the annual subsidy that municipalities will ultimately have to pay for the Metropolitan Electric Network; we are talking about an additional bill of around $ 200 million, whereas the government had promised that the REM would not require any subsidy, ”continued the spokesperson.
“Finally, by creating the ARTM, the Liberal government passed on a multi-million dollar QST bill to municipalities. Ultimately, in 2020, it will amount to nearly $ 15 million. When will the Liberal government stop making municipalities pay for carrying out its election promises, the cost of which continues to rise? “Asked Alain Therrien.
