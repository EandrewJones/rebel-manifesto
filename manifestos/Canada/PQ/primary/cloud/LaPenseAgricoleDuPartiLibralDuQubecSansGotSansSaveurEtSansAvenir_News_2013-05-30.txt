Quebec - The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr. François Gendron, is shocked to learn this morning that, for the Liberal Party of Quebec (PLQ) of Mr. Philippe Couillard , the Quebec agrifood industry is tasteless, tasteless and without a future.
The MP for Huntington, official opposition spokesperson for agriculture and fisheries and president of the next election campaign for the PLQ, Mr. Stéphane Billette, took up, commented on and supported a column by Ms. Lysiane Gagnon from the daily La Presse through the social network Twitter. This column, published this morning and entitled &quot;Life without olive oil&quot;, contains crude and absolutely false claims.
Thus, according to Ms. Gagnon and Mr. Billette, canned tomatoes from Italy will always be tastier than greenhouse tomatoes from Quebec; supply management forces the consumption of tasteless poultry and eggs from Quebec; Quebec&#39;s food industry has nothing distinctive about it and contributes to the underdevelopment of the Third World, and Quebec artisan cheeses cost twice as much as a good French cheese.
“It is absurd and absolutely unacceptable. I ask Liberal leader Philippe Couillard to dissociate himself from his MP. The latter must apologize to the 475,000 people who work tirelessly every day to bring products of unparalleled quality to the market. We cannot let the deputy soil the work they do with passion, ”said François Gendron.
