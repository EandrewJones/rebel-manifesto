Montreal - A few days before Christmas, the Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, wanted to offer her best wishes to Quebeckers.
“During this holiday season, let&#39;s take this well-deserved break to find those who are dear to us. May these precious moments be synonymous with shared festivities and happiness for all!
Over the past year, Quebeckers have shown extraordinary solidarity when the community of Lac-Mégantic was hit by a rail tragedy. I think that many of us will have a thought for Méganticoises and Méganticois during this period of the year when sadness and mourning become at times heavier to bear. Likewise, let us be generous to our fellow citizens who face illness, poverty or exclusion.
Over the past year, Quebeckers have all worked hard to improve their living conditions and those of their families. This is what our government is also dedicated to. For 2014, what I wish us collectively is to continue building a richer, more united and proud Quebec, a Quebec strong in all its regions and united in its diversity. Until then, I wish everyone a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! &quot;
