Montreal - The Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, paid tribute to Mrs. Louise Laurin, committed woman and tireless activist for the causes of secularism and sovereignty. “I have had the opportunity to work with Ms. Laurin on several occasions, as part of our common commitments. She was a woman of convictions, whose career is marked by a remarkable coherence. &quot;
Pauline Marois underlined how much Ms. Laurin&#39;s battles took place at the forefront, so much so that they are still relevant today. “Making Quebec a sovereign country in which all citizens will be united by a common language and culture is still the meaning of our political action today. Long before these subjects took their rightful place in our current public space, Louise Laurin spoke to us about secularism, the integration of new Quebecers, school daycare services and the importance of developing a strong Quebec citizenship. For her, all these subjects were intimately linked. &quot;
Ms. Laurin&#39;s departure comes as the Quebec government promises to be active on each of these issues. “For a long time to come, Louise Laurin&#39;s actions will continue to produce effects. We will be inspired by his determination to carry out the projects that were dear to him. For the time being, however, our thoughts are with those close to Ms. Laurin, ”added the Premier.
Pauline Marois and the members of the Parti Québécois parliamentary wing team join forces to offer their sincere condolences to Louise Laurin&#39;s family and loved ones.
