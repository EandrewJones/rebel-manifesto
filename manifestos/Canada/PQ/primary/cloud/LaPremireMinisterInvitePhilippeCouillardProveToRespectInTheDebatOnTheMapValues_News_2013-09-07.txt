Quebec - The Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, reacted to the statements of the leader of the Liberal Party of Quebec (PLQ), Philippe Couillard, who accuses him of having made offensive remarks during an interview with the Duty, the September 5.
“I invite the leader of the PLQ to show respect in the debate on the Quebec charter of values. At the moment, he is rather trying to hijack the debate and unnecessarily start fires. Instead of raising his voice, Philippe Couillard should wait a few days before opposing a position that has not even been presented yet ”, declared the Prime Minister.
Ms Marois would like to point out that during her interview at Le Devoir, she referred to statements by British Prime Ministers Tony Blair (Labor Party) and David Cameron (Conservative Party) dating, in particular, from 2006 and 2011. &#39;she then held was in no way offensive and in no way interfered with the policies practiced in the United Kingdom.
“The discussion with the journalists of the Duty focused on the models of integration in the world. However, it is up to Quebec to develop its own model, according to its values and its history. Instead of trying to sow discord, the leader of the Liberal Party should concentrate on coming to present his positions to the National Assembly and stop giving lessons outside the parliamentary arena, ”concluded Ms. Marois.
Remember that in August, Pauline Marois invited Philippe Couillard to stand in the vacant constituency of Viau to sit in the National Assembly at the end of September.
