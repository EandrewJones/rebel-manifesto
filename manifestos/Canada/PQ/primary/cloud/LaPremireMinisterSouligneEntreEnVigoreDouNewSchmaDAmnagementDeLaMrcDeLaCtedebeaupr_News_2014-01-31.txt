This plan received a favorable opinion from the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Sylvain Gaudreault.
“The entry into force of the development plan will create more dynamic and sustainable living environments that meet the needs of the citizens of the MRC de La Côte-de-Beaupré. The major orientations put forward by the MRC will result in an optimal use of its resources, while ensuring the harmonious development of its territory ”, declared Pauline Marois.
