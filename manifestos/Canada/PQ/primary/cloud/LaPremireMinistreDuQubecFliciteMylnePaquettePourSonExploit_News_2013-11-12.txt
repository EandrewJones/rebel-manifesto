Quebec - Quebec Premier Pauline Marois congratulates Mylène Paquette, a young woman from the Montreal region, who made it to the port of Lorient, France, after a solo crossing of the Atlantic. She is the first North American rower to achieve this extraordinary feat.
“Mylène&#39;s achievement is quite simply exceptional. This crossing, which initially appeared to be highly risky, finally proved possible. This young woman has shown incredible courage, determination and endurance. She is an example for everyone because, when you set goals and challenges, by dint of perseverance, you can achieve them, ”said the Premier.
On October 24, the Premier had the opportunity to meet with Ms. Paquette to wish her a happy birthday. “Even alone in the middle of the ocean for several weeks now, Mylène breathed happiness, calm and confidence; she was more than determined to complete this ordeal. And she succeeded! I wish her an excellent return to dry land, to her family, friends and colleagues, ”concluded Pauline Marois.
