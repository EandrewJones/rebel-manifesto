Quebec - On this National Patriots&#39; Day, the Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, calls on the population to celebrate and remember a decisive slice of its history.
“Today, Quebeckers can proudly mark National Patriots&#39; Day. It is an opportunity for all of us to revisit our history and in particular that of the Patriots&#39; struggle for better social justice and greater freedom. It is the story of courageous men and women who stood up for their ideals and convictions. We can salute the courage and tenacity of these people, our ancestors, to whom we owe our democratic society. They were able to mark their time, change their destiny and ours. Let&#39;s celebrate this very significant feast together, ”said Pauline Marois.
It was in 2002 that the Government of Quebec proclaimed, by decree, the National Patriots&#39; Day. Established on the Monday preceding May 25 of each year, it replaces the Dollard party. Thus, we wanted to better promote the events of May 1837 when the Patriots held public meetings throughout Quebec after the London government refused to accept their demands. The text of the decree stipulates that &quot;this holiday will underline the struggle of the Patriots of 1837-1838 for the national recognition of our people, for their political freedom and for obtaining a democratic system of government&quot;.
