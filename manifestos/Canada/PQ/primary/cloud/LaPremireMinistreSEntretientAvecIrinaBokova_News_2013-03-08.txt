Quebec - Prime Minister Pauline Marois had a warm meeting this morning with the Director General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, passing through the capital to receive an honorary doctorate from Laval University. During the private interview, Ms. Marois confirmed to the Director General that Quebec intends to continue its participation in the work of UNESCO, even if the Government of Quebec is not a full member state of this organization.
“Quebec must seize every opportunity it has to play a role, to make its voice heard and to promote its expertise on the international scene. As such, UNESCO offers us a formidable forum and we sincerely hope that we can continue to make our contribution to it in the future, ”said the Prime Minister.
Quebec is actively involved in UNESCO&#39;s work, which mainly concerns education, culture, the diversity of cultural expressions and the sciences. In education, Quebec closely follows activities related to open educational resources (OER), adult training and the integration of children in difficulty. It also contributes strongly to the promotion of UNESCO Chairs, while 10 of the UN organization&#39;s 14 chairs in Canada are located on its territory.
In cultural matters, Pauline Marois reminded Ms. Bokova that Quebec&#39;s priority is the implementation of the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, adopted in 2005. “In this era of accelerated globalization, the protection of national cultures must be a priority. For it is through culture and its various forms of expression that peoples forge their identity and determine their future. Quebec has played an important role since the beginning of the work relating to the implementation of the Convention and we intend to continue our efforts in this direction, ”added Ms. Marois.
