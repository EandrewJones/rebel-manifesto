Pauline Marois thanked the president of the short scale, Ms. Hélène Derome, as well as all the authors, illustrators and employees of the publishing house for the 35 years of work accomplished. “Children&#39;s books are the gateway to imagination and knowledge. Your work, because it democratizes access to knowledge, contributes to making Quebec a more just, more open and more educated nation. &quot;

Ms. Marois took the opportunity to underline the donation, by the short scale, of 500 new books to the Literacy Foundation, as part of its La lecture en Cadeau program. This program essentially aims to give a new book to children for whom the relationship to books, within their family, is very often non-existent.
The Premier also praised the initiative of the President and CEO of the Literacy Foundation, Ms. Diane Mockle, for Operation Reading as a Gift. “This campaign allows children to learn the magic of reading and feed their extraordinary curiosity. On their behalf, I thank you, ”said Pauline Marois.
