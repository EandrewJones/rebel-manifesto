Quebec - On the occasion of the 14th World Suicide Prevention Day, the member for Rosemont and the Parti Québécois spokesperson for prevention, Jean-François Lisée, insisted on the importance of prevention and on the need to increase the resources dedicated to it.
&quot;The theme of this edition,&quot; Ignited for suicide prevention &quot;, should encourage Prime Minister Philippe Couillard to ignite, precisely: the various suicide prevention organizations are doing essential work. Every day, they support people who are going through so many difficulties that they think about ending their life, ”said Jean-François Lisée.
The Member points out that suicide unfortunately remains a major issue in our society, and that everything must be done to prevent it. “It is together that we will come to the end of this scourge. However, we must have the necessary resources and support services! Earlier this year, I denounced the significant cuts that were made to suicide prevention budgets, particularly at Suicide Action Montreal, where budget cuts have hurt the delivery of assistance services. However, this group, like the many others who work in suicide prevention, contributes to saving lives, through its work in the field and the unwavering commitment of its artisans, ”continued the spokesperson.
“On this day of mobilization, I say to the Liberal government that it must stop neglecting suicide prevention. Above all, we must not cut resources; on the contrary, we must consolidate and add to them. The 1 866 APPELLE line, for example, provides essential services to people in distress. A suicide is always one suicide too many, ”concluded Jean-François Lisée.
