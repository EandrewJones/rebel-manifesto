Mirabel - The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, attended the groundbreaking for the construction of Place Claude-Léveillée, in Saint-Benoît-de-Mirabel, in the company of the Member for the riding of Mirabel, Denise Beaudoin.
“I am happy to mark today the start of work on the creation of an outdoor living space in tribute to a great man of Quebec song. This structuring project demonstrates the intrinsic links between culture and sustainable development. It illustrates all the cultural vitality that animates the Mirabel region, ”said Minister Kotto.
“It is with great pride that I am here today to mark in such a beautiful way a major step in the development of this stimulating project, which I initiated some time ago. I wanted to set up a place that pays tribute to this great author and performer from our region that was Mr. Claude Léveillée. In this context, I notably provided financial support for the creation of a work by sculptor Sylvain Goulet. I was able to secure the collaboration of several people, first and foremost Mr. Luc Désilets, to arrive at this event which brings us together now. May this Place Claude-Léveillée mean a lot to our young people, to the people of the area and to the population of Mirabel in general, ”said Mirabel MNA Denise Beaudoin.
Recall that, following the death of Claude Léveillée, the elementary school as well as the community of Saint-Benoît-de-Mirabel, with the participation of the Commission scolaire de la Seigneurie-des-Mille-Îles and the Center d &#39; accommodation in Saint-Benoît, wished to underline the imprint left by Mr. Léveillée in the region.
According to the artist, Saint-Benoît-de-Mirabel was a source of inspiration during the fifty years he lived there. An outdoor living space will therefore be set up and will house a work produced by an artist from the region, namely a wrought iron piano and a life-size reproduction of Mr. Léveillée. The creation of this outdoor living space will testify to the importance of his work in Quebec culture.
