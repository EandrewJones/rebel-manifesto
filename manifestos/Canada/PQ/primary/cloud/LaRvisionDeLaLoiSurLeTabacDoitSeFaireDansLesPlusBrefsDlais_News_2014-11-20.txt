Quebec - The Parti Québécois joins its voice to those of the Quebec Coalition for Tobacco Control and the Canadian Cancer Society, which are calling for a review of the Tobacco Act as soon as possible. The MNA for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, youth protection, home care and prevention, Jean-François Lisée, and the MNA for Taillon and spokesperson for health and access to care, Diane Lamarre, are also asking the government to act quickly on this issue.
“Reducing smoking is a collective objective essential to the health of our fellow citizens. The tobacco laws have had positive effects on the smoking rate in Quebec: it has gone from 35% in the mid-1990s to 20% today. We can still do better; other effective measures can be put in place, and this requires a review of the law. Unfortunately, we learned this week that the Minister for Public Health, Lucie Charlebois, will not table a bill before Christmas, as she had nevertheless promised to do, ”said Jean-François Lisée.
Let us recall that the work on this file was started by the government of the Parti Québécois; the Committee on Health and Social Services had made its recommendations, and our government was clear on its intentions to act quickly.
“With what we know today about the damage caused by smoking, we have a responsibility to ensure that our young people never start smoking. We are concerned and very disappointed by this decline of the Liberal government, especially after the cuts to public health announced with Bill 10. We should instead focus on public health and quickly update a law dating from 2005. In addition, it would clearly be an investment; in Quebec, a third of the costs incurred by hospital days are directly attributable to smoking. This also demonstrates the dangers of politicizing the health system, as provided for in Bill 10, because it becomes difficult to implement preventive measures that will give results in 10, 20 or 40 years, ”concluded Diane Lamarre.
