Quebec - The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Ms. Agnès Maltais, recalls the entry into force, on February 1, 2014, of a gradual increase in aid granted to single people, without employment restrictions, recipients of last-resort financial assistance. Thanks to this increase, single people will benefit from an additional $ 600 per year by 2017, for a total annual investment, ultimately, of some $ 71 million.
“Significant progress has been made in Quebec in the fight against poverty in order to continue on this path. Our government made a commitment last May to increase financial assistance for single people. Indeed, their situation remains particularly worrying, as it has steadily deteriorated over the past ten years. We are keeping our word with this increase, which increases their disposable income, ”explained Minister Maltais.
The increase will come into force on February 1, 2014 and will be phased in according to the following schedule:
This measure is in line with the government orientations on which the “Solidarity: a wealth for Quebec” pillar is based, one of the four pillars of government action, along with integrity, prosperity and identity. These guidelines, made public on October 30 by Prime Minister Pauline Marois, will guide the government&#39;s action in implementing measures aimed at improving the well-being of the most vulnerable individuals and families. The government thus wants to give new impetus to solidarity, a value inseparable from collective wealth.
This draft Regulation amending the Regulation respecting assistance to individuals and families was formalized today when it was published in the Gazette officielle du Québec. This follows a pre-publication that occurred on November 1, 2013, which was accompanied by a 45-day deadline for public consultation.
