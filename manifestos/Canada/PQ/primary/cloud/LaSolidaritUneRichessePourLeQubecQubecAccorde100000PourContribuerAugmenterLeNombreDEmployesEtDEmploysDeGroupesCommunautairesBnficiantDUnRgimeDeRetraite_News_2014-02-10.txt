Quebec - The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Ms. Agnès Maltais, announces an investment of $ 100,000 for the implementation of a training and promotion campaign of the Community and Women&#39;s Groups Pension Plan. This measure intended to improve the working conditions of employees in the community sector will make it possible to publicize the pension plan.
“In 2014, a very small proportion of employees in community groups benefited from a pension plan. Our government made a commitment last October to improve their working conditions. The investment announced today will help increase the number of pension plan members and will thus enable them to benefit from better social benefits, ”declared Minister Maltais.
The training and promotion campaign will be carried out by the Relais-femmes organization, in collaboration with those in charge of the Pension Plan for community groups and women. It should be remembered that this new innovative plan won the Plan Sponsor prize awarded by the magazine Benefits Canada, a publication specializing in pension funds.
This measure is in line with the government orientations on which the “Solidarity: a wealth for Quebec” pillar is based, one of the four pillars of government action, along with integrity, prosperity and identity. These guidelines, made public on October 30 by Prime Minister Pauline Marois, will guide the government&#39;s action in implementing measures aimed at improving the well-being of the most vulnerable individuals and families. The government thus wants to give new impetus to solidarity, a value inseparable from collective wealth.
