Quebec - The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Mrs. Agnès Maltais, announces, along with members of the Forum national Emploi-Québec / External Resources, an increase of 3, $ 8 million in funding granted to organizations developing employability supported by Emploi-Québec to help them maintain the quality of services offered to the population.
“The Quebec government made a commitment to better support those who help people. This is what we are doing today by improving the support granted to organizations developing employability. These organizations play a key role in Quebec&#39;s economic development by allowing thousands of Quebecers to enter the job market and improve their living conditions every year. They are essential partners in the fight against poverty and social exclusion and thus contribute to building a more just, more united and more prosperous society, ”explained Minister Maltais.
This investment will also increase the basic funding granted to the 110 carrefours jeunesse-emploi in Quebec.
It should be noted that this announcement is in line with the government orientations on which the pillar &quot;Solidarity: a wealth for Quebec&quot; is based, one of the four pillars of government action, along with integrity, prosperity and identity. These guidelines, made public on October 30 by Prime Minister Pauline Marois, guide government action in the implementation of measures aimed at improving the well-being of the most vulnerable individuals and families. The government thus wants to give new impetus to solidarity, a value inseparable from collective wealth.
