Quebec– Nicolas Marceau, MP for Saint-Jérôme and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, MP for Rousseau and Parti Québécois Finance and Revenue Critic, and MP for Chicoutimi, House Leader and spokesperson for the economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Stéphane Bédard, urged the Liberal government to act for employment, while more than 4,000 were lost, to full time, in August.
“Job losses continue and Liberal Prime Minister Philippe Couillard persists in doing nothing. The unemployment rate in Quebec is 8%. Quebec continues to underperform since the arrival of the Liberal government. I suggested to the Prime Minister to hold an economic summit bringing together all the players in order to propose solutions. He still refuses. The population is worried, I see it when I am on tour. What is the government waiting for to act? For my part, I will continue to meet with Quebecers and economic decision-makers, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“The Minister of Finance must advance the tabling of the economic and fiscal update, as we asked him last week. In addition to the jobs lost this summer, GDP fell another 0.5% in May, after falling 0.3% in April and 0.1% in March. While the budget anticipated a 2% increase in GDP, the growth forecast for 2015 was lowered to just 1.3% by Desjardins. Quebeckers need to know where we are and what the government&#39;s budgetary situation is, ”added Nicolas Marceau.
“Philippe Couillard&#39;s refusal to present an economic policy and liberal austerity undermine the job market. The government acts only on the expenditure column; he forgets that of income, and we see the results. There is no plan, only improvisation. Only 7.9% of full-time jobs created in Canada were created in Quebec. The Liberals must stop turning a blind eye and hoping; they must act as quickly as possible, the situation demands it, ”concluded Stéphane Bédard.
