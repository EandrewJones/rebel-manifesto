Quebec, May 7, 2017 - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of health, access to care and home support, Diane Lamarre, denounces the privatization operated by the Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette, who granted permission for superclinic physicians to hire healthcare professionals themselves outside the CISSS and CIUSSS. She also denounces the withdrawal of the obligation for superclinics to be open 84 hours a week.
IN SHORT
“In his most recent agreement with physicians regarding superclinics, the Minister of Health gave them an unprecedented gift. Whereas previously superclinics staff came from the public health network, superclinics will now be able to hire professionals from the private sector. On the sly, Gaétan Barrette privatized the network of superclinics, it is a liberal &quot;superprivatization&quot;, denounced Diane Lamarre.
“After having cut without scruples and without justification in hospitals, CLSCs and CHSLDs, among others, the Minister spontaneously finds money for private clinics. For three years, it has financed a private business model and weakened the means of the public, yet guaranteeing equitable access for all to health care, ”she continued.
“Allowing superclinics to hire staff with money from the Ministry of Health is not going to improve the accessibility and quality of services, especially since they no longer have to be open a minimum of 84 hours per week. Why and for whom did the minister make these decisions? What interests do they serve? The Minister, once again, relegates the interest of the population to the background and continues to privatize the health network, ”concluded the spokesperson.
