Sherbrooke - The Minister of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology, Mr. Pierre Duchesne, inaugurated the Center for Research and Training by Simulation (CEREFS), linked to the pilot project of learning laboratory assisted by simulator mannequins of the Cégep de Sherbrooke. Remember that this pilot project was born in particular thanks to government financial support totaling $ 970,000, including $ 670,000 from the Ministry of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology and $ 300,000, from the Department of Health and Social Services.
“The establishment of this new laboratory demonstrates the importance that we attach to the training of the student population in the field of health, where the need for skilled labor is particularly high. By providing innovative facilities, the Cégep de Sherbrooke will allow its students to stand out and develop the skills required to exercise their future careers, in addition to encouraging them to persevere. This will also make it possible to meet the needs of the community regarding continuing education, research and development in the health field, ”said Minister Duchesne.
The CEREFS is used by students in four study programs, two in vocational training (Health, assistance and nursing care and Assistance to the person in a health establishment) and two in technical training (Nursing care and Techniques of respiratory therapy). The availability of the new laboratory should promote increased enrollment in these study programs. It also aims to ensure better preparation of students for internships and the practice of the profession. The CEREFS also allows them to evolve in an interdisciplinary context, working alongside respiratory therapists and other members of the nursing staff, as is the case in the hospital environment.
