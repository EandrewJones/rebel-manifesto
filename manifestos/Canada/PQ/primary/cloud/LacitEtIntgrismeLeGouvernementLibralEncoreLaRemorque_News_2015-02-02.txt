Quebec - The member for Taschereau, parliamentary leader and official opposition spokesperson for secularism, Agnès Maltais, asks the Liberal Prime Minister to stop being behind others on issues affecting the secularism of the State and fundamentalism.
“This time, it is the mayor of Montreal, of Paris, who announces the holding of a summit on integration and security in Montreal. We will look with interest at the possibility of participating. But, for his part, the Prime Minister remains vague and still refuses to give us a precise timetable for the actions his government intends to take on these issues. He continues to maintain the vagueness and play with words to hide his discomfort and inaction, ”said Agnès Maltais.
“At a time when everyone wants the government to take responsibility, we applaud those who have the courage to make decisions to protect our young people from dangerous speech. We need guidelines, we need leadership. The mayor of the Mercier – Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough has done well in Imam Chaoui&#39;s case. Now, to assume its responsibilities, the government must not wait for another radical imam to request permission to preach in another city or another borough of Montreal. It is time to end it on a case-by-case basis, ”she added.
Observatory on religious fundamentalism The MP recalled the upcoming tabling of her bill to set up an observatory on religious fundamentalism. “The government has still not responded favorably to our proposal. The observatory would allow us to understand, document and prevent religious fundamentalism. The government must tell us what it intends to do, precisely, on this issue, ”concluded Agnès Maltais.
