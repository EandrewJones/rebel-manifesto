Quebec - The member for Taschereau and official opposition critic for secularism, Agnès Maltais, once again notes that the Liberal government continues to push back the issue of secularism and that of equality between men and the women.
The day after the election, however, the leader of the Liberal Party said he would tackle the problem &quot;very early&quot; in the mandate. In June, the Minister of Justice, Stéphanie Vallée, promised that a bill would be tabled in the fall of 2014, a commitment that was obviously not respected. Yesterday she said it would be done before summer. Today, the Prime Minister finally admitted that he was putting off this electoral commitment. Clearly, the government is navigating this file on sight.
“Philippe Couillard never intended to tackle issues related to the secularism of the State and equality between men and women. What he would like is to sweep these issues under the rug. The only thing he has done in this matter since his election is to shovel the problem forward, ”said Agnès Maltais.
“This is a new broken promise by the Prime Minister. Why is he doing this? The answer is simple: he is not comfortable with this file. He knows full well that Quebeckers do not share his vision. When he talks about these issues, he quickly raises his voice, a clear sign of his discomfort in the face of these questions, ”said the member for the Parti Québécois.
