The leader of the official opposition, Jean-François Lisée, the vice-chef and spokesperson for family and justice, Véronique Hivon, and the spokesperson for finance, Nicolas Marceau, presented today the Parti Québécois proposal to promote competition in the Quebec economy, so that consumers benefit from lower prices and increased purchasing power: the creation of the Bureau de la protection des consommateurs du Québec.
IN SHORT
“Over the past twenty years, in Canada, we have seen signs that the markets are less competitive, more concentrated. As a result, goods and services are more expensive and companies are making unusually high profits. In short, Quebec consumers are being tricked: while many make it difficult to make ends meet, they are paying too much for what they consume, ”declared Nicolas Marceau.
This is why the Parti Québécois is committed to creating the Bureau de la protection des consommateurs du Québec. “In Canada, the Competition Bureau has a responsibility to maintain healthy competition and fight anti-competitive business practices, but it does it very badly; it is soft, lacking in rigor, it is ineffective. In Quebec, we have the Office de la protection des consommateurs, but its mandate does not cover anti-competitive practices or abuse of a dominant position, ”continued Jean-François Lisée.
“With the Quebec Consumer Protection Bureau, there will be real investigations and real consequences for businesses that abuse Quebeckers. Thus, there will be more competition in our economy, prices will be lower, the purchasing power of consumers will be increased. In short, our entire economy will benefit, ”concluded Nicolas Marceau.
