Quebec - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, as well as the MNA for Taschereau and spokesperson for secularism, Agnès Maltais, denounce the attitude of the Liberal MP for LaFontaine, Marc Tanguay, who invited the population &quot;to be open&quot; after being informed that a community center that he had agreed to sponsor financially, through an advertisement , hosts on its website writings advocating the submission of women and violence against them. Although he has withdrawn his advertising, after being summoned to do so by his Prime Minister, Marc Tanguay must still apologize for having trivialized violence against women.
“When it comes to violence, there is no &#39;opening&#39;, no possible compromise; any call for violence must be condemned. Marc Tanguay must apologize for having endorsed remarks advocating the domination of men as well as physical and psychological violence against women. How can this Liberal MP ask for &quot;nuances&quot; when it comes to the physical and mental integrity of women? », Asked Carole Poirier.
“Since the Liberal Party came to power, we have witnessed an incredible series of about-faces in the issues of secularism and fundamentalism. Think of Minister Weil, who was prepared to hire a fundamentalist in her cabinet, or even of the Prime Minister who keeps playing on words while constantly rejecting the introduction of a bill. Marc Tanguay is not his first unacceptable misstep, he who said last year that he would have no problem with a PLQ candidate wearing the chador. The government must accept our suggestion and create a post of observer of religious fundamentalism in order to document the phenomenon and, thus, to prevent violent comments ending up on the Web, endorsed by elected officials ”, concluded Agnès Maltais. .
