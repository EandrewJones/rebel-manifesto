Lac-Mégantic– The Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet, announces that Montreal, Maine &amp; Atlantique Canada Cie, Montreal, Maine &amp; Atlantic Railway Ltd, Western Petroleum Company and World Fuel Services Corporation responded to the order served on them Monday, but made no clear or firm commitment to abide by its terms. The Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks (MDDEFP) and its lawyers are analyzing their responses in order to define their scope.
“It is still too early to understand the concrete effects of the response we have received, but it goes without saying that we do not consider this response to be satisfactory in the short term. In any case, the ordinance is a means that will allow us to ensure that the work is completed completely and that the companies will assume the financial burden of the restoration operations to come. The downtown area must be rebuilt and the return to normalcy must be done quickly, for the benefit of the region&#39;s economy and the quality of life of the citizens of Lac-Mégantic, ”stated Minister Blanchet.
The government is currently working to establish solid mechanisms with the City of Lac-Mégantic that will ensure the continuation of operations and their payment in the event of a business default. It should be remembered that if the parties affected by the order refuse or neglect to comply fully with it, the Minister could avail himself of his power to have the order executed at the expense of the parties concerned and to recover the costs thereof, in accordance with the article 113 of the Environment Quality Act.
In the meantime, the Ministry ensures that the work continues without interruption and that all the necessary staff and equipment are deployed to ensure effective action on the ground.
