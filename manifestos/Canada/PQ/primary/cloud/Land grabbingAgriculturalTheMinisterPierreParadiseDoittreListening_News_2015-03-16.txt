Quebec - As the hearings of the parliamentary committee on farmland grabbing begin, the member for Berthier and official opposition spokesperson for agriculture, André Villeneuve, asks the Liberal and Caquist MPs to listen to people affected by this growing phenomenon in Quebec.
“On my initiative, a parliamentary committee is looking into land grabbing. Today and tomorrow, we will hear from speakers grappling with speculation and the purchase of agricultural land by private investment firms. The agricultural world, especially the next generation, is worried about the impact of the actions of these firms. I am happy that my fellow Members have accepted that these hearings be held, ”declared André Villeneuve.
“I am confident that possible solutions can be found. At the Parti Québécois, we are in listening mode, we are there to find answers. We hope that the Liberal and CAQ members will also be open, just as we hope that Minister Pierre Paradis will hear the people affected by the grabbing of farmland, so that we can move towards sustainable solutions to guarantee a place for succession and to ensure that farmers retain ownership of their land, ”added the deputy.
