Quebec - The deputy for Berthier and official opposition spokesperson for agriculture, fisheries and food, André Villeneuve, is delighted that the deputies who are members of the Agriculture and Fisheries Committee, Energy and Natural Resources will hear from stakeholders affected by speculation and the purchase of agricultural land by private investment firms. This proposal by the Parti Québécois was indeed accepted this morning.
“Private investment firms, notably the Pangea firm, headed by Charles Sirois, co-founder of the CAQ, covet agricultural land in several regions of Quebec. This speculation drives up the value of these lands, making access even more difficult for the next generation. The agricultural world is worried - young farmers, in particular - about the impact of the actions of private firms. It is important to hear from the stakeholders affected by this issue, ”said André Villeneuve.
“Agriculture is a very important economic sector for the regions of Quebec. How can young farmers hope for a future when, increasingly, acquiring farmland can only be done at a price beyond their means? The government must work with local stakeholders to find lasting solutions, especially for the next generation. Thanks to the Parti Québécois, possible solutions can be formulated directly to parliamentarians, ”concluded André Villeneuve.
