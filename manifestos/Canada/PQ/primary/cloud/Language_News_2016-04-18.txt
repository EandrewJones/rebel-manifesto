Quebec - On the occasion of the study of the budget appropriations of the Ministry of Culture and Communications, Charter of the French language section, the member for Bourget and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois responsible for the Charter of the French language, Maka Kotto, denounces the government&#39;s procrastination regarding the display language. He recalled that the Minister and the Prime Minister had promised, a year ago, to tighten Bill 101 to force retailers displaying a trademark in English to add a description in French.
“By procrastination or ideology, the Liberal government systematically refuses to be more offensive in defending the French language. Either the promised regulations are still pending, or the government refuses to legislate. Language is, however, the foundation on which the Quebec nation is based; we must invest the necessary efforts to ensure its advancement and influence. For fifteen years, the progression of French has run out of steam in Quebec. And the Liberal government is far from reassuring us, ”said Maka Kotto.
“As for the language of work - especially on construction sites, for example those of Davie or CHUM -, the Minister promised a regulation a year ago. Nothing since. It is the same thing in the file of the posting, for which the announced regulation will not change anything. As for the renewal of the Common Intervention Strategy for Greater Montreal, we were promised consultations in the fall and a new version for April 1, but we are still waiting. We said it last year: the Office québécois de la langue française went from 8 to 4 inspectors, while the number of complaints is increasing. However, the inspectors dismissed were not even replaced, ”he added.
