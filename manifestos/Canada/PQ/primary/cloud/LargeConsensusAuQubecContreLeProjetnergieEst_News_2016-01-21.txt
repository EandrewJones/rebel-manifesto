Quebec - Following the decision of the Montreal Metropolitan Community (CMM) to oppose the TransCanada Energy East pipeline project, the Parti Québécois spokesperson for sustainable development, the environment and the fight Against climate change, Mathieu Traversy, as well as the spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, urge the government of Philippe Couillard to note the total lack of social acceptability and to abandon the project.
“The MWC decision confirms that the Energy East pipeline project is not receiving any support. The CMM comprises nearly half of the population of Quebec. It is therefore a clear and strong message that is being sent to the government today: Energy East will not pass! Quebecers refuse to serve as a highway for the export of oil from the tar sands, ”said Mathieu Traversy.
“Month after month, we see that the Energy East project would do nothing for Quebec. Too modest economic benefits for too great risks. Instead of opposing Quebec energy projects, can Philippe Couillard defend Quebec&#39;s interests and oppose TransCanada&#39;s ambitions? Quebecers do not have to pay the price for decisions made for the sole benefit of the rest of Canada, ”added Alain Therrien.
The Parti Québécois also recalls that an independent Quebec would be stronger and better equipped to fight climate change. “As long as we are a province, projects like TransCanada&#39;s Energy East pipeline will try to make Quebec a simple passage for Alberta oil. We would therefore have everything to gain by making our own choices, ”concluded Mathieu Traversy.
