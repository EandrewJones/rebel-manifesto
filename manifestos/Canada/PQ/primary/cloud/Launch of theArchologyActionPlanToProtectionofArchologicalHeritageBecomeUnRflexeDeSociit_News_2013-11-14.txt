Quebec - The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, takes advantage of the 14th annual Forum of the Archéo-Québec network to make public the archaeological action plan and thus affirm his commitment to archaeological heritage.
“Rich and remarkable, the archaeological heritage reveals unpublished pages of our history. It therefore seemed essential to give ourselves clear guidelines in order to conserve and enhance this cultural, historical and identity resource. The action plan released today is based on the conviction that archaeological heritage is everyone&#39;s business and that it represents an essential component of Quebec&#39;s cultural landscape, ”said Minister Kotto.
This action plan aims, among other things, to include the archaeological heritage in the cultural, social and economic development of Quebec. Three major orientations will guide its implementation, namely the prioritization of ministerial action affecting the knowledge, protection and enhancement of this heritage, the strengthening of interdepartmental consultation and the support of local partners. This plan is an affirmation of the commitment of the Ministry of Culture and Communications to the protection and enhancement of this rich heritage and essential to Quebec society.
The action plan was drawn up in the wake of the adoption of the Cultural Heritage Act and the revision of the Regulation on archaeological research of the Ministry of Culture and Communications. It contains a series of actions aimed at improving practices, equipping archaeologists and promoters and raising awareness of this fascinating field.
The archeology action plan is available on the website of the Ministère de la Culture et des Communications, atwww.mcc.gouv.qc.ca.
