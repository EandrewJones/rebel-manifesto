Quebec - The Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks announces the launch of calls for tenders for qualification for decontamination work in Lac-Mégantic. The characterization work aimed at determining the extent of soil contamination is in the process of being completed and the Department will soon be able to identify the delays to be expected and the technologies that should be prioritized during the decontamination process.
It is clear that the decontamination of this site requires major operations. To this end, the Department is launching today a series of four qualification calls for tenders, including two for construction work and two for professional services. Entrepreneurs and firms interested in exercising their know-how are invited to complete a qualification file which will be the subject of a rigorous analysis by a selection committee. This process will make it possible to constitute a list of qualified companies which will be able to undertake the work quickly. The documents will be accessible on the government&#39;s electronic tendering system (SEAO). The first contracts will be awarded from the beginning of October.
It should also be noted that the work deemed to be a priority, for example operations linked to the decontamination of the railway, will be carried out in parallel with the call for tenders process which has just started. In addition, recovery and clean-up work is continuing in Lac-Mégantic. Remember that the Pomerleau firm was given the mandate to coordinate this work.
