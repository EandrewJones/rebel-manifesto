Québec - The MP for Vachon and official opposition spokesperson for transport, Martine Ouellet, as well as the MP for Verchères and spokesperson for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, denounce the federal laxity regarding rail safety and ask the Quebec government to put pressure on Ottawa to meet its commitments.
Yesterday, in the wake of the report on the Lac-Mégantic rail tragedy, we learned that the Transportation Safety Board (BST) was concerned about the lack of responses provided and commitments made by Transport Canada.
“According to the TSB, we have not yet put in place an effective monitoring system that would ensure that all railway companies are properly inspected; this is unacceptable! A year and a half has passed since the Lac-Mégantic tragedy, and Transport Canada has still not taken all the necessary corrective measures to prevent such an accident from happening again. Quebec Transport Minister Robert Poëti is to stand in front of Ottawa and meet with his federal counterpart. If he does not defend Quebecers, who will? », Declared Martine Ouellet.
“Ottawa continues to shirk its responsibilities. This willful blindness of the government must end. Clear actions must be taken to ensure the safety of the population. It is unacceptable that all the necessary measures have not yet been deployed. The federal government must fulfill its commitments, ”concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
