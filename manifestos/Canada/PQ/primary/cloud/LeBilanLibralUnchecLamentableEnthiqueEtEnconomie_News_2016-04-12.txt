Quebec - The leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, considers that the two main objectives that Liberal leader Philippe Couillard set himself during the 2014 election campaign, namely to enhance his party&#39;s ethics and to stimulate the economy, have resulted in a dismal failure.
“In terms of ethics, the last few weeks have been marked by the arrest of his former colleague Nathalie Normandeau, the accusations of corruption against one of the most important fundraisers of the Liberal Party, Marc-Yvan Côté, and, finally, the procrastination on the part of the Prime Minister when it came to his friend, the deputy for Louis-Hébert, Sam Hamad, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
On the economy side, the Liberal government has not created any jobs over the past twelve months. On Friday, we learned that another 22,500 full-time jobs had been lost during the month of March. In addition, on page C.26 of its own budget, the government plans to create less than 30,000 jobs in 2016 and less than 30,000 jobs in 2017. These figures prove the abandonment of the promise to create 250,000 jobs.
“The Prime Minister refused to confirm his choice to no longer include the promise, the objective, the liberal myth of 250,000 jobs in the budget. It is clear that he admits to having sold a mirage to voters during the last electoral campaign, ”added Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“Philippe Couillard had promised to change the Liberal Party. He needs to recognize the problem today: he didn&#39;t make the right change. He abandoned the economy and kept the ethical issues rather than doing the opposite, ”concluded the leader of the Parti Québécois.
