Montreal - The Parti Québécois candidate in the Chicoutimi constituency and President of the Treasury Board, Stéphane Bédard, and the candidate in Jonquière and Minister of Transport, Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Sylvain Gaudreault, have I was astounded to hear Philippe Couillard downplaying the impact of the liberal blockade on the holding of the Commission of Inquiry into the Granting and Management of Public Contracts in the Construction Industry (CEIC).
“In just eight months, thanks to new measures, the Parti Québécois government saved Quebecers $ 240 million, just in road works. How much would we have saved if the Liberal government had listened to us from the start? », Asked Sylvain Gaudreault.
Indeed, questioned by journalists during a press briefing on the consequences of the negligence of the liberal regime in establishing the Charbonneau commission, Philippe Couillard lamented the delay in setting up the commission, while specifying that this delay had no consequences.
“All the sums that we have overpaid in infrastructure projects, we will never see them again. The Liberal Party must do a serious examination of its conscience on the money that was wasted during these two years during which the people of Quebec were waiting for their government to finally listen to them, ”added Stéphane Bédard.
The next government will inherit the CEIC report. &quot;People must trust the Parti Québécois government, which has shown that it places integrity at the center of its concerns, rather than the Liberal Party, which has done the opposite during its nine years in power,&quot; said concluded the candidates.
We have a plan and the team to be successful. Today, it is time to give ourselves the means to go even further.
