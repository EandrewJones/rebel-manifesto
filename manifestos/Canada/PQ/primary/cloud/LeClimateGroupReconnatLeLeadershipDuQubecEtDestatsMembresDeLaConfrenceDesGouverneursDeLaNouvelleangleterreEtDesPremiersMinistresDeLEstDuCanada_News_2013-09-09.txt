Quebec– Quebec Premier Pauline Marois is pleased to receive, on behalf of the Conference of New England Governors and Eastern Canadian Premiers (CGNA-PMEC), the “Leader in the fight against climate change ”awarded by the Climate Group. This recognition underlines the leadership of Member States in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and the results achieved by governments in the region in terms of adaptation to climate change and sustainable transport.
“It is an honor to receive, as co-chair of this meeting, this award which recognizes the remarkable achievements of the members of the Conference in the fight against climate change. For several years, we have positioned ourselves as pioneers in this field and we have the firm intention of continuing our efforts to make our environment healthier for future generations ”.
Note that the CGNA-PMEC was the first group of federated states to take common and concrete measures, through a regional action plan in 2001, to face the challenges of climate change. This initiative enabled the region to achieve the objectives it had set for 2010.
This distinction was presented on the sidelines of the 37th Annual Conference of New England Governors and Eastern Canadian Premiers which concludes today in La Malbaie.
Founded in 2004, the Climate Group is an independent, not-for-profit organization that works with multinationals, cities and state and regional governments on the issue of climate change. Quebec has been a member since 2008.
