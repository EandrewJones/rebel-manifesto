Montreal - The National Youth Committee of the Parti Québécois (CNJPQ) welcomes the adoption of Law 13 concerning out-of-constituency voting in the premises of post-secondary educational institutions. “The government has just made an important gesture for democracy. This new law will promote the vote of young voters ”affirmed Mr. Frédéric St-Jean, president of the CNJPQ.
This is a long-standing concern of the CNJPQ. It was also shared by all the youth wings of political parties in Quebec last year, on the eve of the general election. This idea resonated with the ears of Prime Minister Pauline Marois, who had herself submitted the request in an open letter in Le Devoir on November 30, 2011. Even the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec (DGEQ) had then taken a position. in favor of the project. &quot;We are pleased to see that the Parti Québécois government, unlike its predecessor, takes the voices of young people into consideration and acts accordingly,&quot; declared Mr. St-Jean. “This is a project that transcends generations and encourages the greatest possible electoral participation,” he added. The CNJPQ is also satisfied to see that all parliamentarians followed suit and unanimously voted in favor of this new law. &quot;This testifies to the irreproachable work of the Minister of Democratic Institutions and Citizen Participation, Bernard Drainville, who was able to rally all his colleagues behind the voice of young people&quot;.
Only 62.1% of voters aged 18 to 24 asserted their right to vote in 2012, the CNJPQ is of the opinion that we must do everything possible to promote an increase in their participation. &quot;With the adoption of Law 13, nearly 450,000 young people will have direct access to a polling station in their school, this is a major investment in our democracy.&quot; to conclude Mr. St-Jean.
