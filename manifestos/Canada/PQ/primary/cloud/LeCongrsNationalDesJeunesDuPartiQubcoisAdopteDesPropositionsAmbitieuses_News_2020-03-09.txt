Montreal, March 8, 2020 - During the Congress held on March 7 and 8 in Montreal, the youth delegates of the Parti Québécois adopted ambitious proposals, constituting their demands against the candidates in the leadership race. These demands will be made by the new youth executive, elected on this occasion and led by the new youth president of the Parti Québécois, Alec Ordon.
Over the weekend, more than 120 young members discussed the proposals tabled by the youth executive of the Parti Québécois, aimed in particular at establishing the foundations of an independent Quebec. Proposals were adopted, among others, to hold a referendum on the independence of Quebec in the first term of a Parti Québécois government, to create a Quebec currency in the first ten years of a Quebec country, or to limit the normal work week to 35 hours.
“I have said it since my campaign for the presidency: the independence of Quebec is the project of all regions, of Quebecers of all origins and of all generations. You are a responsible, daring youth, capable of dreaming and capable of acting. Quebec has confidence in you. The Parti Québécois trusts you. Let us continue to build together a greener Quebec, open to the world, and free. »Declared Dieudonné Ella Oyono, president of the Parti Québécois.
&quot;It is a great pride for me to see so many young people ready to work a whole weekend to imagine what the foundations of a sovereign Quebec would be and to work concretely for the realization of this great project that is our national independence. . Youth is the future of the Parti Québécois, but it is also the future of Quebec. And we will continue to work to give ourselves the means to build it. »Concluded Alec Ordon, president of the national youth council of the Parti Québécois.
