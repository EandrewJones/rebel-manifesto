Montreal, December 13, 2019 - In accordance with what was announced at the extraordinary national convention on November 9 and 10 in Trois-Rivières, the national executive council commissioned, last month, a study on the branding of the party. . The objective of this study was to analyze the possibility of changing the name and the logo of the Parti Québécois.
Having read the results of this study, the members of the national executive council of the Parti Québécois decided not to change the name of the party. “The name of the Parti Québécois sums up our mission, our commitment and the direction we want to take. We are the party of all Quebeckers, whether they arrived yesterday or 400 years ago; the party of all those who believe in Quebec and its ability to realize its full potential, ”summarized Dieudonné Ella Oyono, President of the Parti Québécois.
As for the possibility of making a change of graphic identity, which would include a new logo, it will be discussed following the leadership race. Moreover, the rules concerning the latter will be adopted during the coordination conference on February 1, 2020.
No further comments will be made regarding the study or the resolution taken by the National Executive Board.
