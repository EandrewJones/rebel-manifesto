Quebec - The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for justice, Alexandre Cloutier, reacted to the latest developments relating to the accident involving a police officer in pursuit that caused the death of a young person 5-year-old boy, in February 2014 in Longueuil. He calls for more transparency from the Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions (DPCP).
Earlier today, we learned that the DPCP, after having taken cognizance of the recommendations of the Special Committee responsible for analyzing the independent investigation file, finally filed an accusation against the Sûreté du Québec police officer who was taking part. to intervention: he is accused of dangerous driving causing death.
“Today&#39;s result is overdue. It is not normal that it took so much pressure - from the official opposition, the media and the parents of the young victim, among others - for the minister to intervene with the DPCP, which had decided, at first, not to lay charges against the police officer, but without making known his reasons. Why did the family have to fight the system to be explained the ins and outs of the DPCP decision? It&#39;s insane, ”lamented Alexandre Cloutier.
Today, the member for Lac-Saint-Jean extended his hand to the Minister of Justice, Stéphanie Vallée. &quot;We ask him to intervene to ensure that the DPCP is henceforth obliged to make public its reasons when it decides not to lay charges against a police officer on duty involved in a fatal accident or causing serious injuries. The DPCP is not a court and must justify its decisions to the population, all the more so to the relatives of the victims, who are entitled to an explanation. It is a question of transparency, which in no way calls into question the independence of the DPCP, ”he concluded.
