Quebec - The member for Sanguinet, Mr. Alain Therrien, is pleased to announce, on behalf of the Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, that two grants totaling nearly of $ 1.5 million are granted to the Roussillon and Le Richelain intermunicipal transport councils for the operation of a public transport service.
A subsidy of $ 484,373 is paid to the Roussillon intermunicipal transport council. For its part, the Conseil intermunicipal de transport Le Richelain is granted a sum of $ 1,047,950. These subsidies are paid under the Government Assistance Program for Public Transit (PAGTCP). The objective of the program is to develop public transport in order to make it the main mode of travel.
“Our government encourages and supports the development of public transit, which makes it possible to optimize the use of the road network while increasing the fluidity of travel, reducing the level of congestion and reducing pollution attributable to the consumption of hydrocarbons. . Today&#39;s announcement will allow the Montérégie region to continue its efforts in the area of public transit, ”said MP Alain Therrien.
&quot;By participating in the financing of public transit, we are investing in sustainable development and the mobility of people, a social, environmental and economic issue that is at the heart of our government&#39;s mission,&quot; added Minister Sylvain Gaudreault.
“These subsidies will help maintain an efficient public transport service that meets the needs of the population served by these two intermunicipal transport councils,” concluded the member for Sanguinet.
The parameters of this program can be viewed on the website of the Ministère des Transports at www.mtq.gouv.qc.ca.
