Quebec - The member for Berthier, Mr. André Villeneuve, is pleased to announce, on behalf of the Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, that a grant of $ 100,000 is granted to the regional county municipality of D&#39;Autray to support the operation of regional public transit.
This subsidy is paid within the framework of the government assistance program for regional public transport intended for the development of public transport.
This project consists of operating a public transport service in the territory of the regional county municipality of D&#39;Autray in order to offer the population better transport services by making maximum use of the resources already in place.
“By participating in the financing of public transit, we are investing in sustainable development and the mobility of people, a social, environmental and economic issue that is at the heart of our government&#39;s mission. Finally, I am delighted that the MRC de D&#39;Autray was able to obtain the maximum amount granted under this program, ”declared Mr. Villeneuve.
Public transit is one of the cornerstones of the next Québec Sustainable Mobility Policy. Currently being developed, this policy will take over from the Québec Public Transport Policy. The new policy will place the user at the heart of his concerns and will guide the actions that will be undertaken by 2020 with a view to improving the public transport service offer throughout Quebec. The preparatory documents as well as some of the briefs filed during the consultation can be viewed on the website of the Ministère des Transports at www.mtq.gouv.qc.ca.
The parameters of this program can be viewed on the website of the Ministère des Transports at www.mtq.gouv.qc.ca.
