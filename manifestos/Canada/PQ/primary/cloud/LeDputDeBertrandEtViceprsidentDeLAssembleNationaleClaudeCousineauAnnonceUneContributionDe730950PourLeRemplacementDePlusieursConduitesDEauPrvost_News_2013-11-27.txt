Prévost - The Vice-President of the National Assembly and Member of Parliament for Bertrand, Mr. Claude Cousineau, is pleased to announce today, on behalf of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Minister of Transport and Member of Parliament for Jonquière, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, that the City of Prévost will benefit from a maximum government financial assistance of $ 730,950 for the replacement of several drinking water and wastewater pipes in the city. This assistance is granted under the Quebec-Municipalities Infrastructure Program (PIQM).
Briefly, the project aims to replace drinking water pipes under certain segments of des Ormes, de la Falaise, Therrien streets as well as Manse-Boisé road. At the end of this work, drinking water pipes over nearly 850 meters will be renewed in the City of Prévost.
“I am very happy with the financial support granted today to the City of Prévost. All Quebecers must be able to benefit from access to quality public services. That is why our government is committed to providing municipalities with the support they need to renew and develop their infrastructure, ”said MNA Claude Cousineau.
&quot;By contributing to the maintenance and renewal of our public infrastructures, the government reiterates its desire to support the social and economic development of municipalities and regions, in the interest of all Quebecers,&quot; said Minister Sylvain Gaudreault.
Completion of this project requires maximum government financial assistance of $ 730,950 under component 1.5 of the PIQM. With a total envelope of $ 462 million, this component of the PIQM program not only ensures the sustainability of infrastructure, but also improves the quality of life of the population and creates many jobs in all areas. regions of Quebec.
The Quebec government&#39;s support for the project is part of the 2013-2023 Quebec Infrastructure Plan (PQI) made public last April. It should be remembered that this ten-year plan will ultimately result in investments of $ 8.1 billion for the municipal infrastructure component. It will have a major economic impact throughout Quebec, with nearly 60,000 jobs created or maintained on average per year.
The PQI also marks a shift in the way we invest and manage public infrastructure. This new way of doing things will make it possible to prospectively assess the needs, based on the priorities of Quebecers, to properly measure the associated costs and thus make informed choices.
