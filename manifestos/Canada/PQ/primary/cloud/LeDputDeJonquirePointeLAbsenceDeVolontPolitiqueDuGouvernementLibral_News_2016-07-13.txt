Jonquière, July 13, 2016 - The member for Jonquière and leader of the official opposition, Sylvain Gaudreault, reminds the people and the government of Quebec that the Graphic Packaging factory closed its doors wildly a year ago today &#39;hui.
This company acquired the old Cascades cardboard factory in December 2014, and then closed it seven months later. Since then, the Liberal government has never shown a clear political will to revive the facilities.
“It is sad to underline the first anniversary of the closure of this plant, which had nevertheless developed a new process that was the envy of many companies. Once again, the Liberal government has let go of an innovative product and hundreds of direct and indirect jobs in our region, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
“Government laissez-faire has led Graphic Packaging to sell the facilities to a scrap dealer who sells off the equipment through an auction. I still believe that the cardboard factory has extraordinary potential for an innovative project that creates jobs. I continue to offer my support to workers in this regard, as long as the facilities are not completely demolished, ”concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
