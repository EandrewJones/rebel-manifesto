Quebec - Troubled by the accusation of illegal fishing which has just fallen for the Liberal MP for Gaspé, Georges Mamelonet, the MP for Matane and official opposition critic for fisheries, Pascal Bérubé, urges the Prime Minister of Quebec, Jean Charest, to act.
“An elected official has the obligation to lead by example. In the present case, it is disturbing to note that the member for Gaspé would have committed an illegal act for the benefit of his company, ”declared Pascal Bérubé.
The Parti Québécois is asking the Prime Minister to remove the Member for Gaspé from his responsibilities as parliamentary assistant to Minister Pierre Corbeil. “Until this story is clarified and settled, it would be inconceivable for Jean Charest to allow the Member for Gaspé to retain his privileges as parliamentary assistant to the Minister responsible for Fisheries. It is a question of elementary ethics, ”concluded Pascal Bérubé.
