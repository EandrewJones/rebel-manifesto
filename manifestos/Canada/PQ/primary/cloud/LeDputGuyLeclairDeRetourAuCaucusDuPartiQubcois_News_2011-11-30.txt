Quebec - MP for Charlevoix and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pauline Marois, announces that MP for Beauharnois, Guy Leclair, will be back in the Parti Québécois caucus. “We had a frank discussion and I&#39;m happy with it. He will be back in caucus starting Thursday, ”she said.
“I did not believe that giving a few thoughts to a journalist in full view of everyone could have generated news of this magnitude. I regret. I have never had a hidden agenda and in this sense, I am very disappointed with the progress of my ex-colleague Daniel Ratthé, ”said the Member for Beauharnois.
“I am returning to my caucus, the only one to which I belong and which I never intended to leave. I return to this with enthusiasm. My leader recognizes in me a member who has convictions and my only objective is to advance Quebec and the cause of sovereignty. In this sense, I will always speak, as I always have done, in the appropriate and agreed forums, with the greatest transparency and frankness towards my boss. The electors of the Beauharnois riding as well as Ms. Marois will always be able to count on my dedication, ”concluded Guy Leclair.
