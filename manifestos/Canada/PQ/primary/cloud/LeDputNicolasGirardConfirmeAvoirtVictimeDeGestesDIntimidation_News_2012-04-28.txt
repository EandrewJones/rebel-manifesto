Quebecâ€“ Gouin MNA Nicolas Girard confirms having been the victim of intimidation.
Last Wednesday evening, around 9 p.m., one or more individuals attempted to intimidate the member. Using a concrete block, the patio door of his private residence in Montreal was shattered. The residence was then unoccupied. After verification, no object was stolen and no other similar act was perpetrated in the area.
Following the procedure, the deputy contacted the police and the security service of the National Assembly.
This is the second time that Nicolas Girard has received threats, of different forms, in the past two years. The first time goes back to 2010 when the member exposed the Liberal child care scandal.
The hon. Member will not comment.
