Quebec - The member for Verchères, Stéphane Bergeron, refutes and is indignant at the interpretation made by the daily Le Devoir of a message calling for the unity of the progressive and sovereignist troops behind the Parti Québécois. Rather, the journalist disguised him as a seed of division. In addition, the article suggests that the deputy believes that the events that have taken place in recent weeks would render Chief Pauline Marois unfit under the circumstances.
“This is delirium! The term unfit comes from the journalist, not from me. Contrary to what the journalist suggests, I believe that Pauline Marois has the will, the courage and the determination necessary to lead the Parti Québécois. She is the person we need to establish a bond of trust with Quebeckers, offer them a reliable and honest government and above all, carry out the sovereignist project, ”declared Stéphane Bergeron.
“By the way, I&#39;m far from throwing the towel! Despite the events that shook our party, I intend to fight alongside Pauline Marois and all of my colleagues in the Parti Québécois caucus in order to continue our rigorous work to regain the confidence of Quebecers and re-engage. Quebec on the road to full emancipation, ”concluded Mr. Bergeron.
