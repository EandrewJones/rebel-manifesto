Bois-des-Filion– On behalf of the Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, the member for Labelle and responsible for the Laurentides region, Sylvain Pagé, today announced an agreement in principle of $ 877,500, for bringing the municipal library of Bois-des-Filion up to standard. The mayor, Paul Larocque, also participated in the event.
“Libraries play a vital role in the growth of communities. In addition to providing privileged access to reading, knowledge and knowledge, they contribute to the cultural and social development of the communities they serve. The involvement of elected officials and partners in the development of this project testifies to a common desire to offer quality services to the citizens of the region, ”said Minister Maka Kotto.
“The aim of upgrading the library is to provide users with adequate and diversified services. An essential resource for the city&#39;s cultural dynamism, the library will be a friendly and stimulating place open to the entire population. The new multifunctional room will certainly contribute to this, ”added MP Pagé.
This agreement in principle will allow the City to carry out preliminary studies and budget estimates leading to the realization of the project. This involves the redevelopment and upgrading of the current library as well as the use of the old premises of the City left vacant. Its new surface area will allow it to better serve customers and provide them with a wider range of works and services. The library will thus be able to enrich its collection, increase its attendance, extend its opening hours and offer an entertainment program intended for all audiences.
The contribution from the Ministry of Culture and Communications, which may be paid upon completion of the necessary studies, will come from the Capital Assistance program. The remainder of the project funding estimated at $ 2,003,645 will be assumed by the City of Bois-des-Filion.
