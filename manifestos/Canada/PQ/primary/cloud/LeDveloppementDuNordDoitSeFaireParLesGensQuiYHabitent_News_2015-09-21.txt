Quebec - Following the inauguration today of the offices of the Société du Plan Nord in Roberval by the Prime Minister, the MP for Duplessis and Parti Québécois spokesperson for northern development, Lorraine Richard, denounces the slowness of the establishment of the Société du Plan Nord branches in northern territory.
“While the slowdown in mining activities has serious consequences on the territory covered by the Plan Nord, workers, businesses and communities are left to fend for themselves. The establishment of the branches of the Société du Plan Nord is long overdue, mines are closing and job losses are increasing. Where is the positive impact of Philippe Couillard&#39;s Plan Nord? Where are the jobs promised? “Asked Lorraine Richard.
“It is disconcerting to note that the Prime Minister is putting all his efforts into the only branch located outside the territory of the Plan Nord. Is this the government&#39;s priority, for the simple reason that it is in the Prime Minister&#39;s riding? The question is valid. If the government was sincere in its desire to develop the economy of northern communities, it should start with the offices located north of the 49th parallel. I will always maintain that the development of the North must be done first and foremost by the people who live there, ”concluded Lorraine Richard.
