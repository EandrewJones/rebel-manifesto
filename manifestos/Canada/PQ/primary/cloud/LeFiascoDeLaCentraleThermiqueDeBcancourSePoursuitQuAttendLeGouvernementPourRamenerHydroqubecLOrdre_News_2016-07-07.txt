Following the decision of the Régie de l&#39;énergie, which confirms the doubts that already surrounded the issue of the unused thermal power station in Bécancour, the member for Sanguinet and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of energy and natural resources , Alain Therrien, asks the government to bring Hydro-Quebec to order and to explain what justified the conclusion of a mutual agreement agreement with TransCanada.
“In its decision, the Régie confirms that Hydro-Québec could have gone to a call for tenders to ensure that it obtained the best possible deal for the energy it says it needs. By not proceeding in this way, Hydro-Québec is going against its obligations in terms of sound management of public funds. The government must bring Hydro-Québec back to order; a call for tenders process must be launched so that Quebecers get the best possible deal, ”said Alain Therrien.
“The agreement reached last year between the Liberal government and TransCanada to extend the Bécancour thermal power plant by 20 years has never been explained in a transparent manner to the public and to parliamentarians. Despite our repeated requests, this agreement was never made public. Last month, we also learned that the cost to reactivate the plant had risen from 45 to 75 M $, an increase of 67% before the work even began! &quot;, he added.
&quot;While Hydro-Québec is pouring tens of millions of dollars into a project that has not even passed the Régie de l&#39;énergie test, the citizens of Bécancour are paying the price for the government&#39;s lack of economic strategy. . Since the Liberals came back to power in 2014, abandoned or delayed projects have multiplied: Stolt LNGaz, IFFCO Canada, Rare Minerals Quest… Quebec needs job creation and the government is doing nothing to improve this unacceptable situation ”, concluded the member for Sanguinet.
