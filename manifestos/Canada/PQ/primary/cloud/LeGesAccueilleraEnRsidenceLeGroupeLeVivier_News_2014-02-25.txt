Montreal - The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, announces an agreement in principle of $ 600,000 for the development of Groupe Le Vivier in Gesù. To the amount announced today, the Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec will add $ 100,000 per year for the next three fiscal years, thus constituting additional assistance for the operation of the Vivier.
“Already recognized on the international scene, the Quebec creators who are members of Groupe Le Vivier, by moving to the Gesù, will be able to continue to enrich the music scene of Montreal and of Quebec as a whole. This agreement will give the public access to the new musical repertoire as well as to the trends of today&#39;s composers, ”said Maka Kotto.
The Le Vivier Group is a specialized broadcaster that brings together 33 organizations or groups of emerging music. It offers a program of concerts throughout the year in line with its mission, which is to promote the development and growth of creative music. Le Vivier&#39;s mandate is centered on dissemination, cultural mediation and the improvement of artistic practice.
The agreement in principle announced today will make it possible to continue defining the development project and finalize its financial package. While pursuing its mission as a center of creativity, the Gesù will thus welcome a new center of creation and research in new and contemporary music. The establishment of the Le Vivier Group in a permanent location, adapted to its mission, will allow the establishment of a real crossroads for new music.
