Quebec - “Against all expectations, the Liberal government has just admitted that there is a decline in French in Montreal and elsewhere in Quebec. The Liberals finally recognize that the French language is being abused in Quebec and that efforts to protect it are insufficient. It was time. Now that this admission has been made, the Liberal government has an obligation to present a strong plan to ensure that Bill 101 is respected. The time for words is over, we want action ”.
This was stated by Drummond MP and official opposition language spokesperson Yves-François Blanchet after the unanimous vote in the National Assembly on the motion tabled by the Parti Québécois.
This motion states:
“By voting in favor of this motion, the Liberal government has just sent the message to the Office québécois de la langue française that it is not making the necessary efforts to enforce the law. Thus, awareness campaigns launched with hundreds of thousands of dollars will not be enough, as will the subsidies for companies that comply with the law. The carrot has no place; we must now brandish the sanction. This is what we expect from the OQLF and the Liberal government, ”concluded Yves-François Blanchet.
