Quebec– The member for Marie-Victorin and official opposition critic for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Bernard Drainville, wonders about the Liberal government&#39;s motives for hiding studies on federalism.
Over the past six years, the Liberal government of Jean Charest has commissioned a dozen studies on federalism. Cost of the bill for Quebec taxpayers: $ 153,000. “When studies are paid for by taxpayers, the least thing is that they are made public. Why does the Liberal government want to keep them secret? », Asks Bernard Drainville.
In 2008, the Liberal government notably commissioned a Memoir on the future of Quebec within the Canadian federation. This brief has aroused some interest since it was the subject of a decision by the Access to Information Commission in January 2010. At the request of the Minister of Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, this brief has remained secret. &quot;What does this memoir contain that cannot be shown?&quot; The question is legitimate, ”indicated Bernard Drainville.
The member for Marie-Victorin notes that the proliferation of studies on federalism, commissioned by the Charest government, also coincides with the arrival of the Harper government in 2006. “The Liberal government has bet everything on the Council of the Federation, which has so far cost Quebec taxpayers more than $ 5 million. As if that weren&#39;t enough, he, in parallel, spent other thousands of dollars on secret studies. It is a lot of money for such a mediocre result and to see a Prime Minister so often and so easily bend his knees to the federal government. Jean Charest seems to forget that he is the premier of Quebec, not that of Canada, ”concluded Bernard Drainville.
