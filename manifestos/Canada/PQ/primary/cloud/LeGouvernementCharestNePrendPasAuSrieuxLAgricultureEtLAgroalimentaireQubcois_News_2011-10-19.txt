Quebec - &quot;By postponing consultations on the green paper for a biofood policy until 2012, the Charest government is making fun of farmers and once again confirms that it does not take the future of the agrifood sector seriously.&quot;
This was stated by the member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata and official opposition critic for agriculture and food, André Simard, surprised that the government is delaying the adoption of a biofood policy.
The MP points out that it is since 2008 that the Charest government has been promising an agricultural policy, following the tabling of the impressive report of the Pronovost commission. “The Charest government consults, goes around in circles, tables reports. Meanwhile, agricultural businesses are dying out. It&#39;s dramatic, ”continued the member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata.
André Simard fears that the presence of the current Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Corbeil, will further harm the agricultural world. “Mr. Corbeil abandoned the forestry sector when he occupied this chair and we know the effects today: the regions are experiencing great tragedies. It makes you wonder if he has not received the same order from his Prime Minister, ”he added.
“The hour is bad for agricultural producers. Many might not survive if nothing happens. Quebec needs a real vision for the future for this sector. The solutions exist, all that&#39;s missing is political will. At the Parti Québécois, we have concrete solutions to help our farmers and to restore credibility to this major economic sector for Quebec and its regions, ”concluded André Simard.
