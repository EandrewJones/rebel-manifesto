Quebec, March 10, 2017 - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for Quebec-Canada relations, Nicolas Marceau, deplored the fact that the Quebec government had totally failed in its negotiations with the federal government and that it had finally signed a significant setback for Quebec in terms of health transfers.
&quot;It is sad to see the Quebec government accepting almost twice as low growth in health transfers, and this only to maintain what already existed, that is to say the lack of accountability in relation to it. with one-off amounts already announced several weeks ago by the federal government. In short, &quot;instead of retreating on two fronts, we have retreated on only one front&quot;; this is what the Couillard government announced today, with obvious embarrassment. This demonstrates, once again, the failure of the Prime Minister&#39;s federalism of collaboration and complacency as well as the inability of the Liberal government to defend the interests of Quebec, ”declared Nicolas Marceau.
Remember that over the past 12 years, federal health transfers have grown by 6% annually. However, this proved insufficient to maintain the federal government&#39;s share in the funding of health care. Then, the Conservative government announced that at the end of the agreement with Quebec and the provinces, in effect since 2014, the growth of the Canada health transfer would be lowered from 6% to 3% per year. This decision will reduce the share of funding provided by Ottawa to less than 20%, when it was originally 50%.
“This unilateral review of health transfers will result in losses of approximately $ 6.5 billion over 10 years for Quebec, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer in Ottawa. Justin Trudeau was outraged by the Conservatives, but today he is imposing the same cut on Quebec, with the blessing of Philippe Couillard and his government, ”Nicolas Marceau concluded.
