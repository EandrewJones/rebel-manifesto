Quebec, August 18, 2016 - The member for Sanguinet and Parti Québécois spokesperson for the economy, energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, wonders why the Couillard government is doing nothing to force Bombardier to maintain jobs in Quebec.
“Considering the financial support the company has received, that would be the least of it. Moreover, the current situation, in addition to being very worrying, illustrates very well that the agreement concluded between the Liberal government and Bombardier contained absolutely no guarantee regarding the maintenance of jobs in Quebec, ”summed up the MP.
The government watches a train built abroad go by “The relocation of aircraft manufacturing activities to Mexico is leading to the loss of several jobs in Quebec. Since last April, at least 92 positions have moved from the Saint Laurent plant in Mexico. When is the government going to wake up? “, Resumed Alain Therrien.
Recalling that Quebecers have collectively invested a billion dollars in the company, the spokesperson invites the government to use this lever to prevent relocations. “Philippe Couillard committed Quebecers&#39; money to a bad deal and, in addition, he does not even try to take advantage of our shares to keep jobs in Quebec. What softness! », He also added.
Bad economic news is piling up As if the case of Bombardier were not enough, we also learn that Desjardins has lowered its growth forecasts for 2016 in Quebec. “The Liberals have no idea, no strategy to stimulate Quebec&#39;s economy. They don&#39;t know how to do it. Worse, it does not even interest the Prime Minister. Growth is anemic; Statistics Canada confirms that Quebec lost 19,500 full-time jobs in July. Right now, in Quebec, there are fewer jobs than at the end of 2015. It is high time that the Liberal Party&#39;s economic inaction ceased, ”concluded Alain Therrien.
