Quebec– MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and Official Opposition spokesperson for housing, Carole Poirier, and MNA for Rosemont and spokesperson for social services, Jean? François Lisée, ask the government to respect the commitments that have already been made for social housing and the fight against homelessness.
“The community is worried about the silence of the Couillard government and its lack of commitment to the development of community housing. The units intended for people experiencing homelessness and for families, announced by the Parti Québécois as part of the National Policy to Combat Homelessness, must come to fruition. The Couillard government has a duty to set the record straight for the thousands of people who are waiting for them. As cuts are emerging in social programs, we join our voice to all those calling for clear answers from the Liberals, ”said Carole Poirier.
The National Policy to Combat Homelessness, presented last February by the Parti Québécois government, contains several orientations that bear an ambitious, comprehensive, coherent and sustainable vision in order to prevent and combat homelessness.
“The Liberals have said nothing about the campaign against homelessness and, since taking office, the radio silence has continued. In anticipation of the budget and the tabling of an interdepartmental action plan, the Liberal government must indicate that it will be there. He is required to make clear commitments to fight against homelessness, ”said Jean-François Lisée for his part.
Remember that earlier this week, the official opposition questioned the Couillard government about funding the overall mission of community health and social services organizations, but received no response to its questions.
“It is unacceptable that the most vulnerable people in our society pay the price for the austerity advocated by the Couillard government. The community, homelessness and social housing sectors must get answers, ”concluded the deputies.
