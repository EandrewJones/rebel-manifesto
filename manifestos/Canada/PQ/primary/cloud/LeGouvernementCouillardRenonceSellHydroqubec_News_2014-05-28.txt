Quebec - After having kept the issue of the sale of Hydro-Quebec vague, the Liberal government finally heard reason and did an about-face. The Prime Minister has indeed confirmed that there will be no sale of assets by his government.
“The questions we asked forced the Premier to take a stand against the privatization of Hydro-Quebec. After having advocated a government of transparency, the Liberals seem rather to maintain indecision and confusion on important issues for Quebecers. As we have said, this privatization was a bad idea. Hydro-Québec is a symbol of our economic nationalism. It is a source of enrichment, it is an engine of economic development for the regions, ”declared the member for Marie-Victorin and official opposition spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Bernard. Drainville.
This political balloon was launched following the publication of the Expert Report on the State of Quebec&#39;s Public Finances, produced by economists Luc Godbout and Claude Montmarquette, proposing the privatization of the state corporation as a solution to the budget problem. . Since then, the Prime Minister had not closed the door to this possibility, even declaring that he wanted to submit the question to his future commissions on taxation and program review.
“Asked yesterday about the possibility of selling part of Hydro-Quebec&#39;s assets, the President of the Treasury Board, Martin Coiteux, said that everything was on the table. The Prime Minister was forced, today, to bring him to order, by finally rejecting this bad proposal. We have to keep coming back to get answers. Quebecers have the right to know what awaits them and what the plans of this government are, ”concluded the Member for Marie-Victorin.
