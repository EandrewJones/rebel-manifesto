Québec, May 3, 2016 - The member for Bourget and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois responsible for the Charter of the French language, Maka Kotto, believes that the announcement made today by the Liberal government regarding the language of &#39;posting is &quot;too little, too late&quot;.
“The announcements by the minister responsible for the Charter of the French language do not go far enough and are very late. The judgment of the Court of Appeal on the language of signage was issued a year ago already, and the recommendations were nevertheless very clear: if we want to guarantee commercial signage in French, we must legislate. Without an amendment to Law 101, challenges to the regulation will still be possible, and its application will remain subject to the goodwill of companies. A definitive solution must be found by incorporating new requirements into the law, ”said Maka Kotto.
“Our language and our culture must be priorities at all times for the Government of Quebec. However, French is under pressure in several areas. The situation of workers on ephemeral construction sites, like that of the CHUM, or the francization of newcomers, which is very incomplete, are just two examples among many others. All recent studies also show a decline in French as a language of work, particularly in Montreal. The Charter must be adapted to respond to this new reality, ”continued the Member for Bourget.
Remember that the Parti Québécois - notably through Bill 14, tabled under the government of Pauline Marois - has long proposed to strengthen the Charter of the French language, among other things by including companies with 26 to 49 employees and federally chartered companies. “The government must do more, act with more vigor and determination. Currently, the boat is taking water from all sides and its proposal, by simple regulatory means, is far from sufficient to plug the breach, ”concluded Maka Kotto.
