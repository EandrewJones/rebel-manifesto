Quebec - The member for Richelieu and official opposition spokesperson for seniors, Sylvain Rochon, and the member for Taillon and spokesperson for health and access to care, Diane Lamarre, ask the Minister of Health and Social Services, Gaétan Barrette, to give up imposing on people accommodated in CHSLDs an increase in the rate going beyond indexation.
“While our seniors are struggling to get one bath per week and quality meals in public accommodation centers, we learn that the Minister of Health will make them pay more for the same services, for the same accommodation. He must abandon this idea and work, instead, to improve the care and services that our seniors so badly need. But the Minister and his government have made a choice: to ask for more money from vulnerable people and seniors living in CHSLDs, ”said Sylvain Rochon.
“It was following questions that we asked him during the study of the estimates on Tuesday that the Minister of Health had to admit that an error had slipped into the documents submitted to parliamentarians concerning the Support for the autonomy of the elderly. Gaétan Barrette confirmed that the 2015-2016 budget includes a measure aimed at increasing the contribution of people accommodated in CHSLDs beyond inflation. Yet we did not hear him brag about it when the budget was tabled. The 37,000 people affected are mainly people over 65 or severely disabled. The minister does not guarantee them essential hygiene and food services, but he is ready to take millions more out of their pockets. I see, day after day, how distant this minister is from the population and insensitive to the problems that affect them on a daily basis, ”added Diane Lamarre.
