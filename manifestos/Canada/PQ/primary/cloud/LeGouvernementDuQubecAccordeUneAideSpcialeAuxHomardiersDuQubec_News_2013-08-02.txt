Quebec - The Member of Parliament for Îles-de-la-Madeleine and Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ms. Jeannine Richard, announces, on behalf of the Deputy Premier and Minister of Agriculture, of Fisheries and Food, Mr. François Gendron, special financial assistance intended to support the Quebec lobster fleet.
For more than five years, the lobster fishing industry has struggled with serious difficulties due to the low prices offered in the markets. This year, although the quantities landed remained stable in the Magdalen Islands and increased in the Gaspé, market prices fell again.
“The drop in prices offered, combined with the general increase in operating costs, is weakening our lobster fishing businesses. This industry is very important for the economy of eastern Quebec and this special assistance will be beneficial to allow certain financially vulnerable companies to breathe a little bit, ”said François Gendron.
The special financial assistance includes relief from principal payments on loans guaranteed by the Ministry and a subsidy in the form of reimbursement of business bait and fuel expenses, which could reach $ 5,000 per business.
“With the lobster fishing season this year, this much-anticipated help will be welcome. Lobster fishing is a major industry for us and our government gives it all the importance it deserves by implementing a special assistance measure, ”concluded Ms. Jeannine Richard, recalling in passing that there are more than 500 lobster fishermen in Quebec and that the value of landings was estimated at over $ 36 million in 2012.
