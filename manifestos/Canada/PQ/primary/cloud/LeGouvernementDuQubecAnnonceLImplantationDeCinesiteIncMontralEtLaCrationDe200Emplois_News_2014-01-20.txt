London - On the occasion of an economic mission to Europe, the Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, announced the establishment in Montreal of Cinesite Inc., a new company that will be responsible for the North American activities of the London-based Cinesite VFX, specialized in the production of visual effects and animations for cinema and television.
The new Cinesite studio in Montreal will create 200 jobs, and this number could reach 250 by 2018. The establishment of this studio will result in capital investments, by the company, of $ 6.7 M, and the payroll will be $ 42.4 million. Cinesite also plans to carry out R&amp;D activities in production techniques as well as activities in the creation of animated films. The Government of Quebec, through Investissement Quebec, is granting an interest-free loan of $ 1.2 million to Cinesite inc. for the realization of his project.
“I am proud that Cinesite chooses Quebec as a key partner in North America. The creation of sustainable jobs in Quebec is the priority of my government&#39;s Economic Policy. To achieve our objective of creating 43,000 quality jobs by 2017, we are supporting the realization of major economic projects, such as the establishment in Montreal of Cinesite Inc., which operates in a rapidly growing sector, that of visual effects. The metropolis will thus have in its ranks a strategic company for its film and television industry, and its video game sector; a company likely to attract more large-scale film shoots and multimedia productions to Quebec, ”said Pauline Marois.
