London - Premier of Quebec Pauline Marois announced during her visit to London the opening of a White Star Capital fund office in Montreal and the intention of the government of Quebec to invest USD 10 million there .
Already present in London and New York, the White Star Capital fund invests in seed and start-up companies in the information and communications technology (ICT) industry. The establishment of White Star in Montreal will promote the channeling of foreign capital to Quebec ICT companies and will help attract world-class companies to Quebec. This fund relies on an international network that can facilitate the inflow of foreign capital for Quebec companies. Those that will be financed by White Star will therefore be able to benefit from a better positioning on an international scale, which will be beneficial to our entire ICT sector.
“As evidenced by its importance in the 2013-2017 Industrial Policy, the Quebec ICT industry is a real economic engine for Quebec. It contributes to the influence of our expertise and our ability to innovate, all over the world. The White Star Capital fund is a privileged opportunity to promote the start-up of visionary and dynamic companies in this booming industry, ”said Pauline Marois.
