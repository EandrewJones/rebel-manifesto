Alma - The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Member of Parliament for Jonqui√®re, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, accompanied by the Minister responsible for Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, the Canadian Francophonie and Sovereignty Governance and Member of Parliament for Lac-Saint-Jean, Alexandre Cloutier, announced the government&#39;s desire to materialize the construction project of a new bypass for the Delisle and Isle-Maligne sectors in Alma.
For 2013-2015, the Ministry of Transport is planning investments estimated at between $ 2.5 million and $ 3 million, mainly for preparatory activities and to initiate acquisitions.
So far, the project has received a favorable orientation from the Office of public hearings on the environment, while the Commission for the protection of agricultural land in Quebec has given its authorization for the continuation of the project in the summer of 2012. L The final preliminary draft has been completed and the budget available in the 2013-2015 program will be used for the preparation of the final plans and specifications. &quot;I am very happy to reiterate my desire to move forward with this project and to allow the progress of the preparatory stages which will ensure, as quickly as possible, the start of work,&quot; said Minister Sylvain Gaudreault.
Given its cost, in excess of $ 40 million, the Isle-Maligne bypass project is subject to the [Framework policy on the governance of major public infrastructure projects [(http: // www. tresor.gouv.qc.ca/infrastructures-publiques/gouvernance-des-projets-dinfrastructure/). The development of the business case will begin this spring and should continue until winter 2014.
