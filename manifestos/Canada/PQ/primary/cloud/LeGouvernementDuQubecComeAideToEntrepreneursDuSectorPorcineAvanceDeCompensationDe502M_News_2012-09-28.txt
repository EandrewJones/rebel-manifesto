Lévis - The government of Quebec, in support of Quebec companies in the pork sector, is moving ahead of the payment of agricultural income stabilization insurance (ASRA) compensation. Thus, La Financière agricole will soon pay more than $ 50.2 million to nearly 1,100 pig and piglet producers benefiting from this program. This third advance represents a net compensation of $ 5.42 per pig and $ 67.73 per sow.
&quot;The government is taking concrete action to support and support Quebec pork producers who are currently working in a difficult context characterized by a significant increase in feed costs and a recent decrease in the market price,&quot; said the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr. François Gendron.
Remember that La Financière agricole pays compensation to producers when the average selling price of a product is lower than the stabilized income established according to the cost of production. La Financière agricole has already paid, last June, to pig and piglet producers a sum of $ 24.1 million as a first advance for the 2012 insurance year and $ 32.5 million in August. as a second advance. In total, $ 106 million will therefore have been paid to producers in the pork sector in recent months.
With outstanding loans reaching $ 4.4 billion and insured values of nearly $ 4.8 billion, La Financière agricole plays a leading role in the development of Quebec&#39;s agricultural and agrifood sector. To ensure the economic and financial stability of businesses, it provides them with quality products and services in terms of income protection and agricultural insurance, risk capital, as well as agricultural and forestry financing. To do this, it relies on a multidisciplinary team that works in a network of service centers and counters spread across Quebec.
