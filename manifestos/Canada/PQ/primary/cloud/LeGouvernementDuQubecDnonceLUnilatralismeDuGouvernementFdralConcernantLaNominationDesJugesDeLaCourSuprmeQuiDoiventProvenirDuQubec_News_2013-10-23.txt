Quebec - The Minister for Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, the Canadian Francophonie and Sovereignty Governance, Mr. Alexandre Cloutier, denounces the federal intention to unilaterally modify the provisions of the Supreme Court Act which relate to the appointment of the three judges of this Court which must come from Quebec.
&quot;After the Senate and the attack on Bill 99, the federal government arrogates to itself the right to modify, without consultation, provisions which lie at the heart of an asymmetry specific to Quebec and which reflect its distinct character&quot;, declared Minister Cloutier.
“Everyone knows that Quebec has always claimed to be a stakeholder in the process of appointing judges to the Supreme Court. Today, the federal government is acting unilaterally once again by amending the Supreme Court Act, thus affecting the process for appointing judges in Quebec, ”added Minister Cloutier.
&quot;If the federal government thinks it is doing useful work by addressing the Supreme Court, it could at least have had the courage to ask the question of the bilingualism of its judges,&quot; he added.
For his part, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Bertrand St-Arnaud, announces that he will intervene before the Supreme Court of Canada in the context of the reference concerning the appointment of Justice Marc Nadon.
The government will argue that the appointment of Judge Nadon does not comply with the provisions of the law which provide that at least three judges of the Court be appointed from among the judges of the Superior Court or the Court of Appeal of Quebec or from among the members of the Barreau du Québec. He will also argue that the federal Parliament cannot unilaterally legislate to amend the Supreme Court Act, as he proposes.
