Québec, July 9, 2014 - The member for Rousseau and official opposition critic for finance, Nicolas Marceau, finds the federal plan to create a Canadian securities commission unacceptable and calls on the government of Québec to challenge it in court.
The cooperative system promoted by the federal government and Ontario, far from simplifying the regulation of the financial sector, rather duplicates the real system of cooperation between the provinces, which already exists and which works very well.
“The federal project, in addition to encroaching on Quebec&#39;s jurisdiction, creates a double structure that would be nothing more than a waste of time and money for businesses. The Quebec government must immediately announce that it will challenge it in court, ”said Nicolas Marceau.
While announcing his project under the name of “Cooperative regime”, the federal Minister of Finance does not hide his true intentions by saying: “Today&#39;s agreement is an important step in the establishment of an organization. single national regulation ”. This clearly contravenes the judgment of the Supreme Court.
“While a majority of provinces prefer to maintain the passport in securities, the government of Quebec must act now to ensure that its jurisdictions are respected and send the message that the federal plan to concentrate the regulation of financial markets in Ontario will never be accepted. in Quebec and will not be able to move forward, ”concluded the member for Rousseau.
Remember that the securities sector is crucial for the economy of Montreal and Quebec as a whole. The financial sector is made up of 3,000 companies in Montreal, 154,000 jobs in Quebec, including 100,000 in Montreal, which is the 16th largest financial center in the world. That&#39;s 6% of Quebec&#39;s GDP.
