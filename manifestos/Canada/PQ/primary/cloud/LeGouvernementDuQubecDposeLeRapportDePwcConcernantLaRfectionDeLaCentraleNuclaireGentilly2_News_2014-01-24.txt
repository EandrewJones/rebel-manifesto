Quebec - The Minister of Natural Resources, Martine Ouellet, makes public, following the settlement between Hydro-Quebec and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report concerning the refurbishment of the Gentilly-2 nuclear power plant.
PwC&#39;s mandate was to carry out an audit relating to the suspension of repair work on the Gentilly-2 power station by Hydro-Québec given that the accounting firms had deemed it to be outside their field of competence. to verify the &quot;actions of the former government and of Hydro-Quebec&quot; in the absence of objective criteria on which to base oneself.
The costs capitalized as an investment for the refurbishment of the Gentilly-2 generating station, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008, totaled $ 988 million. During its examination, PwC did not find anything which would lead it to believe that the statement of the costs recognized as an investment for the refurbishment of the Gentilly-2 power station is not in conformity, in all material respects, Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.
