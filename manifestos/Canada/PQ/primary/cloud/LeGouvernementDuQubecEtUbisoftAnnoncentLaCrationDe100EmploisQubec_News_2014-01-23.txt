Davos - Quebec Premier Pauline Marois today announced the expansion of the Ubisoft Divertissements inc. Studio. in Quebec. The expansion of this studio will create 100 jobs. The Government of Quebec has granted a non-refundable financial contribution of $ 510,000 to Ubisoft Divertissements inc. for this project, amounting to $ 28.7 million over three years.
“My government&#39;s obsession since being elected has been to create quality jobs in all regions. In recent years, Quebec has become a global hub for video game development, with nearly 90 studios and approximately 8,300 jobs. Our competitive business environment, our pool of qualified and creative labor, our strategic infrastructures, such as specialized training centers and lower operating costs than elsewhere, are all advantages for companies that settle with us. We are proud to participate in the growth of a strategic sector for our economy, ”said the Premier.
Ubisoft&#39;s project will allow the Quebec City studio to acquire a state-of-the-art infrastructure and an environment conducive to the creation of large-scale games on new generation consoles. The field of video games is currently going through a period of transition with the proliferation of platforms, the arrival of digital distribution as well as the increased importance of social networks and connectivity. To adapt to this new reality, game studios must review their production methods.
“With our investment and the help of the government, our studio in Quebec will become a class AAA studio. We are thus continuing to build the expertise that allows us to create the best games in the industry, ”said Yves Guillemot, co-founder and CEO of Ubisoft.
