“In the current context of an energy surplus, Hydro-Québec will save $ 24 million each year thanks to this decision. It is therefore all Quebecers who will be the winners by avoiding significant losses, ”declared Ms. Martine Ouellet.
The end of this program will result in the abandonment of six projects of small hydroelectric power stations whose stages of realization are at a preliminary stage. &quot;The government will quickly begin discussions with the promoters concerned in order to determine the appropriate compensation based on the progress of the projects and the expenditures made,&quot; explained Ms. Ouellet.
The government also intends to consult the municipalities and communities concerned in order to find solutions to support structuring projects likely to promote their economic development.
An interministerial committee, under the supervision of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, is set up. &quot;The committee&#39;s mandate is to work in collaboration with the affected communities to determine the structuring socio-economic development projects to be developed in the short term,&quot; said Mr. Gaudreault.
“The government is aware that this decision will have repercussions on the affected Indigenous communities. I will make sure to enter into a constructive dialogue in order to find satisfactory solutions for all, ”said the Minister for Native Affairs, Ms. Élizabeth Larouche.
“As a new government, we have a duty to manage the transition. In addition to obvious economic considerations, we also decided in favor of the preservation of several natural environments without renouncing a desire for regional development. Our energy future depends on this convergence between the economy and the environment with a view to sustainable development, ”concluded the Minister of Sustainable Development, the Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet.
