Quebec - The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr. François Gendron, is pleased to announce the allocation of financial assistance of $ 3,326,400, over a period of four years on the Quebec Agri-Food Promotion Council, better known as Aliments du Québec. Thanks to this sum, the organization will be able to pursue its mission, namely to carry out promotional and awareness-raising initiatives with a view to increasing the market share of Québec food products on the domestic market.
“The Food Sovereignty Policy places great emphasis on showcasing local products and aims in particular to support the development of Quebec&#39;s offer by focusing on its particularities and distinctive character. In this regard, Aliments du Québec is doing remarkable work and contributing to the realization of this major project, ”said the Minister.
The announced financial assistance will allow the organization to continue to expand the notoriety of its “Aliments du Québec” and “Aliments Prepared in Quebec” labels and their “Organic” versions. Today, more than 16,500 products display these logos, compared to 5,000 just a few years ago.
&quot;This organization is a key partner of the&quot; Aliments du Québec: Always the Right Choice! &quot; that the Ministry leads. We must continue our work so that local products are even more easily accessible and identifiable for consumers, ”concluded François Gendron.
