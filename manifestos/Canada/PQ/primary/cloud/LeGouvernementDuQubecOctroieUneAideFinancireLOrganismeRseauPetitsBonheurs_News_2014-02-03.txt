“Since its inception, the Petits bonheurs Network has offered culture as a means of social integration and development of young children by exploring the world of creation. The shows intended for toddlers have a special character because, by nurturing their imagination, they fuel their creativity and develop their taste for attending the arts, ”said Maka Kotto.
“By observing the illuminated gaze of the very young spectators, we understand that it is essential to increase the offer of cultural activities specific to early childhood. By being committed to increasing the number of opportunities to make the performing arts accessible to young people from economically fragile backgrounds, the Petits Bonheurs Network is spreading where it matters, ”said Carole Poirier.
The network currently has 15 members spread across a few regions of Quebec, among multidisciplinary presenters specializing in shows and artistic performances intended for early childhood. The objective of the organization is to develop its component concerning networking in order to promote its expansion across Quebec, to reach more toddlers in regions with little or no current service, especially fragile economic environments.
The financial assistance of $ 75,000 announced by the Ministry of Culture and Communications will breathe new life into the organization by promoting the deployment of cultural activities and access to them for young people.
