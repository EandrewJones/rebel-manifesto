To do this, the Government of Quebec is hiring four experts in the field of municipal affairs as well as health and social services.
“More than ever, the government of Quebec is confronted with the disorderly interventions of the federal government in the exclusive competences of Quebec. It is clear that the federal government is pursuing the same paternalistic and domineering federalism that it nevertheless strongly condemned in the speech of Quebec in 2005. After having put Quebec&#39;s public finances in order, we are now tackling duplication. and interference from Ottawa, in order to make the state more efficient and save Quebecers money. We want to ensure that they stop paying double for services that are the sole responsibility of the Government of Quebec, ”said Minister Alexandre Cloutier.
