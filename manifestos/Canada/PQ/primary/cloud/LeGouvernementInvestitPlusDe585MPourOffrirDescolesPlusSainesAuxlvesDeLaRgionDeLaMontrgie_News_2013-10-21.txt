La Prairie - Accompanied by the Member for Sanguinet and Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Alain Therrien, the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports, Mrs. Marie Malavoy, announced today that the government would accelerate investments of $ 58,534,050 in the region&#39;s school boards to provide students with healthier learning environments. These investments will make it possible to carry out improvement, renovation and repair projects in more than 160 schools to prevent possible air quality problems.
The sums announced, details of which can be found in the appendix, will be distributed among the 13 school boards in the region. Various corrective works will be carried out, from the replacement of plumbing, through the repair of roofs, doors and windows, to that of the exterior envelope and the structure of the buildings. This preventive work will ensure a safe environment for students, teachers and school staff.
“Faced with the air quality problems experienced by some schools, the government has chosen the only possible path: action. We had to do everything we could to meet the most pressing needs and act upstream on existing infrastructures. This is what we are doing through these massive investments in our educational heritage, ”declared Minister Malavoy.
Among the planned investments, let us mention an envelope of $ 525,000 intended to settle known cases of contamination in the Saint-Jean and Langlois schools of the Commission scolaire de la Vallée-des-Tisserands.
