Quebec - The leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of economy, energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, as well as the spokesperson for finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, ask the government to unveil its game plan for the aviation industry.
“There has been a succession of job losses for two years, whether at CAE, Bombardier or Bell Helicopter, as we saw yesterday. What is the government doing to stop this hemorrhage affecting such a critical sector? “, Wanted to know the leader of the official opposition.
In terms of value, aircraft are Quebec&#39;s main export products. “Bombardier cut 1000 jobs in Montreal, CAE, 280, and here it is, yesterday, Bell Helicopter announced the cut of 300 additional jobs. For this plant alone, 1,000 jobs out of 2,000 have been lost over the past 5 years. The absence of a government plan means that the sector cannot make any forecasts. What are the Liberals waiting for to act? “, For his part asked Alain Therrien.
“The government has put all its marbles in a bad deal with Bombardier. And, since then, he&#39;s been acting like it&#39;s all settled, as job losses mount and CSeries sales stagnate. Concern is generalized in the aeronautics sector. The government is incapable of reassuring industry players and helping them properly, ”Nicolas Marceau continued.
“Already that the Prime Minister had no plan of economic development or creation of jobs, his about-face in the Anticosti file created a climate of economic uncertainty. Investors are afraid to come to Quebec and put up with the Prime Minister&#39;s mood. Quebec needs a clear vision. Where is this government going? This is the question everyone is asking, ”concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
