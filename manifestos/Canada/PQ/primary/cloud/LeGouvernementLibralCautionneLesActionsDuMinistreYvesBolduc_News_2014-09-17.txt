Quebec - The member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for ethics and integrity, Stéphane Bergeron, denounces the Liberal government, which once again endorsed the actions of the Minister of Education and Recreation and Sport, Yves Bolduc. The Liberal MPs voted against a motion asking the minister to reimburse in full his bonus of $ 215,000.
The motion reads as follows:
“That the National Assembly demand that the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports immediately reimburse the entire premium of $ 215,000 he received in addition to his fee-for-service and his MP salary following his return to medical practice in September 2012. ”
“This issue should be settled for several months. Minister Bolduc should have understood from the start that his action was unacceptable. The amount of $ 215,000 must be fully reimbursed. If the government wants to be credible in the austerity measures it is proposing to Quebeckers, the minister must set an example and reimburse his premium in full. Transparency and integrity in the management of public funds were abandoned this afternoon by the Liberal government, ”said Stéphane Bergeron.
“Among the 5,400 physicians who received bonuses, only 14 received a bonus of more than $ 200,000 under this measure. And, of these 14 doctors, there is Minister Bolduc. However, he said he practiced medicine &quot;very part time&quot;. The purpose of this measure was to give a family doctor to people and families who did not have one. It was a question of complete and long-term care, not just one-off care. The minister hijacked the bonus target by cashing in over $ 215,000. He himself signed the agreement creating this bonus and he knew of a flaw that he did not hesitate to exploit, a flaw that we corrected while we were in government, ”concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
