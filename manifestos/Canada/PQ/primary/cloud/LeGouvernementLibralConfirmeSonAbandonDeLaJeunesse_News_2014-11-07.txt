Québec, November 7, 2014 - In the presence of dozens of young people and stakeholders concerned by the fate of carrefours jeunesse-emploi (CJE), the member for Saint-Jean and official opposition spokesperson for employment , vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, today called on the National Assembly, the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, François Blais, about the change of mission of the CJE .
“Before making a final decision in this matter, the Minister would do well to go and see what is going on in the CJEs up close,” said Dave Turcotte. Especially since the CJE Charlesbourg-Chauveau is located in the same building as its constituency office! &quot;
The member insists that it is not the structures that are being attacked by the Liberal government; these are the young people that the CJEs support every day in their process of accessing employment. &quot;With the loss of 82,000 full-time jobs since last April, we cannot afford to deprive ourselves of expertise and employment support in our regions,&quot; he continued.
The MP also points out that the changes made will have an impact on many young people who use the services offered by the CJEs. “With the reform of Minister François Blais, young people under the age of 18 will no longer have access to CJEs, nor those who are not recipients of social assistance or employment insurance. For example, young people in precarious employment and wishing to reorient their careers would not have access to the services of the CJEs. Of the 60,000 young people who currently receive support from the CJEs, 40,000 will no longer be eligible; it is inconceivable! », Concluded Dave Turcotte.
