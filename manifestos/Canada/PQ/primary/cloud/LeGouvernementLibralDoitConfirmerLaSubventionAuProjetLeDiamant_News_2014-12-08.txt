Quebec - The MNA for Joliette and official opposition critic for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, and the MNA for Taschereau and parliamentary leader, Agnès Maltais, deplore the possible cancellation of the grant to the theater project Le Diamond, by Robert Lepage, which would be another break in the electoral promise of Prime Minister Philippe Couillard.
“If the cancellation of the subsidy turns out, it will be another example of this government&#39;s blatant lack of consideration for culture. Liberal austerity has resulted in a significant reduction in tax credits for cultural production and record cuts in state museums, not to mention that consideration has been given to closing the conservatories, a scenario on which the government has decided. finally backed down in the face of our pressures and the mobilization in the affected regions, ”declared Véronique Hivon.
“The Minister of Culture, Hélène David, has abandoned Quebec culture. It must call its government to order and fight to preserve the resources dedicated to our culture; this sector, which represents more than 4% of Québec&#39;s GDP, is of real economic importance. Investing in culture is also and above all a real investment in us, in our talent and in our creativity. This government must stop tackling it, ”she added.
The Member for Taschereau recalls for her part that the Prime Minister had promised, during the election campaign, to go ahead with the financing of the Le Diamant project, announced by Christine St-Pierre in 2012. Asked about this last June , the Minister responsible for the Capitale-Nationale region, Sam Hamad, had also confirmed that the money would be there. “Le Diamant is a major cultural development project for the Capitale-Nationale; it will contribute to the influence of our city, here and abroad. The government must back down and confirm funding for this project. The uncertainty is unacceptable, and it must end immediately, ”concluded Agnès Maltais.
