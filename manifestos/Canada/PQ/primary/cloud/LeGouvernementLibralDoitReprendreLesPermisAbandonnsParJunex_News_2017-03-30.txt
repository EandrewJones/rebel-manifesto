Quebec, March 30, 2017 - While the company Junex abandons 34 permits, representing a total area of 6,700 km2 in the regions of the Capitale? Nationale, Chaudière? Appalaches, Estrie and Mauricie, the chief of the official opposition, Jean-François Lisée, and the Parti Québécois spokesperson for energy, Sylvain Rochon, are asking the Liberal government not to put them back on the market. Having tabled a motion to this effect, they deeply regret that the government and the CAQ have rejected it.
IN SHORT
“It&#39;s time to put the plug on the possibility of shale gas exploitation in these regions, as everywhere in Quebec. It costs nothing to put abandoned permits back on the market for an indefinite period. In addition, it is much better to recover them when they are voluntarily abandoned by a company. The Liberal government must send a message, ”insisted Jean-François Lisée.
“We fought with all our might, as part of the study of Bill 106, for the government to ban fracking, a hated technique used to extract shale gas. He stubbornly refused to do so, announcing instead a framework in regulations which had not yet appeared at that date. Today, he missed another great opportunity to show that he is sensitive to the concerns of Quebecers. We will continue to be their voice, as resolutely as the government is that of oil and gas, ”for his part assured Sylvain Rochon.
Wording of the motion without notice rejected by the Liberals and the CAQ
“That the National Assembly take note of the decision of the Junex company to renounce 34 hydrocarbon exploration permits in the lowlands of the St. Lawrence covering an area of nearly 6,700 km2;
That the National Assembly ask the government of Quebec to keep these 34 permits and to exempt the territories concerned from all shale gas exploitation. &quot;
