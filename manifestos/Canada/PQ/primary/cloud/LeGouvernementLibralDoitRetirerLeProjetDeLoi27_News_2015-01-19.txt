Quebec - The member for Terrebonne and spokesperson for the official opposition in family matters, Mathieu Traversy, calls on the Minister of Families, Francine Charbonneau, to completely abandon the idea of fining Quebec parents and calls for the immediate withdrawal of Bill 27.
“The groups heard in parliamentary committee confirmed what we said from the start: this bill is improvised and does not respond to the problem of so-called phantom places. What the government must do is withdraw its botched bill and quickly propose solutions to the real problems, namely the scarcity of places and the lack of flexibility in the offer of childcare services. Families in Quebec need accessible and flexible places, that is, part-time or atypical hours, evenings or weekends. The solutions exist; the Minister must therefore step back on the sanctions that she wants to impose on parents and accelerate the development of places, which she herself has slowed down, ”said Mathieu Traversy.
In addition, the member for Terrebonne invites the minister to reconnect with his network. “The Worksite on the Quality and Sustainability of Childcare Services and the Optimization of Their Funding, chaired by Maurice Boisvert and set up by the Parti Québécois government, targeted various problems with which the network is grappling. Its report was tabled in December 2013, but the current government has not followed up on it. I ask Minister Charbonneau to re-establish dialogue with the network by creating a committee to monitor the Boisvert report, in order to think about real solutions. It must listen to the partners on the ground, because they know the environment and they are ready to work to provide effective and lasting solutions, ”concluded the deputy.
