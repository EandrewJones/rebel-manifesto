Quebec - The member for Taschereau and official opposition spokesperson for health, Agnès Maltais, accuses the liberal regime of embezzling taxpayers&#39; money to boost Jean Charest&#39;s image campaign and his marketing plan for North.
The member protested that an internal note from a senior official of the Ministry of Health and Social Services, recently sent to the directors of public health of Quebec, specifies that the government of Quebec will be unable to meet the usual obligations in this regard. which relates to the communication campaigns in prevention of sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBI) this year, citing &quot;financial reasons&quot;.
“The mandate of a government is to promote healthy living practices to prevent disease. What this note tells us is that the Liberal government, exceptionally this year, does not intend to honor its mandate for financial reasons. To see Jean Charest spending millions of dollars these days, he will have to find a better explanation, ”said Agnès Maltais.
She recalls that every year, 40,000 Quebeckers are diagnosed with an STBBI. In the 4th national report on the state of health of the population of Quebec tabled in 2010, it is specified that STBBIs represent a silent epidemic and &quot;that today it is imperative to mobilize again, individually and collectively to fight against this STBBI epidemic because the long-term consequences can be serious ”resulting in“ economic and social costs ”.
The member for Taschereau accuses Minister Yves Bolduc of not having taken out insurance to protect the funds intended to finance, as every year, a communication campaign in the prevention of STBBI. “In recent weeks, taxpayers have witnessed an orgy of advertising to see Jean Charest and his marketing plan for the North. Where were the budget constraints? It is an embezzlement that we are witnessing, behind closed doors. Yves Bolduc must remedy this now, ”concluded Agnès Maltais.
