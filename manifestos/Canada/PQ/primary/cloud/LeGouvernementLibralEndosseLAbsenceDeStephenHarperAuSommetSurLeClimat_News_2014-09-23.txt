Quebec - Sylvain Gaudreault, the member for Jonquière and official opposition critic for the environment and sustainable development, observes that the Liberal government cannot stand up to the federal government, since it refused to support a motion condemning the absence of Stephen Harper at the UN climate summit.
“In New York, Philippe Couillard refuses to comment on the absence of Stephen Harper. The Liberals are unable to ensure that Quebec unanimously denounces the absence of the federal government at a global table on climate change. They don&#39;t want to criticize Ottawa; the liberal floundering continues, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
The motion defeated by the Liberals reads as follows:
“That the National Assembly denounce the absence of the Prime Minister of Canada at the United Nations climate summit in New York;
That the National Assembly mark the March on the climate held in some twenty Quebec cities, where thousands of citizens reiterated the need for economic development compatible with the protection of the environment. &quot;
