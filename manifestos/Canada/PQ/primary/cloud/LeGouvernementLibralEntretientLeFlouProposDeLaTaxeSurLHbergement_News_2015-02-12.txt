Quebec - The member for Bertrand and official opposition critic for tourism, Claude Cousineau, as well as the member for Abitibi-Ouest, François Gendron, denounce the vagueness the government maintains on the subject of the accommodation, while some players in the tourism industry claim that it wants to deprive the regions of the resulting budgets.
“As if our regions were not already severely affected by the Prime Minister&#39;s austerity policy, we learned this morning, through the voice of tourism stakeholders in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, that the government is juggling idea of centralizing accommodation tax budgets. If that turns out, we can say that the Minister of Tourism is setting fire to the powder in the industry, ”said Claude Cousineau.
The deputy recalls that since 1997, the regional tourist associations (ATR) decide for themselves on the use they make of the budgets coming from the tax on lodging. ATRs know their environment and their stakeholders; they therefore know how to improve the tourism offer in their region and promote it.
“In the House this morning, the Minister responsible for the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, Luc Blanchette, did not even intervene to reassure the tourist community back home. The concerns of stakeholders are understandable, since no one among the Liberals has denied the centralization scenario. The government must step back on this harmful idea for regional tourism development, ”concluded François Gendron.
