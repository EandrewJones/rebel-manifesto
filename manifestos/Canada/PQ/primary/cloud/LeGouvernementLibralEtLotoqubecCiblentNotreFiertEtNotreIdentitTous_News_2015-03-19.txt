Québec– The member for Labelle and official opposition spokesperson for recreation and sports, Sylvain Pagé, and the member for Joliette and spokesperson for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, denounce the half of the funding that Loto-Québec allocates to the national holiday, which is in addition to the 20% cut in its budget by the government.
Loto-Québec even affirmed, through the voice of its spokesperson, that the national holiday is not a promising activity for the state corporation, because it &quot;does not have sufficient economic and tourist influence to justify the &#39;injection of funds&#39;. For the Parti Québécois, this vision reduces the unifying significance of the national holiday of Quebecers, the events of which underline our pride, our culture and our identity.
“Loto-Québec&#39;s declaration and gesture are unacceptable. We ask that the Crown corporation immediately withdraw its comments, that it consider the fair value of the contribution of the national holiday and that it understand that our holiday should never be cashed in, ”declared Sylvain Pagé.
The Parti Québécois reiterates the importance of the national holiday for our cultural identity. “It is a pivotal moment of the year when all Quebecers, regardless of their origins, celebrate their belonging to a common society. The government and Loto-Québec must reverse their decision and restore the budgets provided for this event, ”added Véronique Hivon.
