Quebec City, November 5, 2014 - Stéphane Bédard, MP for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, and Mathieu Traversy, MP for Terrebonne and Family Critic, denounce the Liberal government&#39;s relentlessness on Quebec families . “Never have Quebec families been attacked so directly. Philippe Couillard, during the election campaign, denounced a potential tariff shock for middle-class families; he never spoke of the family tax which he now intends to impose. The Liberals said they were against a $ 1 increase in tariffs and, once in power, they think it is okay to impose a $ 5 increase! It is not the better off who will pay for this measure; it is the families of the middle class, who are already struggling to make ends meet, ”denounced Stéphane Bédard. As for the member for Terrebonne, he points out that the Minister of Families, Francine Charbonneau, has still not denied that she intended to further tax middle-class families by adjusting the rates according to income. “The minister says everything is still on the table. However, today we see that his idea is made and that families will pay more. She also says that the many scenarios examined are constantly evolving. The truth is, she is not in control except with the intention of making families pay. To attack the universality of tariffs in daycare services by ideology is to attack equal opportunities and the very essence of the network created 15 years ago. I remind him that child care services are an investment, not an expense, &quot;added Mathieu Traversy.&quot; Let us not forget that the government of Ottawa, for its part, has just increased federal tax credits. for day care services. However, families in Quebec do not benefit from it, because of the existence of our network. And what is Philippe Couillard&#39;s government doing to remedy this problem? It steals from the pockets of families who are already overtaxed, ”concluded Stéphane Bédard.
