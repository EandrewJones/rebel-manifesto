Quebec - The member for Berthier and official opposition critic for agriculture, André Villeneuve, denounces the $ 113 million cut made by the Liberal government in the budget of La Financière agricole.
“La Financière is farmers&#39; woolen socks for tough years; it is only beginning to recover from the deficits of recent years. The 2014-2015 budget year was to be the one where La Financière put its deficit behind it. And it is now that Minister Pierre Paradis decides to give the government a contribution holiday, claiming that there is enough money in the coffers. This is unacceptable; the government is making farmers pay the price for its austerity policies, ”said André Villeneuve.
The MP points out that in the event of a difficult year, the underfunding of La Financière could result in a return to the enormous accumulated deficits, as we saw in 2010, where they exceeded $ 500 million.
“With municipal pension plans, today we see what happens when we draw from the surpluses and give ourselves contribution holidays. When the hard years return, the coffers are already empty. The agriculture sector creates wealth and helps stimulate the economy. Once again, the government is focusing on the expenditure column instead of having an economic plan to increase revenues and stimulate job creation, ”concluded André Villeneuve.
