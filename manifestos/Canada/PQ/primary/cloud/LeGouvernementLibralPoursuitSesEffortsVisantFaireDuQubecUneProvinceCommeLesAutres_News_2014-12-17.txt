Quebec - Stéphane Bergeron, MP for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, strongly deplores the Liberal government&#39;s decision, announced quietly in the run-up to the holidays, to close the Quebec Office in Ottawa and the Quebec branch in Vancouver.
“The Liberal government has already completely given up on the federal government. The Prime Minister lets Ottawa decide what happens in our territory, particularly in terms of the environment and with regard to federal health transfers. How can we ensure that Quebec&#39;s voice and interests are heard in the capital of Canada if Quebec is no longer there? Philippe Couillard is continuing his great march towards his sole objective: to make Quebec a province like any other, ”declared Stéphane Bergeron.
However, Quebec has been present in Ottawa since 1908 to look after its interests in the federal capital. In 1984, it consolidated its presence there by establishing the Bureau du Québec in Ottawa, as we know it today. “In his efforts to trivialize Quebec, Philippe Couillard breaks with the traditional policy of our national government; the closure of the Quebec Office in Ottawa is eloquent illustration of this, ”added the member for Verchères.
Equally incomprehensible and potentially damaging is the decision to close our branch in Vancouver. “Each year, Quebec exports $ 5 billion in products and services to British Columbia. These important exchanges will now be managed from Toronto. However, to improve them, the presence on the ground and close to the companies on site is essential. The closure of the Quebec branch in Vancouver is nonsense, ”concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
