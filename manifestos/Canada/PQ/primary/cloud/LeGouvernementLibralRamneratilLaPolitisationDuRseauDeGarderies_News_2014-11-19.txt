Quebec - The member for Terrebonne and official opposition critic for family matters, Mathieu Traversy, is concerned that the government, by considering the conversion of non-subsidized spaces into subsidized spaces, is going back to the era of politicization of the allocation of places, at the source of the scandal of liberal daycare centers.
“The conversion will have the same consequences as what the Auditor General&#39;s report denounced in the wake of the liberal daycare scandal: a disorderly and subjective development. Should we understand from the will of the Minister, who intends to promote private daycares, that she will eliminate the transparent selection of projects, through regional selection committees, and bring back the politicization of the network, such as at the time of Tony Tomassi? “Asked Mathieu Traversy.
The member recalls the remarks that Minister Francine Charbonneau made last June, during the study of the budget appropriations; she said then against conversion, since this process did not create any new place: &quot;I am not creating any more, I am only accommodating people who have opened day care centers&quot;, she declared.
“This summer, the minister was against conversion. Today she is in favor. Who convinced her to change her mind? The president of the Coalition of non-subsidized private daycare centers in Quebec and ex-candidate of the PLQ in Blainville? Non-subsidized private daycares are mostly located in the metropolitan area; What does the Minister say to childcare services in underprivileged areas or in all the other regions of Quebec, which had received their confirmation for new places and which saw their project halted? », Concluded the member for Terrebonne.
