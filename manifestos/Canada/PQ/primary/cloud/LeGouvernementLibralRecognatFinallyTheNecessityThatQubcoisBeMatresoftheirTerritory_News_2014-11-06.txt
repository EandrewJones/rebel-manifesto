Québec, November 6, 2014 - Sylvain Gaudreault, the member for Jonquière and official opposition critic for the environment and sustainable development, is delighted that the government, like all political parties, has recognized the importance, for Quebecers, of being masters of their territory from an environmental standpoint. “Thanks to the Parti Québécois and our actions, the government first accepted the BAPE for the entire Energy East pipeline project. He finally admits today, like the other parties represented in the National Assembly, that Energy East&#39;s overall contribution to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions must be included in the BAPE, which will assess the whole. of the impacts of this project, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault. The government must now walk the talk, assume its jurisdiction over the environment and stop delegating its environmental assessments to the National Energy Board. “The government of Quebec finally recognizes that the BAPE is the only credible organization to assess the environmental impacts of the Energy East project. As for what follows, it is very clear: the National Energy Board is an organization that no longer has the necessary credibility to make a decision on behalf of Quebecers, ”concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
