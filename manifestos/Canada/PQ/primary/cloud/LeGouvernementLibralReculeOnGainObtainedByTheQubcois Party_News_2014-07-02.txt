Québec, July 2, 2014 - André Villeneuve, the member for Berthier and official opposition critic for agriculture, fisheries and food, tabled today during the consideration of supply budget from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPAQ), a letter from the Federal Minister of International Trade, Ed Fast. Dated October 16, 2013, this letter indicates that his government will compensate dairy producers, before the ratification by the National Assembly of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union.
“The government is backing down not only on a request made by the Parti Québécois government, but also on a gain that we had obtained. Even the federal government agreed that it was necessary to adequately compensate dairy and cheese producers before the National Assembly ratified the agreement, ”declared André Villeneuve.
Remember that according to CETA, more than 17,700 additional tonnes of European cheese will enter the Canadian and Quebec markets. The shortfall of Quebec producers must therefore be compensated.
“It is essential that the government come to its senses and support our producers, so that they receive full compensation. Minister Pierre Paradis continued to deny his responsibilities today during the consideration of supply. What we understand from his words is that he is definitely throwing in the towel, and that is unacceptable, ”concluded the member for Berthier.
