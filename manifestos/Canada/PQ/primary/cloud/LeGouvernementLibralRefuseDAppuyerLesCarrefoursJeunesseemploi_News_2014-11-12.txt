Quebec - The member for Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, deplores that the government missed the opportunity today , to reconsider its decision to change the mission of the carrefours jeunesse-emploi (CJE). He refused to consent to a motion to this effect tabled by the member of the Parti Québécois.
“The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, François Blais, has had several occasions to step back and listen to reason. He refuses to do it. Helping young people who have the most difficulty integrating into the job market, we agree. But why abandon all the others who use the services of CJEs in all regions of Quebec? Why abandon an effective tool for the socio-economic development of the regions? »Asked Dave Turcotte.
The motion, rejected by the Liberals, asked the Quebec government to preserve the current mission of carrefours jeunesse-emploi by maintaining the possibility for all young people aged 16 to 35 to use the services of their carrefour jeunesse-emploi, and to maintain funding. linked to the mission of the youth employment centers.
“Young people and workers are mobilizing all over Quebec to maintain the mission and resources of the CJEs. The testimonies accumulate, but the government remains deaf to these thousands of young people who were able to obtain support, to walk and to get by thanks to the CJE. When will the government back down? Added the member for Saint-Jean.
