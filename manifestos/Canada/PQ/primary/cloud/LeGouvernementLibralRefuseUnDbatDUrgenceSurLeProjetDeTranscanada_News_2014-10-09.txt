Quebec - Sylvain Gaudreault, the member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and the environment, denounces the Liberal Party&#39;s refusal to hold an emergency debate in the National Assembly on the draft TransCanada in Gros-Cacouna, despite the fact that drilling will resume on October 16 and the National Assembly will not be sitting by then.
This refusal by the government and the silence of the Coalition Avenir Québec on this subject are unacceptable. Remember that six environmental groups are also calling for an emergency debate to be held in the National Assembly. The Parti Québécois therefore asks David Heurtel to assume his responsibilities and act as a true Minister of the Environment for Quebec. “Drilling work must be suspended immediately. If drilling, even exploratory, endanger an endangered species, it is because it simply should not take place! The Minister refuses to see this evidence, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
The member also insists on the request for an independent investigation that he made last week, and today in parliamentary committee, concerning the granting of the certificate of authorization to TransCanada. The government still refuses to launch this investigation.
“The Liberals do not want to shed light, preferring the omerta among civil servants. This intimidation on their part is very worrying. We need to know what happened. The authorization certificate was issued in contravention of all the rules, in particular without scientific advice. By choosing to comply with TransCanada&#39;s demands, the government has lost a good opportunity to act in the public interest. Common sense and transparency have clearly disappeared from the Liberal radar screen, to the detriment of the interests of citizens and the preservation of our environment, ”concluded the member for Jonquière.
