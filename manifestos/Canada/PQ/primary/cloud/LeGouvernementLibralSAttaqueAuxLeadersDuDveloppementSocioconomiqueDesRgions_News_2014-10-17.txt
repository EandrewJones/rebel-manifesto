Québec, October 17, 2014 - Gaétan Lelièvre, the member for Gaspé and official opposition spokesperson for municipal affairs and regional development, and the member for Saint-Jérôme and spokesperson for economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, join their voice to that of the many elected officials and local stakeholders who ask the liberal government to be clear and transparent with the local development centers (CLD), tools essential to the economy of the regions of Quebec.
This week, the Liberal MP for Abitibi-Est, Guy Bourgeois, pointed out that the CLD remodeling would surely take place over the next year. “The government has already cut 8 million in CLD activities. Liberal deputies and ministers are now looming over the threat of a reorganization of the administration and the mission of the CLDs. This &quot;remodeling&quot; is done without any consultation with the main stakeholders. The Liberals are once again proving that the economic and social development of the regions is not a priority for them. Behind the great speeches in support of municipalities, RCMs and regions, we see that liberal austerity measures are damaging to them, ”declared Gaétan Lelièvre.
According to the deputy, CLDs are the most able to identify promising sectors for local development. They support communities and entrepreneurs for business start-ups and the development of promising projects.
The member for Saint-Jérôme adds that the Liberal government&#39;s austerity measures are detrimental to socio-economic development and job creation, everywhere in Quebec.
“The liberal effect means job losses and economic stagnation. Over 50,000 full-time jobs have been lost since the Liberals came to power. The government focuses on spending, without affecting state revenues. Developing the regions, by supporting CLDs, is essential. The government must be clear with these organizations, instead of allowing concerns to grow, ”concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
