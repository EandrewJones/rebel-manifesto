Quebec - The Minister responsible for Government Administration and President of the Treasury Board, Mr. Stéphane Bédard, confirmed that a government decree was adopted on October 23 to make certain categories of City of Montreal contracts subject to the authorization process for Law no. 1. This decree will be published in the Gazette officielle du Québecdemain.
Thus, companies wishing to enter into contracts with the City of Montreal for construction, reconstruction, demolition, repair or renovation in terms of roads, water or sewer systems for an amount equal to or greater than 100 $ 000 as well as companies wishing to enter into sub-contracts of the same nature directly or indirectly linked to these contracts and involving an expenditure equal to or greater than $ 25,000, must obtain a contract authorization issued by the Autorité des marchés financiers.
“With this decree, the government wants to strengthen the application of Law 1 in Montreal while reducing the processing times for files. The City of Montreal will be able to launch its calls for tenders with the assurance that the contracts will be awarded to companies with integrity that deserve the trust of citizens, ”declared Minister Bédard.
Remember that the Integrity Act in Public Contracts provides for measures to respond to specific issues such as those of the City of Montreal. It gives the government the power to determine by decree progressively the groups of public contracts or subcontracts to come or in progress requiring prior authorization to contract.
The Autorité des marchés financiers makes available on the website www.lautorite.qc.cales the documents required to submit an authorization request. For Quebec businesses, authorization requests can be made online as of November 18.
