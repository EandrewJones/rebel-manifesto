Quebec - The MP for Vachon and official opposition spokesperson for transport, Martine Ouellet, calls on the Minister of Transport, Robert Poëti, to enforce the law by ensuring that the UberX service, illegal in Quebec, cease.
“UberX offers a taxi-style service, but unlike taxi drivers, it does so without the nearly $ 200,000 worth of license, without paying taxes, and without obeying regulations. This explains, in large part, why the service is cheaper. This is unfair competition for Quebec taxi drivers; the government must protect them, ”said Martine Ouellet.
Although the Minister of Transport says UberX is illegal, the service is continuously expanding in Quebec. Vehicle seizures have been made since last October, but UberX is covering the legal costs and the service continues anyway.
“If UberX continues to offer its service, the consequences for our drivers could be enormous: drop in the price of the license, significant loss of profits, decrease in customers. While these men and women have taken out mortgages of hundreds of thousands of dollars to practice the profession of taxi driver in the rules of the art, UberX continues to offer its service illegally. Because of UberX, they risk losing their jobs and retirement; this situation is unacceptable and Minister Poëti must take action, ”concluded the deputy.
