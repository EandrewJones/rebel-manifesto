Quebec - In reaction to the tabling of a draft regulation concerning the presence of French in commercial signage by the Liberal government, the member for Jonquière and leader of the official opposition, Sylvain Gaudreault, offered his collaboration to the first Minister Philippe Couillard for a legislative amendment to be made to the Charter of the French language.
“The responsibility inherent in the role of Premier of Quebec is to protect and defend the French language. Unfortunately, by his project, Philippe Couillard chose the retreat of the French. He abdicated, presenting a simple draft regulation which ruled that French must appear in the visual environment of shops. Not only is this regulation fragile and could be challenged again, but it also marks another step backwards in the language issue. At the Parti Québécois, we want to act at the source and change the law. There is no compromise to be made. I therefore offer our cooperation to the Prime Minister to change Bill 101, to strengthen the presence of French in Quebec, before the end of the session, ”declared Sylvain Gaudreault. The Leader of the Opposition also recalled that the judge, in a decision on the display language rendered in April 2015, mentions that it is up to the legislator to change the law to give a clear legal basis to the obligation. to display in French.
“The Prime Minister told us last year - and he reiterated it today - that he made the use of French &#39;a matter of politeness&#39;, when in reality it is a question of &#39;a question of respect for the official language of Quebec. What Quebeckers are asking for is a better presence of the Prime Minister for the defense and promotion of our language. The judgment is very clear: it is up to the legislator to act to accentuate the presence of the French language. The Prime Minister must tell us why he does not want to strengthen Bill 101 to protect and promote our language, ”concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
