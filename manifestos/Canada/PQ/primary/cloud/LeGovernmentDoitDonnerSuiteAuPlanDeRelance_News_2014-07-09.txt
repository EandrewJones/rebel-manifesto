Québec, July 9, 2014 - Pierre Karl Péladeau, the member for Saint-Jérôme and official opposition critic for the economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, said he was disappointed with the measures planned by the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, François Blais, following the announcement of the closure of the Electrolux plant in L&#39;Assomption.
The announcement by the Minister of Employment is far from tackling the basic problem affecting the MRC de L&#39;Assomption. “This measure is insufficient. After four years of hard work to revive the region&#39;s economy, the citizens of the MRC have a right to expect much more from such a limited pilot project. The government must continue the work started, listen and support the recovery plan proposed by the players in the field, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
It should be remembered that in May 2013, the Marois government supported the recovery plan and supported the studies necessary for the deployment of several measures suggested by stakeholders in the field.
For Dave Turcotte, Member of Parliament for Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, the $ 17 million cuts in aid measures employment, announced by Minister Blais during the study of the estimates, will not help to resolve the situation.
“Workers over the age of 50 and all those affected by plant closures must be able to count on full services from local employment centers and all those involved in employability, everywhere in Quebec. Hopefully the cuts will not affect the programs in Lanaudière or elsewhere in Quebec, ”the member for Saint-Jean worried.
