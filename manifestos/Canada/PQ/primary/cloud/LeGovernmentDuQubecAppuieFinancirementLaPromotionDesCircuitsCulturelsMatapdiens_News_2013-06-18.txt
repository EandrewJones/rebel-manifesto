“Cultural development agreements allow us to act in concert with local and regional authorities to promote the development of the arts and culture in our communities. Thanks to the realization of the Matapedia Cultural Circuits, an innovative project that uses new technologies, the MRC de La Matapédia is betting that this online cultural promotion will reach a greater number of tourists and will have the effect of encouraging them to discover the many attractions of the region, ”said Minister Kotto.
“I hope that access to these virtual cultural circuits will pique the curiosity of passing visitors and tourists and encourage them to extend their stay in the region. Because, in terms of cultural tourism, the Matapedia Valley has a lot to offer, and it is its points of interest that the designers of this mobile application wanted to make known, ”said Minister Bérubé.
Available free for the Android system and for Apple products, the Matapédiens Cultural Circuits application is available in four themes: built heritage, salmon fishing, arts and crafts and agritourism. All these circuits offer historical sections, informative texts and photographs on the tourist attractions of the region and on the places to visit. A fifth circuit, with the theme of landscapes, is in progress. The electronic application is scalable and allows the addition of circuits as well as its update.
