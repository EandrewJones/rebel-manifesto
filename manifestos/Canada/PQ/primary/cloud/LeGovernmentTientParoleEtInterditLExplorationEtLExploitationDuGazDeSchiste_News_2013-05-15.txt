Quebec - The Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet, today tabled a bill prohibiting certain activities intended to search for or exploit natural gas in shale in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. With this bill, the certificates of authorization issued will be suspended and any new issuance will be postponed until the National Assembly has adopted a comprehensive legislative framework on the exploration and exploitation of gas resources. The maximum duration of the moratorium is five years.
“With this bill, the government is fulfilling the commitment it made and which I myself reiterated last February. In addition to the mandate that will be entrusted to the BAPE, we are announcing today the ban to move forward with the shale gas industry in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. We act for consistency while waiting to know the recommendations of the BAPE and the way in which the issue will be dealt with by the National Assembly. We cannot presume the results of the consultation that the BAPE will conduct in the coming months, but in the meantime, we will respect the concerns expressed by citizens for several years, ”declared Minister Blanchet.
Recall that on February 6, 2013, the Minister announced that he would give the BAPE the mandate to conduct a broad consultation based on the studies commissioned as part of the strategic environmental assessment (SEA) on shale gas, particularly with regard to environmental, human and economic aspects. The BAPE will carry out this review as part of an extended public consultation (“generic” BAPE).
“We are committed to working for the necessary convergence between Quebec&#39;s economic and environmental interests. I also reiterated that the ministry I head would listen to groups of citizens and base its decisions on knowledge and science. This is what the approach implemented makes it possible to do. Decisions on the future of the shale gas industry can thus be taken within a framework based on the highest scientific standards. By then, a moratorium was needed. This is the meeting that Quebec and our government made, and one more commitment that the government of the Parti Québécois is making. I reiterate that the hand is extended to the opposition parties so that we are unanimous in reassuring Quebecers, ”concluded Minister Blanchet.
