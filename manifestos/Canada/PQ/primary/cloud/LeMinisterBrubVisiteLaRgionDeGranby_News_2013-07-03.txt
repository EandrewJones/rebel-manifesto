Quebec - The Minister for Tourism, Pascal Bérubé, yesterday visited two major tourist attractions in the Granby region, namely the Granby Zoo, which is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year, as well as the Verger champêtre.
Currently on a tour of Quebec in order to meet tourism players and take, in the field, the full extent of Quebec&#39;s expertise in tourism, the Minister was impressed by the scope and quality of these two attractions. “I take my hat off to the Granby Zoo and the Verger champêtre which, each in their own niche, are true models! He noted with enthusiasm.
At the Zoo, he was able to admire the recently inaugurated lorikeet aviary. This is part of a package of improvements totaling $ 4.5 million for which Tourisme Québec has granted $ 500,000. &quot;We must recognize the audacity of this immense development project,&quot; notes Mr. Bérubé. The Granby Zoo is well positioned and makes itself even more attractive to visitors from Quebec, but above all, to tourists to the south and west of our borders ”.
The Minister wished to take advantage of his visit to the site to salute the extraordinary work of Ms. Joanne Lalumière who recently announced her departure from general management. &quot;Madame Lalumière has all my admiration and gratitude for her great contribution to the development of tourism in her region and throughout Quebec,&quot; said Mr. Bérubé.
