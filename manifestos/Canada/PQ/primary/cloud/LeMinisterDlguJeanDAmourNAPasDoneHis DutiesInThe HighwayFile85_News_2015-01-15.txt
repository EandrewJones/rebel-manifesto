Québec - The MP for Vachon and official opposition critic for transport, transportation electrification and maritime strategy, Martine Ouellet, and the MP for Rimouski and chairman of the caucus of members of the Parti Québécois de l &#39; Est-du-Québec, Harold LeBel, deplore the fact that the Minister for Transport and the Implementation of the Maritime Strategy, and Minister responsible for the Bas-Saint-Laurent region, Jean D&#39;Amour, does not take his responsibilities in the file for phase 3 of the extension of Autoroute 85.
In fact, on January 9, following the tragic death of a 32-year-old woman on Route 185, the Minister Delegate D&#39;Amour lambasted the federal government and its Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Affairs. intergovernmental organizations, Denis Lebel, who are slow to announce phase 3 of highway 85, between Saint-Antonin and Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha! Minister Lebel replied that his government was still waiting for Quebec to send in its requests under the Building Canada program.
“Minister Delegate D&#39;Amour got caught and must now be honest with the people of Bas-Saint-Laurent. Before throwing blame to the right and to the left, let him do his homework; he must ensure that the file progresses as quickly as possible and avoid creating a diversion. While Quebec and Ottawa are passing the buck, Quebeckers continue to take this road which has already claimed too many victims, ”said Martine Ouellet.
“Jean D&#39;Amour has been in office for almost 10 months and he still holds a speech that changes according to events to explain the progress of the Autoroute 85 file. As Minister responsible for the Bas-Saint region -Laurent and, above all, Minister Delegate for Transport, he must be more transparent towards the population. The people of our region deserve something other than the red herring supporters that, unfortunately, the Minister serves us too often, ”concluded Harold LeBel.
