Quebec - The Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Seniors, Dr. Réjean Hébert, today announced the addition of additional professional resources in 60 family medicine groups (FMGs) across Quebec. These GMFs will share a total of 181.5 full-time equivalents (FTEs) to complete their professional workforce, which represents an annual investment of $ 13.6 million. More precisely, each of the 60 FMGs is granted between 1.5 and 5 FTEs, for an average of just over 3 FTE each.
“Adding professionals such as nutritionists, social workers or even kinesiologists to physicians is a way of supporting medical practice in FMG, because it allows better monitoring of patients, in particular those suffering from chronic diseases. »Explained Dr. Hébert.
This addition of professionals is attributed to FMGs according to their performance with regard to certain established criteria, in particular the respect and renewal of their contractual agreement, the achievement of their target of clientele registrations, as well as their service offer during unfavorable hours. (evenings and weekends), depending on the volume of patients registered. The eligibility of a GMF for the granting of additional professional resources will be assessed twice during the year, i.e. on January 1, during the review of GMF registrations, as well as at the renewal of its accreditation.
“The GMF formula has already proven its worth. Consolidation of the FMG network is therefore one of our government&#39;s priority actions to improve the accessibility and continuity of primary health care and services. We are committed to carrying out a series of measures in this direction, and the allocation of new resources for the most efficient FMGs is one of them, ”declared Minister Hébert.
