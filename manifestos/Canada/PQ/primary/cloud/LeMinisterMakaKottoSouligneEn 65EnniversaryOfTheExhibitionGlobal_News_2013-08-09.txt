Quebec - The Minister of Culture and Communications, Mr. Maka Kotto, on behalf of the Government of Quebec, wishes to mark the 65th anniversary of the publication of the Global Refusal manifesto, which was a form of revolution by wanting to bring into the world a new society from Quebec. A return to 1948 brings us back to this group of young artists of the Automatist movement. At the head of the group, the painter Paul-Émile Borduas wrote the manuscript to bring artists no longer to live on the margins of history, and society to no longer live inwardly on itself.
“Putting your signature at the bottom of the Global Refusal manifesto was a daring gesture, a call for the right to exist, a way of turning your back on academicism and speaking out loud and clear in favor of freedom of expression. This document brings with it a major shift in Quebec culture and the start of an era of artistic emancipation, ”said Minister Maka Kotto. He also added that the Global Refusal will have enabled Quebec to discover the aspirations of young artists wanting to upset the established order and traditional values of the time. They made their voices heard in the public debate and contributed to the recognition of the status of the artist.
In short, the Refus global enabled Quebec to discover the aspirations of young artists wishing to upset the established order and the prevailing traditional values of the time. In addition to the painter Paul-Émile Borduas, the other signatories of the manifesto were Françoise Sullivan, Marcelle Ferron, Muriel Guilbault, Louise Renaud, Madeleine Arbor, Thérèse Renaud, Françoise Riopelle, as well as Fernand Leduc, Pierre Gauvreau, Jean-Paul Riopelle, Marcel Barbeau, Jean-Paul Mousseau, Bruno Cormier, Maurice Perron and Claude Gauvreau.
