Quebec - The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, is pleased to grant a sum of $ 3.5 million from the Government Transportation Assistance Program suitable for people with disabilities. He made the announcement during a speech delivered this noon in Gatineau, on the occasion of the 10th annual conference of the Quebec Urban Transport Association. This sum will allow the hundred or so paratransit organizations to cope with the continued growth in demand.
“Nearly 95,000 people with disabilities have access to a paratransit service in Quebec, and this number continues to grow over the years. For our government, it is essential to enable the organizations concerned to better meet the needs of these people in order to ensure them a degree of mobility and autonomy comparable to that of the general population, ”explains Mr. Gaudreault.
