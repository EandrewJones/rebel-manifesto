Quebec - The Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, takes note of the decision taken today by the Commission municipale du Québec (CMQ) concerning the upcoming lifting of the supervision of the City of Laval.
“Today, I am happy to see that the transition that began the day after the municipal elections went smoothly and allowed Laval elected officials to assume their new mandate. It is with rigor and a great spirit of openness that these same elected officials collaborated with the supervisory council as soon as they took office in order to quickly restore full powers to the municipal council. I would also like to salute the exemplary work of the CMQ and the tutorship council which have ensured the smooth running of the City, with the interest of Laval residents as the main motivation, since last June, ”declared the Minister.
Recall that the government of Quebec placed the City of Lavalle under trusteeship on June 3 to ensure services to the population and the management of current affairs following allegations of embezzlement affecting the previous administration. The transition process will continue until the lifting of the guardianship, which will take effect on December 9.
