Quebec - The Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Seniors, Dr. Réjean Hébert, takes advantage of the 7th International Rare Disease Day to recall the importance of making the population of Quebec aware of the situation of people with diseases rare and reiterates the government&#39;s desire to offer them and their loved ones the best possible support.
“We are committed to providing people with rare diseases and their loved ones with the services they need. Due to their rarity, these diseases represent a challenge for the Quebec health network, both in terms of their treatment and their diagnosis. This is a challenge that we can meet together, in partnership with the many organizations involved in this cause, ”said Dr. Hébert.
According to the National Institute of Excellence in Health and Social Services (INESSS), a rare disease is a disease that affects one in 2,000 people. There are thousands of them, and it is estimated that 80% of them are genetic origin. Moreover, despite their rarity, these diseases affect, in total, between 6 and 8% of the population. The majority of them affect children, 30% of whom see their life expectancy reduced to five years and less.
In recent years, several initiatives have been implemented in Quebec with the objective of offering the best possible services to people with rare diseases. For example, new diseases have been included in the Quebec Neonatal Blood Screening Program, in order to ensure their treatment more quickly. In addition, the Ministry of Health and Social Services provided financial support to Orphanet Quebec, a Quebec division of an international program that aims to set up a database on rare diseases to facilitate access to information and collaboration.
