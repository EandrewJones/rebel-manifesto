Quebec - It is with sadness that the Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, learned of the death of the great actress Hélène Loiselle. In many ways, this committed artist can be considered as one of the pioneers in the development of theater in Quebec. His contributions were innumerable and nothing that touched on interpretation was foreign to him. His name appears on the cast of the first radio novels and radio theaters produced in Quebec.
“Hélène Loiselle will have marked Quebec theater and cinema through her unique way of transcending characters. She has admirably defended her roles in Michel Tremblay&#39;s first plays: Les belles-sœurs; In spare parts; Yours, forever, your Marie-Lou. She leaves us with the memory of an accomplished artist with a vibrant game while restraint. Of course, we cannot ignore his social and political commitment and his deep attachment to Quebec, ”said Minister Kotto.
Very discreet in life, she literally exploded on stage and on screen, with characters she loved to play with originality and who testified to her great versatility. Leading roles have been entrusted to her in numerous soap operas and television series, and she was also part of the adventure of the first youth programs on Quebec television. In the golden age of teletheatres broadcast by Radio-Canada, she performed in a number of classical and contemporary works.
The Minister wished to present his condolences to the relatives of the actress and to the entire artistic community.
