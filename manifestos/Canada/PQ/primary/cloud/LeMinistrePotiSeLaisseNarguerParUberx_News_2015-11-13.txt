Montreal - The deputy for Vachon and transport spokesperson for the Parti Québécois, Martine Ouellet, deplores that the illegal taxi service UberX continues to expand in Quebec, under the nose of the Minister of Transport, Robert Poëti, who refuses to act.
“Since its arrival in Quebec, the illegal UberX transport service has continued to grow. The company announced yesterday, with great fanfare, that it would henceforth serve the cities of Laval and Longueuil. Meanwhile, while the company continues to expand by defying the laws of Quebec, Minister Poëti says lip service that the service is illegal, ”said Martine Ouellet.
Earlier this week, the company spokesperson said the number of UberX rides was on the rise. This fall, during the taxi drivers&#39; protest days, UberX even had the nerve to offer discounts to its members. The company literally taunts the Government of Quebec, and Minister Poëti is content to watch the parade.
“I have repeatedly asked Minister Poëti to put an end to UberX&#39;s illegal operations. I even tabled an amendment in parliamentary committee to increase the fines imposed on illegal taxis, but the minister rejected it. If he&#39;s really serious when he says he wants to tackle the illegality of UberX, I offer my full cooperation to pass a bill by Christmas. This law could provide for much larger fines, prolonged vehicle seizures, demerit points, even going as far as the suspension of licenses for repeat offenders. Honest taxi drivers fight every day for a pay sometimes below the minimum wage. They must now deal with increasingly fierce illegal and unfair competition, because the Liberal government is dragging its feet, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
