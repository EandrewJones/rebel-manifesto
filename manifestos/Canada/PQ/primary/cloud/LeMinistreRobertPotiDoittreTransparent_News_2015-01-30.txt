Québec - Following the broadcast yesterday of a report from the program Enquête about the light rail system (LRT) on the new Champlain Bridge, the member for Vachon and spokesperson for the official opposition in in terms of transport, electrification of transport and maritime strategy, Martine Ouellet, asks Minister Robert Poëti to be transparent and to make public the AECOM study and the report of the committee of experts.
“I hope this is not another maneuver by the Liberal government to discredit the SLR and the Agence métropolitaine de transport (AMT). Currently, we are swimming in the dark; the Minister of Transport, Robert Poëti, has repeatedly refused to make public the study of the firm AECOM and, today, another report of a mysterious committee of independent experts has surfaced. We are witnessing, in the case of the SLR, a rebound every two months. More than ever, the Minister must be clear in his intentions and transparent to the public, ”said Martine Ouellet.
The MP adds that by stepping back on the choice of SLR and by introducing a new player into the equation, namely the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, the Minister is once again extending the deadlines and increasing the costs of the study. of the project.
The day after the report was broadcast on the program Enquête, the Parti Québécois wanted to clarify a few facts. Let us first recall that the choice of the Parti Québécois government, which opted for the technological family of the SLR, was based on an AECOM study. The project office then had to select the most suitable technology. The Parti Québécois is in fact of the opinion that analytical studies should not be carried out by potential suppliers. Then, in the SLR file, the studies entrusted to the Bombardier / SNC-Lavalin consortium were carried out before the Parti Québécois came to power in September 2012. Finally, the current president and CEO of the AMT has erected a barrier between suppliers and AMT decisions.
