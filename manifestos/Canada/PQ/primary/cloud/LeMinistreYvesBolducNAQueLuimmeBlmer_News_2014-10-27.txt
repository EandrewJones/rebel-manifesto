Québec, October 27, 2014 - Nicole Léger, the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for elementary and secondary education and school perseverance, considers that the Minister of Education, Loisir et du Sport, Yves Bolduc, is solely responsible for the unfortunate situation in which schools in Quebec find themselves at present. This morning, we learned in Le Soleil that the Commission scolaire des Découvreurs is threatening a lawsuit against a school that refuses to cut homework assistance and the purchase of books. “For several weeks, the Liberal minister said loud and clear that the cuts he decreed in Quebec schools did not affect direct services to students. Then, he puts in tutelage school boards that refuse to obey him. Now, school boards are putting schools on notice! Instead of talking about the quality of education to be offered to children, we are in legal proceedings. It is the fault of Minister Yves Bolduc; he created these situations of uncertainty and must now assume responsibility for them, up to what is expected of a Minister of Education, ”said Nicole Léger. Remember that at the beginning of October, the Liberal government supported a motion presented by the Parti Québécois, and reflecting the comments made by the minister for months, so that the cuts do not affect direct services to students. “Rarely have we seen a minister act so clumsily. Yves Bolduc painted himself in the corner, it&#39;s now up to him to get out of it. One thing is certain, he cannot leave the schools entangled in this quagmire; he must act quickly, ”concluded the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles.
