Quebec - MNA for Matapedia and official opposition critic for social services and seniors, Danielle Doyer, and MNA for Saint-Jean, Dave Turcotte, demand that the Liberal government backtrack for the three new CHSLD projects in PPP mode planned in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Châteauguay and Granby. &quot;Faced with the fiasco of the first CHSLD project in PPP mode in Saint-Lambert-sur-le-Golf, it is high time for the Minister of Health to stop ignoring the major shortcomings in the delivery of care to residents&quot;, said the member for Matapedia.
Families and relatives of seniors housed at the CHSLD Saint-Lambert-sur-le-Golf who notice slippages are worried. “Families, members of the Coalition against PPP in Montérégie and the Quebec Association for the Defense of the Rights of Retired and Pre-Retired People are calling for a coroner&#39;s inquest to shed light on the deaths that occurred in obscure circumstances. It is not normal to have come to this! The new structure in PPP mode is the blind choice of a government which should have more interest and compassion towards residents and which should want at all costs to avoid tragedies, ”added the spokesperson for social services. and seniors, Danielle Doyer.
“Today, on behalf of the families who have lost a loved one in still unclear circumstances, it is time for the Minister of Health to act. A real common front is being formed in Montérégie and we are asking the Liberal government to step back and immediately announce that the other three 66-space projects will be carried out in public mode. The Liberal government&#39;s strategy of letting our seniors “get old on the cheap” should stop immediately, ”concluded Danielle Doyer and Dave Turcotte.
