Quebec - Reacting to the revelation of the Chief Electoral Officer (DGE) that the Liberal Party of Quebec refused him, in May 2015, the reimbursement of illegal contributions, the member for Marie-Victorin and parliamentary leader of the official opposition, Bernard Drainville, notes that nothing has changed in the Liberal Party since Philippe Couillard is at its head.
Indeed, during the clause-by-clause consideration of Bill 101, An Act to follow up on the recommendations of the Charbonneau Commission in matters of political financing, the Chief Electoral Officer indicated that the Liberal Party had refused, in May 2015, to remit to him an illegal contribution following a claim on his part.
&quot;During the election campaign in 2014, the Prime Minister promised us a profound renewal in terms of political financing, but it is clear that we are still in the presence of the good old Liberal Party,&quot; said Bernard Drainville.
Recall that on September 17, 2013, following the announcement of a search of the Liberal Party headquarters, Philippe Couillard indicated that he would fully assume his responsibilities with the CEO and that the reimbursement of sums illegally collected could make it. part.
&quot;It is clear that the leader of the Liberal Party is not taking his responsibilities and that there is still some cleaning to be done within the PLQ,&quot; concluded Bernard Drainville.
