Quebec - The member for Richelieu and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in labor matters, Sylvain Rochon, deplores the partisan decision of the Liberal MPs, who rejected his request that the Committee on the Economy and Labor be seized of a mandate of initiative on the minimum wage.
“On August 22, Prime Minister Philippe Couillard publicly declared that he wanted a debate on the minimum wage. However, at the first opportunity, its deputies voted against our request for a mandate of initiative in this direction. It is totally inconsistent on their part to refuse to hold the debate that their own leader is openly demanding! », Declared Sylvain Rochon first.
“To rigorously assess the rate of increase in the minimum wage, this issue must be taken out of partisan forums. However, the Liberals&#39; unfortunate decision denies members of Parliament an opportunity to hold public consultations on this complex issue. The debate is already pervasive, and all points of view must be heard. Why not study the file in parliamentary committee? », Then asked the member for Richelieu.
“We wanted to see the Committee on the Economy and Labor take up our mandate, but the Liberal deputies invoked the need to await the conclusion of the government reflections on poverty. But how can we not think that the holding of the Forum of Ideas for Quebec has the main objective of diverting our attention and putting the discussion on the minimum wage back to the end of the day? In addition to greatly distressing us, the attitude of the Liberal members surprises us; on other subjects, such as social assistance, they do not get caught up in the same considerations. Their pretext therefore does not hold water. All they want is to save time, ”the spokesperson concluded.
