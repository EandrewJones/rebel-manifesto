Quebec - On the pretext that the elections could possibly coincide with a religious holiday, the Liberal Party of Quebec today refused its consent to debate an emotion presented jointly to the National Assembly by the Minister responsible for Democratic Institutions and Participation citizen, Bernard Drainville, the parliamentary leader of the second opposition group and deputy for Chauveau, Gérard Deltell, and the deputy for Mercier, Amir Khadir. This motion reaffirms that the choice of the date of the general elections should not be made according to the calendar of religious holidays, but according to the general interest.
“By refusing its consent, by refusing to vote for the motion, the Liberal Party is showing very clearly that it does not agree to give voters the date of the election. The general elections are a great democratic event that no Quebec citizen should miss. This is why the Election Act provides for ways to ensure that all electors can exercise their right, whether by advance notice, by mail ballot or directly at the office of their returning officer. The date is not fixed according to the calendar of religious festivals, and should not be. We live in a society where the separation between religions and the State is a fundamental value, and we will not derogate from this principle on the issue of fixed-date elections: that would send all Quebecers a very bad message, ”he added. declared the minister.
This is why Bernard Drainville, Gérard Deltell and Amir Khadir tabled the following motion:
“During the meetings of the Advisory Committee of the Chief Electoral Officer, which served to establish the consensus of the political parties on Bill 3, all the parties agreed on a date. It seems that for basely partisan reasons, the Liberals have abandoned this fine consensus and are now trying to divide Quebeckers on the date of the election. Unfortunately, this is confirmed by their refusal to support our motion today, ”lamented Bernard Drainville.
