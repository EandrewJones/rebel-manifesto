Quebec, May 3, 2017 - In reaction to the categorical refusal of the Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, to act on the recommendations of the report on tax havens affecting the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), the leader of the opposition official, Jean-François Lisée, and the Parti Québécois finance spokesperson, Nicolas Marceau, denounced the government&#39;s lack of will and consistency in this matter.
IN SHORT
“When I asked him this week about the significant increase over the past three years in investments by the Caisse de dépôt in tax havens - they rose to $ 26.2 billion - the Prime Minister said said disagree with this practice. But, during the study of appropriations, the Minister of Finance, completely ignoring the opinion of his leader, refused to implement the report on tax havens, ”lamented Jean-François Lisée.
Indeed, Carlos Leitão refused to ask the Fund to gradually reduce its investments in companies that engage in abusive tax avoidance or tax evasion, or to stop increasing them. “The Minister of Finance refused to act on two of the unanimous recommendations specific to the Caisse contained in the report on tax havens. By the same token, he endorses the vision expressed by the CEO of the Fund and chooses the status quo. Nothing more will be done, while the processes in place have made it possible to invest $ 26 billion in tax havens, ”for his part denounced Nicolas Marceau.
“Public services are finding it difficult to finance themselves. States lose significant tax revenues. Quebec can and must play a leadership role in the fight against tax havens, and follow the global movement in this direction. The Parti Québécois therefore wishes the implementation of all the recommendations of the report on tax havens, ”concluded the leader of the Parti Québécois.
