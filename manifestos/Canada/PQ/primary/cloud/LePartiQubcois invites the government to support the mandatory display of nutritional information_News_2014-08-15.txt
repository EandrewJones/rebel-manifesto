Quebec, August 15, 2014 - The Parti Québécois invites the Minister for Public Health, Lucie Charlebois, to support the proposal to make the display of nutritional information mandatory in fast food chains. The member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for prevention, Jean? François Lisée, and the member for Labelle and spokesperson for healthy lifestyles, Sylvain Pagé, want this idea to be translated into action.
On the one hand, the clarity and consistency of nutrition labeling throughout Quebec would allow consumers of fast food chains to make more informed choices about the health risks that certain foods represent. On the other hand, changes in eating behavior, resulting from the mandatory posting of this information, could engage Quebecers in healthier lifestyles.
Remember that the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Yves Bolduc, committed last June to very soon present a national policy on sport, recreation and physical activity. He also wants to pursue the Parti Québécois objective of making Quebec one of the fittest nations in the world within 10 years.
“This is the perfect opportunity for his colleague Lucie Charlebois to give the future policy a transversal application, by adopting this measure to promote healthy lifestyles,” said Sylvain Pagé.
“The government must move forward with concrete measures to prevent the health risks associated with junk food. It is time to give real impetus to this ambition to provide Quebec with a national health prevention policy, ”added Jean? François Lisée.
