Quebec - Alexandre Cloutier, the member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of education and school perseverance, marks World Teachers&#39; Day on behalf of the entire deputation of his political party and teachers, as decreed in 1994 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO.
“We believe that it is particularly important to remember the titanic work accomplished every day by the teachers of Quebec, especially since the government is no longer even hiding to despise them. The Minister of Education went so far as to say that it would be &quot;awkward&quot; to reinvest in education, to reinvest in support for students in difficulty. And, after that, he wonders why teachers are mobilizing, ”said Alexandre Cloutier.
It should be remembered that the Liberal Party has made huge cuts in schools, particularly in the positions of professionals who work with young people with learning or adaptation difficulties integrated into regular classes. “This situation increases the burden on teachers, who have less time to devote to each of the children. It affects the quality of teaching. And to say that the government wants to add a layer by increasing the teacher-student ratios and no longer taking into account students in difficulty in the constitution of groups. This is totally unacceptable, ”added the member for the Parti Québécois.
“Negotiations between teachers and the government cannot be dissociated from the quality of education in Quebec. This is why we will continue to make the voice of teachers heard over the coming weeks and months, ”concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
