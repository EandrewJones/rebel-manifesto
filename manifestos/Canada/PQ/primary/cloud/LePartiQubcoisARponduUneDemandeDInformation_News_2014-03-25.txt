Montreal - As part of its mission, UPAC has expressed its desire to meet all political parties, including the Parti Québécois, on an informal basis. These meetings, at the request of UPAC, were to remain confidential.
Since the existence of this meeting was revealed to a media, the Parti Québécois wishes to make public all the information on this subject, so as not to maintain any confusion between the situation of the Liberal Party, which was searched, and that from the Parti Québécois, who were asked to explain its structure and funding methods.
Last February, the director general of the Parti Québécois, Sylvain Tanguay, and the director of finance and administration, Pierre Séguin, met informally with two investigating sergeants from the Marteau squad.
Investigators said they wanted to obtain information from all political parties about the party&#39;s funding, its structure and methods of funding.
The representatives of the Parti Québécois explained that its funding is provided by volunteers, that for each donation, a form was duly completed with all the information on the donor and a receipt was issued. It was also confirmed that the volunteer ensures that all donations are made personally.
Regarding the funding objectives, it was explained that they are established according to the number of members in each constituency, and not on the basis of the fact that it is represented by a deputy or a minister of the Parti Québécois.
Remember that a complaint was filed today by the Parti Québécois with the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec to investigate a fundraising activity that would have brought in $ 428,000 to the Liberal Party, without it being published. in its financial report. This information came to light following a UPAC search of the headquarters of the Liberal Party.
The Parti Québécois was not subjected to any search, had no other meeting with investigators and no document was requested.
