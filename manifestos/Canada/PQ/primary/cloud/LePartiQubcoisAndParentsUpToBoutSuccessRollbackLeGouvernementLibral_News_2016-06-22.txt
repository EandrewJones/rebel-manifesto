Quebec - Jean-François Lisée, the member for Rosemont and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in social services, youth protection, home care and prevention, is delighted that the Liberal government has announced aid parents of severely disabled children.
“The few mothers who, for months, have been carrying at arm&#39;s length the demands of thousands of families caring for a disabled child deserve our hat. I am happy that their efforts, combined with our repeated interventions with Ministers Barrette and Charlebois in the National Assembly, are finally yielding concrete results and giving hope for an improvement in their situation. We invest every day for the citizens, for the parents, for the families, and this retreat of the Liberal government, which had stubbornly refused to help these mothers and their children, greatly rejoices us ”, declared Jean-François Lisee.
“Remember that after Minister Lucie Charlebois informed mothers that they would never win their case, it was her colleague Gaétan Barrette who had to take over and work to find a way out. After he publicly declared that the mothers&#39; demands would cost him 42 billion and ridiculed their demands and their situation, we are reassured today to see that he has recovered his sanity. Let us now hope that this gesture is not the only one that Gaétan Barrette will make to meet the growing needs for home care and intermediate resources, ”concluded the Member for Rosemont.
