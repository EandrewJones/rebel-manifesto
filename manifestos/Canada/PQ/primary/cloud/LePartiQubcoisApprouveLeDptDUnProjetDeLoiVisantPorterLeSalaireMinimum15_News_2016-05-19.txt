Quebec - The member for Richelieu and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in labor matters, Sylvain Rochon, and the member for Rousseau and spokesperson in finance, Nicolas Marceau, approve the study of a bill that would bring about on the gradual increase in the minimum wage, until a target of $ 15 per hour is reached.
&quot;We support the new motion presented by Québec solidaire since it now proposes a bill that would set a target of $ 15 an hour for the minimum wage, as well as annual increase criteria that would make it possible to achieve this target&quot; , said Sylvain Rochon.
The member for Richelieu also proposed an amendment to the motion presented by Québec solidaire so that “the National Assembly undertakes to study a bill to this effect by the end of this legislature”. &quot;The original text required that a possible bill be passed by the end of this Parliament, but since we are facing a Liberal majority government, we do not want to commit to passing a bill that parliamentarians have never seen yet, ”he said.
“Our goal is obviously to offer the highest possible minimum wage, as long as this does not translate into a decrease in the number of jobs available to workers. Everyone has the right to the best conditions and safe workplaces to contribute to our collective prosperity. We hope that, as part of the tabling of a bill, general consultations will be held in order to hear stakeholders and experts from all sectors of society who would make it possible to determine the criteria and the pace of salary increases. most appropriate minimums to fight against poverty and ensure the growth of our economy ”, for his part indicated Nicolas Marceau.
“By reducing disposable income, the Liberal government has severely affected workers and their families. This is why we are asking that it reinvest in the various missions of the State and allow parliamentarians to assess the possibility of raising the minimum wage up to $ 15, ”concluded the Member for Rousseau.
