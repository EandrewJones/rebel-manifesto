Quebec– The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of the environment, the fight against climate change and responsible for the Estrie region, Sylvain Gaudreault, and the spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Sylvain Rochon, join their voice to the “SOS Mont Hereford” campaign and demand that Hydro-Quebec&#39;s Northern Pass power line project respect the integrity of the Hereford Community Forest, in the MRC of Coaticook.
IN SHORT
** - The route of the Quebec portion of Hydro-Quebec&#39;s Northern Pass power line project must respect the integrity of the Hereford Community Forest;
“The Hereford Community Forest is one of the all too rare conservation areas in the Eastern Townships. It is a natural environment of great importance, both for its biodiversity and for the ecotourism development possibilities it offers for the MRC of Coaticook. The BAPE report clearly indicates that the route advocated by Hydro-Québec would cause significant damage to this protected territory and that alternatives exist. The Quebec government must do everything to ensure the preservation of this unique territory, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
&quot;Quebeckers cannot accept that the Northern Pass line is buried for nearly 97 km in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, while on the Quebec side, we do not even bother to protect the territory of Mount Hereford over a distance of 18 km. The cost difference for Hydro-Québec would be about $ 70 million; this is barely 3% of the total cost of the project, estimated at $ 2 billion. The impact would be all the more minimal since, because of the landfill on the American side, the line will already be limited to a voltage level and a lower lifespan than Hydro-Québec could have obtained. If the profitability of this electricity export project depends only on this small difference, the government must bring Hydro-Quebec back to order! », Demanded Sylvain Rochon.
