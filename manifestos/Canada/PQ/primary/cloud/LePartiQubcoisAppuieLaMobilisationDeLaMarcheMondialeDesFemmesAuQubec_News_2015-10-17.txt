Quebec - The member of the Parti Québécois, spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, supports the caravan of the World March of Women in Quebec and, by doing so, sends her warmest thanks and congratulations to each and every one of them. its artisans.
“If the cause of women has made great strides in recent decades, important struggles remain to be waged. We must, in particular, fight austerity measures which threaten our achievements, or which hamper progress, ”said Carole Poirier.
Remember that each cut in the areas of health, social services, day care services, social assistance, employment assistance, education, community housing or local development, to name a few, is done mainly to the detriment of women.
“We are concerned, for example, about recent cuts in programs promoting equality between women and men, as well as in the budgets of the Council for the Status of Women. We are concerned, too, when we see the reduction in the amounts allocated to the prevention of sexual exploitation and the recruitment of young women into street gangs, ”added the MP.
At the Parti Québécois, we know that it is better to invest our energies and our budgets upstream, unite our forces and remain united for the cause of women. “We reiterate our support for your action,” concluded Carole Poirier.
