Québec, August 28, 2016 - The member for Sanguinet and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of economy, energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, the member for Terrebonne and spokesperson for the environment and fight against climate change, Mathieu Traversy, as well as the member for Verchères and spokesperson for Quebec-Canada relations, Stéphane Bergeron, supported the request of the mayor of Montreal, Denis Coderre, that the hearings of the National Energy Board (NEB) on TransCanada&#39;s Energy East project.
“By hiding the fact that Jean Charest lobbied Ottawa on behalf of TransCanada, the NEB commissioners have made this federal body lose all credibility. The evaluation process is visibly riddled with irregularities; what is Philippe Couillard waiting for to denounce them? Do the Liberals still endorse the secret lobbying activities of their former leader? There is no other solution: the Quebec government must launch its own evaluation process for the Energy East project, ”said Alain Therrien.
“Let&#39;s not forget: this project is far from having won the game in terms of social acceptability. It involves enormous environmental and safety risks for Quebec. In return, the Quebec population will derive practically no benefit from it; Energy East does not even aim to supply it with oil! It is unthinkable that Quebecers do not have a say in an issue so crucial to their collective future, ”insisted Mathieu Traversy.
“It has been shown time and time again: you cannot trust the NEB. Neither to conduct the evaluation exercise in full transparency, nor to take into account the interests of Quebeckers. In addition, it is we who would see our territory put at risk. This is why the final decision concerning Energy East must be taken by Quebeckers and by them alone, ”summarized Stéphane Bergeron.
