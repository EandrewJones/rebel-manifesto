Québec - Sylvain Gaudreault, the MNA for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and the environment, as well as the MNA for Gaspé and spokesperson for municipal affairs and regional development, Gaétan Lelièvre, demanded from the Minister of the Environment, David Heurtel, that he entrust the BAPE with a mandate in connection with the Haldimand oil project, in order to follow up on requests from citizens and the City of Gaspé.
Sylvain Gaudreault argues that the oil sector cannot avoid this exercise of citizen participation. “In this area, many questions remain unanswered. What is happening with Pétrolia&#39;s specific project is a foretaste of the questions that the Minister of the Environment will sooner or later have to answer. We must seek the answers quickly and from a neutral body, ”he said.
It should be remembered that the assessment of the knowledge of the strategic environmental assessment on the whole of the hydrocarbon sector, published in March 2015, in particular underlined the multiple shortcomings of the Quebec legislative and regulatory framework, the impossibility of quantifying the overall impact of oil projects. on GHG emissions, the insufficient level of preparedness of municipalities for accidents or major spills, and the lack of characterization of groundwater.
“The people of Gaspé understand more than anyone the possible consequences of oil projects on their quality of life, their drinking water supply, public health and the environment. Subjecting the Haldimand project to the BAPE would be a first for the petroleum sector in Quebec. There is a consensus between the citizens, the City of Gaspé and the company that a mandate be given to it for this purpose. If we want to gain the trust of stakeholders, we need independent data and impartial supervision, ”concluded the Member for Gaspé.
