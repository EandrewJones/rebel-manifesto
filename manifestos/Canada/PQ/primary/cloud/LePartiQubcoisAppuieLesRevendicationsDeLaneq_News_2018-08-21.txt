The member for Sanguinet, Alain Therrien, as well as Me Guillaume Rousseau, candidate of the Parti Québécois in Sherbrooke, today met Me Marc Dion and Me André Gauvin, respectively president and vice-president of the association Les Avocats et Notaires de l Quebec State (LANEQ). At the end of this meeting, the representatives of the Parti Québécois reiterated the support of their political formation for the demands of LANEQ.
“State lawyers and notaries play an essential role in a rule of law like Quebec. Moreover, the entire public service deserves respect and recognition. But, during the strike by lawyers and notaries, the Liberal government only served them with arrogance and contempt, ”said Guillaume Rousseau.
Let us recall that LANEQ asks that the working conditions of its members be determined following recommendations made by an independent remuneration committee to the National Assembly, as is the case for their fellow prosecutors in penal and criminal proceedings.
“In my opinion, the main distinction between the Parti Québécois and certain other parties is that we understand the importance of the expertise of the public service to carry out our commitments. It is quite the opposite of some of our political opponents, who show no embarrassment in openly despising the public service, ”added Alain Therrien.
