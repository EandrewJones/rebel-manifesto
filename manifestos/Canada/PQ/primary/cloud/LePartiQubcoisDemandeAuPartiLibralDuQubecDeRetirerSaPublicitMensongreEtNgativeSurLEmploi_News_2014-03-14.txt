Montreal - The Parti Québécois calls on the Liberal Party of Quebec to withdraw its false and negative advertising on employment.
The Institut de la statistique du Québec (ISQ) yesterday released final data on employment. In its report, the organization states that 47,800 jobs were created in Quebec in 2013, the majority being full-time. In its advertisement recently made public, the PLQ circulates erroneous data. He must therefore withdraw it.
The ISQ is a public, credible and neutral body. The data it publishes are the same data that were used in the economic forecasts of the former Liberal Minister Raymond Bachand and all the former Liberal Ministers of Finance. By criticizing them yesterday, Philippe Couillard changes a recognized calculation method, only to darken the picture and alarm the population.
Moreover, it is interesting to note that the Liberal leader admits that he would not change the ISQ&#39;s calculation methods if he were brought to power.
The Liberal Party candidate in Nelligan, Martin Coiteux, acknowledged in the daily Le Devoir that &quot;the liberal method could result in&quot; aberrations &quot;.
The Parti Québécois candidates are determined to create jobs across Quebec. Through the bold policies it has put in place, the Parti Québécois government continues to support entrepreneurs, encourage their succession, and support businesses in the social economy and the environment sectors.
We have a plan and the team to be successful. Today, it is time to give ourselves the means to go even further.
