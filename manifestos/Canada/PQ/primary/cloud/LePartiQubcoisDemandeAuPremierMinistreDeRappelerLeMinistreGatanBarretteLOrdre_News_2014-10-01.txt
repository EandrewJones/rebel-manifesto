Québec, October 1, 2014 - The MNA for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, asks Premier Philippe Couillard to call the Minister of Health and Social Services, Gaétan Barrette, to order for his remarks contemptuous he held towards parliamentarians of the official opposition and the former Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Seniors, Réjean Hébert.
“For two days, Minister Barrette has insulted people who do not think like him. He accuses them in particular of being liars. It was first Dave Turcotte, then Diane Lamarre, and now it&#39;s the turn of the former Minister of Health, Réjean Hébert. On the eve of his participation in the Anti-Bullying Forum, the Prime Minister must say that such comments are unacceptable, especially from a member of his team. The minister&#39;s inappropriate and intimidating comments must stop, ”said Stéphane Bédard.
