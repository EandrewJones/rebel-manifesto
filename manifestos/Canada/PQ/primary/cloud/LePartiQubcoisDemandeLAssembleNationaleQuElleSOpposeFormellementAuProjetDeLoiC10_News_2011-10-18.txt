Quebec - “Bill C-10 strikes head-on against Quebec values. We must therefore step up actions to curb the ardor of the Conservative government. Unfortunately, the Charest government is silent, a silence that makes it complicit. The National Assembly must clearly oppose the provisions of the bill which go against the values and interests of Quebec ”.
This was stated by the member for Joliette and official opposition critic for justice, Véronique Hivon, who will present a motion to the National Assembly tomorrow that will require a vote by all members.
For the Parti Québécois, it is imperative that Quebec vigorously oppose this Conservative initiative which, in addition to harming the reintegration efforts advocated by Quebecers, would have a significant effect on Quebec&#39;s finances. &quot;Quebec must answer federal Minister Vic Toews that there is no question of financially assuming the cost of this conservative logic, he who would like us to cut in education, in social assistance or in our social services&quot; , added Véronique Hivon. Remember that the costs of this bill for Quebec are in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
The motion to be debated and put to the vote reads as follows:
“Correspondence federalism, behind closed doors, has no place in the defense of Quebec values. The Liberal government of Jean Charest must demonstrate its sincerity by publicly and vigorously opposing this Conservative project. Our Quebec model of justice for adolescents is an effective model and allows us to have one of the lowest crime rates in America, ”concluded Véronique Hivon.
