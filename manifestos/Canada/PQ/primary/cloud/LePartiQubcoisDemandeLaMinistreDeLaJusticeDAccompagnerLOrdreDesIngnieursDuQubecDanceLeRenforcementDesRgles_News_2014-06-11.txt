Quebec - The Parti Québécois expressed its concern after new complaints were filed by the Office of the Syndic of the Order of Engineers of Quebec against six engineers and a former member of the Order allegedly involved in activities of collusion. The member for Labelle and official opposition spokesperson for professional laws, Sylvain Pagé, wants the Minister of Justice to support the Order in its work to strengthen the rules.
&quot;This situation concerns us and we believe that the Minister should take a close look at the work of the Annual General Meeting of the Ordre des ingénieurs du Québec,&quot; said Sylvain Pagé. It should be noted that the Office of the Syndic currently manages around 800 investigations, of which nearly 500 are related to cases of collusion, corruption or illegal political contributions.
“The Minister has a duty to accompany the Order and must respond to the proposals that will be adopted tomorrow by the members. We hope that the state of the financial situation and the will of the administrators of the Order will make it possible to assume the mission of protecting the public. Like the public, we want to restore confidence, which has been seriously shaken by the criminal charges, the ongoing investigations and the revelations made to the Charbonneau commission. This is why the members of the Parti Québécois will be vigilant in matters of ethics and integrity, ”concluded the spokesperson.
