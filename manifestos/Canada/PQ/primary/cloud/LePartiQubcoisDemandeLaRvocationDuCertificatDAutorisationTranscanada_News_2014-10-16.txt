Québec, October 16, 2014 - Sylvain Gaudreault, the member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and the environment, once again asks the Minister of Sustainable Development, the Environment and the Fight against against climate change, David Heurtel, to revoke the certificate of authorization granted to TransCanada for drilling work in Gros-Cacouna, as permitted by the Environment Quality Act.
The Parti Québécois deplores that Minister Heurtel is giving TransCanada another chance to comply with the laws and regulations of the Ministry of the Environment. “The company violated the main condition of the authorization certificate granted in August by the Minister. TransCanada had until yesterday to comply with the law, which it failed to do. After a succession of government boondoggles in this case and the interlocutory judgment of the Superior Court last September, there is no longer any possible defense for Minister Heurtel; he must revoke the authorization certificate without delay, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
The member for Jonquière also recalls that on Friday, the ministry sent two notices of non-compliance with the conditions of the certificate of authorization granted to TransCanada. “It&#39;s another scathing admission that the company doesn&#39;t care about environmental rules. For Minister Heurtel, this should be very serious. The noise level is what most affects belugas during construction. If the company is not even able to comply with the certificate of authorization, the minister must revoke it immediately. Beluga whales will not have a second chance, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
