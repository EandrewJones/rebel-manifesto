Quebec - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for the Conseil du trésor as well as in matters of information resources, the economy, exports and pension plans, Alain Therrien, asks the government to hold a study commission on IT management and the awarding of contracts within the Quebec government.
“Government IT contracts are expensive for Quebecers, and government managers are overwhelmed by events. We need a global diagnosis of what is wrong. This is why we are asking for the creation of an independent study commission ”, declared Alain Therrien.
The study commission can be created by a simple government decree. The two most recent examples are the Coulombe commission, on forestry, and the Pronovost commission, on agriculture. “These two commissions have studied their sector independently and in depth. They had the power and the mandate to reassess the model in place, which UPAC or the Auditor General cannot do. The time has come to serve the same medicine in the IT sector within the Quebec state. Cost overruns, project management, the role of the private sector, governance, the role of free software… all these elements must be combed through and examined in a comprehensive manner. The commission will be able to make diagnoses, and propose appropriate remedies, ”added the deputy for Sanguinet.
“The future commission will also have to look at what is being done elsewhere, and propose new avenues for the Quebec state, because we need a change in culture, model and way of working with IT. The latter and all information technologies are and will remain essential; the State must therefore be updated, ”concluded Alain Therrien.
