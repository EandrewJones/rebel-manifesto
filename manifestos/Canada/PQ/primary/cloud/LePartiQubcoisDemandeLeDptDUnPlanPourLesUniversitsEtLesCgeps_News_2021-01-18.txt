Quebec, January 17, 2021 - The leader of the Parti Québécois, Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, as well as the member for Bonaventure and party spokesperson for higher education, Sylvain Roy, are calling on the government to table a plan to guarantee the quality of education in higher education institutions. In addition, the Parti Québécois wants the government to speed up the improvement in mental health assistance offered to students.
IN SHORT
-The Parti Québécois asks the Minister of Higher Education, Danielle McCann, to table a plan to guarantee the quality of education in higher education institutions.
-We have not noticed any improvement in mental health assistance, more than two months after the announcement of new sums supposed to improve it; the government must step up its pace in order to reduce the psychological distress that many students are feeling.
-To counter the isolation of students, the Parti Québécois also asks Minister McCann to study the possibility of setting up hybrid classes, in particular by using the rapid tests available.
“While university courses have already started and the return to CEGEP is upon us, the government gives the impression of having forgotten our young adults. There do not appear to be clear guidelines from the ministry to ensure a minimum threshold in the quality of teaching, and we have been told several issues related to this. For example, some students were only allowed a PDF to complete all of their courses! “, First mentioned Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, who adds that the teachers are also left to fend for themselves, while the teaching conditions have never been so difficult. &quot;The government must give clear directives and offer more supervision,&quot; insists the leader of the Parti Québécois.
In addition, the current situation poses many psychological challenges. “Currently, 64% of college students say their psychological health is deteriorating. About 6% even evoke suicidal thoughts! We simply cannot be passive in the face of such numbers. It&#39;s been two months since the government announced new amounts to improve mental health assistance, but nothing has materialized on the ground to date. We don&#39;t even know when and how this help will come. In addition, yesterday&#39;s speech by the Prime Minister left us with more questions than answers. I therefore ask him to listen to the cry of the hearts of the students and to act immediately; we have long since passed the reflection stage, ”continued Sylvain Roy.
“One of the problems often mentioned is isolation,” continued Paul St-Pierre Plamondon; to counter it, we can think of setting up hybrid classes, as demanded by student associations. Over two months ago, we asked Minister McCann if she had considered this possibility, and we are still awaiting the answer. With the arrival of rapid tests, I reiterate our proposal to the government: it must assess this possibility, and deploy all the necessary resources to make it safe. &quot;
