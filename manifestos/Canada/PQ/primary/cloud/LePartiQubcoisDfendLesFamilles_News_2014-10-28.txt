Québec, October 28, 2014 - In a motion tabled today, the member for Terrebonne and official opposition critic for families, Mathieu Traversy, asks the Liberal government to commit to maintaining financial support for community day care centers.
“Community drop-in centers welcome nearly 45,000 children each year. They help many families, often among the most vulnerable in our society. We share the concern of the Association des haltes-garderies communautaire du Québec and we deplore the government&#39;s lack of transparency as well as the concern it sows in all areas, but especially within families, ”said Mathieu. Traversy.
The unanimously adopted motion reads as follows:
“That the National Assembly recognize the important work of community day care centers which respond to a wide range of family and social realities and which aim to support Quebec families;
That it undertake to maintain the financial support program for community day care centers and to ensure the sustainability of the funds allocated to it. &quot;
The MP points out that the well-being of families has always been at the heart of the Parti Québécois&#39; commitment. Our government was also firmly committed to significantly increasing the funding of community organizations by $ 162 million, of which $ 5 million was intended for those working with families. Unfortunately, the Liberal government has decided to break with this commitment, ignoring the dire needs of community organizations.
“More than 200 organizations offer drop-in daycare services to people in great need. Among other things, these services allow parents to take training, look for a job, or newcomers to take francization courses and thus increase their capacity for integration. Having voted in favor of the motion, the government must now walk the talk and clearly support the organizations, ”concluded the member for Terrebonne.
