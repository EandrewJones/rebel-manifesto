Montreal - The Parti Québécois candidate in Taschereau, Agnès Maltais, denounces the attempt to intimidate the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party, Philippe Couillard, against Pauline Marois.
Indeed, the leader of the Liberal Party said this morning: “I am a lot tougher than the world thinks. I do not let myself do it. […] If Mme Marois chooses that, she will taste it too. &quot;
“Philippe Couillard makes remarks that are unworthy of a party leader who aspires to be prime minister. These are threats. Pauline Marois is a woman who has always respected her opponents. The leader of the Liberal Party is trying to silence her. He refuses to be asked legitimate questions, which are nevertheless in the headlines. He uses unacceptable, unworthy, even coarse language, ”said Agnès Maltais.
“At the very least, the leader of the Liberal Party must apologize for making such comments and withdraw his words. He absolutely has to change his tone, ”she added.
“The question that arises, concluded the candidate in Taschereau, is: what is so threatening for the leader of the PLQ that he slips to this point and tries to intimidate the first minister? &quot;
