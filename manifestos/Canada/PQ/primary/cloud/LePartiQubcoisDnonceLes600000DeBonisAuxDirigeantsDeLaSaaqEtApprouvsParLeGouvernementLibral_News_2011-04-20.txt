Quebec - The MNA for Gouin and official opposition spokesperson for transport, Nicolas Girard, vigorously denounces the large bonuses granted to themselves by the senior executives of the Société de l&#39;assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ) in over the past year. “The senior executives of the SAAQ are paying themselves bonuses on the backs of motorists and motorcyclists and the Liberal government is complicit in this maneuver. It&#39;s scandalous, ”denounced Nicolas Girard.
The member for Gouin revealed to the National Assembly today that over the past year, senior executives have awarded themselves $ 600,000 in bonuses. However, the SAAQ is still in the red because of the historic losses of $ 40 billion of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.
This culture of bonuses at the SAAQ is not surprising; what is, however, is the support of Transport Minister Sam Hamad and that his government perpetuate this culture. “Last year, the former Minister of Transport, Julie Boulet, said that she found the bonuses at the SAAQ unacceptable, exaggerated, abusive and inappropriate and took the phone to tell the president of the board of directors that she was shocked. She was taken so seriously! », Quipped Mr. Girard.
The official opposition is asking Minister Sam Hamad to stop this practice of bonuses at the SAAQ. &quot;It&#39;s time for motorists and motorcyclists to be respected and to stop bailing for bad decisions by the SAAQ, including the shameless waste for more luxurious and spacious offices at the head office at a cost of $ 42 million. », Concluded Nicolas Girard.
