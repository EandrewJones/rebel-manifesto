Quebec - The deputy for Bonaventure, Sylvain Roy, pointed out today in the National Assembly that more than 9,500 people mobilized to denounce the effects of liberal austerity in the Gaspé. In the presence of the member for Taillon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of health and access to care, Diane Lamarre, he added his voice to that of the initiators of a petition calling on the Liberal government to cancel the cuts. in order to maintain access to health care and its quality.
“The Minister of Health can no longer claim that his cuts of $ 450 million this year in the network do not affect access to care and services. In the Gaspé, austerity in health has resulted in cuts of $ 22 million. More specifically, 10 of the 24 surgical beds were closed at Maria Hospital, and 12 nursing assistants positions were cut. At the Saint-Joseph residence, a nursing assistant position has been abolished. At the New Carlisle CHSLD, there is now only one day nurse to take care of 72 residents with a very serious loss of autonomy, ”Sylvain Roy denounced.
“The minister is the only one to believe himself when he says that the liberal cuts do not affect access to care. Here are other examples: the mobile breast cancer screening service was abolished in the Gaspé, when it had allowed 355 women to have access to a screening test last year, and the urology service finds himself without a doctor and will no longer be available in the Baie-des-Chaleurs sector. The minister refused to guarantee citizens that these services will be restored and that the cuts will stop; it is unacceptable, ”added Diane Lamarre.
“While the Minister of Health is giving hundreds of millions to his medical colleagues, he is cutting back on the essential, namely the health and safety of Gaspésiens. It is simply dangerous, and it must stop! », Concluded the deputies.
