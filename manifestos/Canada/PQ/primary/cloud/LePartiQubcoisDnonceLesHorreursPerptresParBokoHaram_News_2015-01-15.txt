Quebec - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for international relations and the status of women, Carole Poirier, strongly condemns the terrorist acts perpetrated by the Boko Haram group and hopes that the governments of the world, particularly those in Quebec and Canada, pay more attention to these unacceptable actions.
“On January 3, the terrorist group razed several villages in northeastern Nigeria, killing scores of people. According to Amnesty International, this is the group&#39;s largest and most destructive offensive since the Islamist insurgency in 2009. To this must be added the numerous kidnappings and attacks, as well as all the destruction that Boko Haram has caused. left behind in recent years. This situation is beyond all understanding. The international community must take a serious look at this large-scale humanitarian tragedy, ”said Carole Poirier.
The member adds that unfortunately women are used by Boko Haram as weapons of war. “Not only does the group reject education for young girls, it has also carried out several major kidnappings. More abominable still, young girls, only 10 years old, are used as human bombs. This new escalation in horror must be vigorously denounced, just like the terrorist acts of Boko Haram ”, she concluded.
