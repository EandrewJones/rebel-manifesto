Quebec - The member for Taschereau and official opposition spokesperson for secularism, Agnès Maltais, as well as the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, denounce the remarks of the Imam Hamza Chaoui and want the authorities to do what is necessary to prevent the imam opening in Montreal of a community center run by him.
“Imam Hamza Chaoui has made radical statements in the past; he notably asserted that democracy and Islam are not compatible, and that voting is a sin. We strongly denounce these medieval remarks ”, declared Agnès Maltais.
“I support the municipal authorities in their efforts to verify the compatibility of a community center run by this imam with the environment. His comments on the place that women and homosexuals should occupy in our society are incompatible with our values, in particular with the absolute value of equality between men and women, ”added Carole Poirier.
The limits of Couillard&#39;s &quot;logic&quot;
The case of Hamza Chaoui illustrates well the limits of the reasoning of Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, who considers that fundamentalism is a “personal choice” like any other. &quot;For the Prime Minister, is it acceptable for an individual to speak out and promote discriminatory and anti-democratic values?&quot; », Asked Agnès Maltais.
An observatory on religious fundamentalism: a necessity
The relevance of the creation of an observatory on religious fundamentalism is demonstrated by this story. “We hope that the government will side with our proposal to create an observatory on religious fundamentalism; it is essential to understand, document and prevent radicalism and fundamentalism, ”concluded the member for Taschereau.
