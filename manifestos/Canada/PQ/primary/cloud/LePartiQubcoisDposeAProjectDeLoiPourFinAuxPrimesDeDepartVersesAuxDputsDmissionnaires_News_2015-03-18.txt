Quebec - The member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for ethics and integrity, Stéphane Bergeron, today presented a bill aimed at ending the granting of a bonus to resigning deputies. He asks the government to seize it quickly, so that harmful situations, such as the one experienced when Yves Bolduc left, cease.
“The departure of Yves Bolduc eloquently demonstrated the need to put an end, definitively, to this practice which consists, for a deputy who has run for and obtained a democratic mandate, to pocket a bonus if he decides to not to carry out this mandate. Our fellow citizens overwhelmingly disapprove of this behavior, which obviously contributes to growing cynicism in our society, ”declared Stéphane Bergeron.
Remember that this is the third time in two years that a Liberal MP has left during his mandate by collecting his transition allowance, while Elaine Zakaïb, from the Parti Québécois, and Christian Dubé, from the CAQ, have renounced it. . “The Liberal government is trying to distract attention from the scandalous behavior of its former members by shaking up the L&#39;Heureux-Dubé report, which also contains a multitude of other recommendations. This is clearly a maneuver aimed at avoiding tackling without delay the main problem, that of severance bonuses unduly affected by members who have resigned from the Liberal Party. There is an urgent need to act, ”continued the member for Verchères.
“The bill we have introduced today is simple, clear and concise. It can easily be passed on a very short notice if the government has the will. We are thus giving the Prime Minister an opportunity to show leadership and consistency with what he said just a few weeks ago; I dare not doubt that he will be able to seize it, ”concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
