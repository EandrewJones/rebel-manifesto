Québec, October 28, 2014 - Diane Lamarre, the member for Saint-Jean, Dave Turcotte, and the member for Taillon and official opposition spokesperson for health and access to care, ask the Minister of Health and Social Services, Gaétan Barrette, to finally listen to the citizens of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, who signed a petition to ask for the revision of the cutback plan and the cancellation of the job cuts at the CSSS Haut-Richelieu –Rouville. During a press briefing on this subject held today, the deputies were accompanied by Ms. Line Larocque, first vice-president of the Interprofessional Health Federation of Quebec (FIQ), and Ms. Sylvie Jovin, President of the Union Haut-Richelieu – Rouville (FIQ) health professionals. “What the minister calls reorganization turns out to be service cuts. In fact, he made the citizens of Montérégie, and more specifically those of Haut-Richelieu, suffer the consequences of liberal austerity. With us, 82 professional positions are cut, in addition to the closure of 8 beds in the pediatric unit, 32 beds in the medicine unit and 2 intensive care beds. These cuts will directly affect services to the population, the quality of care as well as the level of safety in which it is provided, ”said the member for Saint-Jean. The Member for Taillon recalls for her part that even if Minister Gaétan Barrette has repeatedly stated that the cuts imposed by his government on the health network would not affect care and services, obviously, this is not what is happening on the ground. &quot; This is unacceptable. He is not listening to the people and continues to ignore the demonstrations that take place every week in the four corners of Quebec to denounce the liberal cuts and austerity. The members of the Parti Québécois support the citizens of Haut-Richelieu and ask the minister to cancel these cuts, just as he canceled those for intellectual disabilities in Montreal two weeks ago, ”added Diane Lamarre.
