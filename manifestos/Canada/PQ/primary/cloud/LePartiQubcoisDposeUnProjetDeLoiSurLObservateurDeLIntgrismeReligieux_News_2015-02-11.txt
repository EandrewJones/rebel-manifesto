Quebec - The member for Taschereau, parliamentary leader of the official opposition and spokesperson for secularism, Agnès Maltais, tabled a bill on the observer of religious fundamentalism.
“The mission of the observer will be to identify and document manifestations of religious fundamentalism in Quebec, with the aim of preventing radicalization, in particular that of our young people. Its mandate will also be to study phenomena and issues such as religious accommodation, religious neutrality, state secularism as well as intolerance towards religious minorities, often the first victims of fundamentalism. To do this, the observer will conduct research. It will also have investigative powers. In this sense, its mandate will be similar to that of the Québec Ombudsman; it drafts reports and issues recommendations to parliamentarians, who have them, ”said Agnès Maltais.
The observer will report to the National Assembly. He will be appointed by two-thirds of the votes of the deputies. The observer will report on his activities, and the bill provides that the deputies of the National Assembly will have to take up these reports.
“The observer will allow elected members of the National Assembly to have a clear and complete portrait of the issue of religious fundamentalism as defined by the Bouchard-Taylor commission. In our view, this is necessary if we are to choose the best methods to prevent the radicalization of individuals at risk and to protect communities from stigmatization. Independent experts, such as those participating in the Observatory on Radicalization and Violent Extremism, announced yesterday, will thus be able to obtain mandates from the observer to better understand religious fundamentalism, to document it and to prevent it, ”concluded Agnès. Maltese.
Watch the parliamentary capsule on the liberal unrest surrounding our project.
