Québec– The Member for Vachon and official opposition spokesperson for the electrification of transport, Martine Ouellet, this morning tabled in the National Assembly Bill 392, An Act respecting motor vehicles in zero greenhouse gas emissions, the purpose of which is to improve the supply of electric vehicles on the Quebec market and, in so doing, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
“Automobile manufacturers must increase the supply of electric vehicles, in particular by offering Quebec consumers a wider range of models. Given the weakness of the current supply, sales of electric vehicles represent just over 0.5% of all car sales in Quebec. If adopted, our bill will position Quebec as a leader in electric mobility, ”said Martine Ouellet.
Ten US states, representing more than 28% of the US auto market, have already passed zero emissions legislation, including California and New York. These states can therefore benefit from a better offer in terms of electric vehicles and a better environment.
“The transportation sector is responsible for 45% of greenhouse gas emissions in Quebec. The electrification of transportation is essential if we want to free Quebec from oil and fight climate change. When we were in government, we tabled an ambitious transportation electrification strategy; unfortunately, the Liberals are abandoning it, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault, official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and the environment.
“In terms of operating costs, owners of an electric vehicle save up to 85% compared to owners of a gasoline vehicle. In addition, rather than using oil imported at great expense from abroad, they buy Quebec green electricity; the savings thus achieved can be invested locally and, consequently, create wealth in Quebec, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
