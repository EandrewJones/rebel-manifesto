Québec, October 21, 2014 - The member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for ethics and integrity, Stéphane Bergeron, today tabled in the National Assembly a motion calling for the abolition of the bonus program for physicians for the care of patients.
“Due to lack of time, during its General Council, the Liberal Party was unable to take a position on a resolution from the activists of Montérégie-Center, moreover region of the Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette. The resolution called for the abolition of the physician bonus program. Today we are giving the Liberal parliamentary wing the opportunity to make its position known in this regard, ”said Stéphane Bergeron.
The motion reads as follows:
“That the National Assembly demand the abolition of the program of bonuses to physicians for the management of patients, as proposed by the Regional Policy Commission of Montérégie-Center of the Liberal Party of Quebec. &quot;
Reimbursement or resignation The deputy reiterates that Minister Yves Bolduc has the choice: to reimburse his entire bonus of $ 215,000 or resign from his post.
“Yves Bolduc withdrew $ 215,000 from a program he himself had set up, while diverting the very spirit of the bonus. Indeed, while it aims to encourage family doctors to take more patients in charge, the minister has abandoned hundreds of them. This is unacceptable! », Concluded the deputy.
It should be remembered that the Liberal parliamentary wing also defended without nuance the payment of bonuses to Dr. Bolduc during a vote on a motion by the PQ opposition on September 17.
