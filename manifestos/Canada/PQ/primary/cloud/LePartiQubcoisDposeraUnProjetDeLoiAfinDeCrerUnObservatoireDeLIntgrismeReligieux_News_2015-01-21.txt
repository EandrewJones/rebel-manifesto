Québec - The member for Taschereau, parliamentary leader of the official opposition and spokesperson for secularism, Agnès Maltais, announces that the Parti Québécois will table, at the start of the parliamentary term, a bill proposing the creation of an observatory of religious fundamentalism.
“We suggest an observatory in order to have a clear and complete portrait of the issue of religious fundamentalism. In our view, this is necessary to prevent radicalization of individuals at risk and to protect communities from stigma. Independent experts will thus be able to obtain data to better understand religious fundamentalism, to document it and to prevent it. Prime Minister Philippe Couillard himself proposed to treat religious fundamentalism and state neutrality separately; by introducing this bill, we are taking it at its word. Our intention to debate this issue is known to all, and it is now up to the government to hear our call, ”said Agnès Maltais.
In addition, in terms of education, the caucus of members of the Parti Québécois made two demands of the government:
Finally, the official opposition is calling for the tabling, as soon as possible, of a bill on the religious neutrality of the State and equality between men and women.
“Obviously, the question of the religious neutrality of the State causes a major unease within the government, in particular for Philippe Couillard. However, the latter must fulfill his electoral promise and make a proposal to ensure respect for it in Quebec, as well as for equality between men and women, ”concluded Agnès Maltais.
