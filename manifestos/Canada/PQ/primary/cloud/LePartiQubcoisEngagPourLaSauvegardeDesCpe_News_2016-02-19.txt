Quebec– The Parti Québécois family spokesperson, Sylvain Pagé, participated this morning in a large human chain in support of childcare centers in the Mont-Laurier region. He thus responded to the invitation of the CPE La Fourmilière and the CPE Les Vers à Choux, who organized this mobilization activity to denounce the impact of the $ 120 million cuts that will befall childcare centers this year.
“With the arrival of a new Minister for Families, we would have expected more listening, more openness. Unfortunately, Sébastien Proulx serves us the same tape as his predecessor. If the Minister is really listening to parents and educators, as he claims, well, let him prove it by renouncing the $ 120 million cuts that his government wants to make in the network, ”declared Sylvain Pagé. .
“By cutting childcare centers, the minister is undermining equal opportunities. It abandons children, families and educators across Quebec. It sacrifices a network which has proven itself for years and which has enabled thousands of mothers to enter the labor market, and thousands of children with special needs to have a place in daycare ”, added the spokesperson.
“The Minister of Families must provide the means for childcare centers to pursue their educational, screening and prevention mission. As for the Parti Québécois, we will continue to fight alongside parents and educators. With the new &quot;family tax&quot;, for which parents will have to pay up to $ 2300 per child when filing their income tax return, next month, we understand that the new vision of the Liberal government is &quot;pay more for less service &quot;. Indecent! ”Sylvain Pagé concluded.
