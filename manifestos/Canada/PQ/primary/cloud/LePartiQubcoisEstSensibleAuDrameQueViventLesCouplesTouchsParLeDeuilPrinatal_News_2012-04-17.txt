Quebec - Sensitive to the tragedy that couples experience when a baby dies before the end of a pregnancy, the member for Iberville and official opposition spokesperson for families, Marie Bouillé, and the member d&#39;Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Carole Poirier, show openness to find a solution so that the father is entitled to treatment equivalent to that of the mother in such circumstances.
A petition containing the signatures of more than 12,000 people asking that paternity leave be increased during perinatal mourning was tabled in the National Assembly today by the Member of Parliament for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
“Thanks to Marie-Pierre Dubé and Kunthy Chhim, citizens of my riding, I learned a few weeks ago that neither the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan nor the Act respecting labor standards provided for adequate measures to allow couples to benefit from a common respite time to mourn the loss of a child. This situation touched me deeply, ”said Carole Poirier, explaining why she had agreed to submit this petition.
Indeed, although maternity leave is provided for mothers, it is only a few days without pay that are currently granted to fathers. “The unexpected and unwanted end of a pregnancy is a disturbing event that affects both father and mother. Both members of the couple should be entitled to an adequate period of respite in order to cope with their mourning, ”added Marie Bouillé.
The Parti Québécois is committed to finding a solution to correct this situation if it is brought to power in the next election.
