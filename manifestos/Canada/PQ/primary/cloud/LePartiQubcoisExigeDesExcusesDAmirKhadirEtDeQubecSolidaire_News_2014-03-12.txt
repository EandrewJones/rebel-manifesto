Montreal - Following his remarks comparing the candidacy of Pierre Karl Péladeau to the visit of Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran, the Parti Québécois demands from the candidate of Quebec solidaire in Mercier, Amir Khadir, that he apologize publicly for his inflammatory, deceptive and irresponsible words.
The Parti Québécois also asks Françoise David to dissociate himself from the remarks of his candidate and to call him to order.
Indeed, in a report on the program Le 15-18 of the Première Chaîne de Radio-Canada, Amir Khadir compares the arrival of Pierre Karl Péladeau to the Parti Québécois to the alliance of the Iranian left and the right which aimed to overthrow American rule and to bring Ayatollah Khomeini to the head of the country. However, the Iranian Revolution, it should be remembered, ended with the establishment of a dictatorial regime in which individual freedoms were continually flouted.
By his words, Amir Khadir discredits himself, as well as his party.
