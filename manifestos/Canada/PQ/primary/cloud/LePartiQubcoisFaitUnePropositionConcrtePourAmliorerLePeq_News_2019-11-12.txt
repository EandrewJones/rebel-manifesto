Québec, November 12, 2019 - Méganne Perry Mélançon, the member for Gaspé and the Parti Québécois immigration spokesperson, today proposed, during question period, a concrete solution to the government to improve the Program d Quebec experience (PEQ). In his view, after the retreat imposed by the Prime Minister on Simon Jolin-Barrette, the government must now seek to improve the PEQ, rather than restrict its scope.
IN SHORT
· The government should look for ways to improve the PEQ, rather than restricting it; one solution would be to extend its scope to DEP.
· Often, eligible students are already fully integrated and wish to remain in the regions.
· The PEQ can and must become the tool par excellence for the regionalization of immigration.
“Friday, the Prime Minister put an end to the week of muddle of the CAQ on the PEQ. Now we have to look at how the program can be improved. I propose to the government a simple and ideal solution: remove the restrictions provided for, and extend the PEQ to vocational studies diplomas, the DEP ”, proposed Méganne Perry Mélançon.
According to the Parti Québécois, the Jolin-Barrette reform was a mistake as a whole, particularly for remote regions. &quot;Students eligible for the PEQ are the best candidates for immigration that we can hope for: they are trained, speak French, are already integrated and often wish to settle in the regions,&quot; continued the spokesperson.
The Minister of Immigration, Francization and Integration, Simon Jolin-Barrette, said he wanted to regionalize immigration by supervising newcomers with officials. “Without this being a bad thing in itself, in terms of integration, the supervision by a civil servant is much less effective. The Minister must understand that it is easier, more efficient and more economical to welcome a person who is already integrated into his community. What is more, it absolutely must make the PEQ the cornerstone of its immigration regionalization plan; otherwise, it will be a bitter failure, ”concluded the member.
