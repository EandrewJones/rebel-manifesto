Québec, June 10, 2020 - Véronique Hivon, the member for Joliette and the Parti Québécois family spokesperson, is very pleased to have unanimously adopted, with the collaboration of the three other parliamentary groups, a motion providing for the introduction of parental leave for members of the National Assembly, no later than next December.
IN SHORT
“All political parties recognize the importance of the family challenges posed by the work of an MP. In terms of family-work balance in Parliament, it is time to finally move from words to deeds; this is a message all the more essential given that we want a National Assembly representative of Quebec society, with a large number of women and young people for whom this issue can be decisive in the choice of whether or not to run for politics. It is therefore simply a matter of allowing women and men holding the office of Member of Parliament to be treated in a similar manner to other citizens, ”explained Véronique Hivon.
“The Montreal City Council, the House of Commons as well as several parliamentary assemblies elsewhere in the world offer parental leave to their members. I am proud to see Quebec follow suit and finally reflect the family reality of the 21st century, with all the challenges it entails, whether you are an MP or not, ”she added.
The motion, as adopted, reads as follows:
&quot;That the National Assembly affirm its desire to establish parental leave for Members of Parliament and that this principle be recognized in the Act respecting the conditions of employment and the pension plan for members of the National Assembly and the Code of ethics and ethics of members of the National Assembly.
That the Office of the National Assembly entrust the responsibility of determining the specific modalities to the Independent Committee for Determining the Working Conditions of Deputies, which will have to make it a priority mandate, so that it can be put in place at the latest. in December 2020. &quot;
