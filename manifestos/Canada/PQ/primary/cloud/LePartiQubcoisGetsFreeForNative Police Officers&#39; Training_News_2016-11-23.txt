Quebec– Alexandre Cloutier, Parti Québécois spokesperson for education, school perseverance, Aboriginal affairs and northern communities, is delighted to have obtained from the government the assurance that it will reimburse in the future , costs related to the training of aboriginal police officers.
It should be remembered that in recent years, students registered for the Attestation of Collegial Studies (AEC) in police techniques (First Nations) had to pay admission fees of $ 17,500, to which was added an invoice of $ 34,000 to the when you register with the École nationale de police du Québec.
“Native students had to pay over $ 50,000 for training in policing techniques. However, neither the Minister responsible for Higher Education nor the Minister of Native Affairs knew about it. I had to ask a question in the National Assembly for the government to start taking an interest in the training of native police officers, ”the spokesperson stressed.
It is indeed thanks to this question asked in the House last Thursday that the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs announced today that he was going to correct the situation. Finally, accessibility to the AEC in police techniques for indigenous youth will be guaranteed.
“It is all the same astonishing to see that the government was not even aware of the sums that these students had to pay, whereas for a year, we have only been talking about the relations between the police forces and the aboriginal communities. If we had not intervened, the Liberals probably would have allowed this situation to continue. Training aboriginal police officers is a big part of the solution. The government must first ensure accessibility, then reimburse students who have overpaid in recent years, ”concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
