Quebec City - Following the death a few days ago of former Quebec Party MP Jean Alfred, Saint-Jérôme MP and leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, wished to express his sympathy to his relatives. Martine Ouellet, MP for Vachon, and Maka Kotto, MP for Bourget, attended the funeral of Mr Alfred, who was also, among other things, a teacher and councilor in Gatineau.
“In my name, as well as that of the members of Parliament and the great family of the Parti Québécois, I extend my most sincere condolences to the family and friends of Jean Alfred. An indefatigable worker, he was a real man of action, totally devoted to his citizens. I also salute the free thinker he was, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
Last Saturday, during Mr. Alfred&#39;s funeral, many recalled his tenacity, his commitment and his desire to make Quebec a country for all. “We will remember Jean Alfred for a long time, especially because of the intense struggle he waged for social justice. For him, everyone was on an equal footing; It didn&#39;t matter if you were rich or poor, woman or man, young or old, from here or elsewhere. In his mind, everyone had a right to happiness, and this conviction has driven him throughout his life, ”said Martine Ouellet.
For his part, Maka Kotto recalled how Jean Alfred could be a model, an inspiration, not only for members of the Haitian community in Quebec, but also for all newcomers. “He forged a path that many others have taken. Following his example, many women and men who came to settle in Quebec have managed to find a place of their own. First black elected to the National Assembly of Quebec, Jean Alfred demonstrated that the origins of a person should not in any way slow down his ambitions, ”he declared.
Among the achievements of Jean Alfred, let us mention his role in the creation of the hospital and the airport of Gatineau, as well as in the file of the extension of highway 50.
