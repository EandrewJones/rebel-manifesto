Quebec– The member for Terrebonne and official opposition spokesperson for families, Mathieu Traversy, invites the population to sign a large number of petitions to uphold Quebec&#39;s family policy, an initiative of the Association québécoise early childhood centers (AQCPE) sponsored by the deputy.
“We may wonder what the families of Quebec did to the Liberal government to get it so badly on them. The cuts resulting from its austerity policy are hurting families. The Minister of Families, Francine Charbonneau, initially delayed the development of thousands of childcare spaces. The government is also working on a &quot;family tax&quot;, by which the middle class will pay even more. As if that were not enough, he also wants to put the ax on parental insurance, ”said Mathieu Traversy.
The Member points out that our family policy is an important jewel to be preserved for the economic and social development of Quebec.
“These are progressive social measures that have moved Quebec forward. They are essential elements for the development of our society, a vital support for young families, and there is no question of dismantling them in the name of a short-sighted accounting exercise. By offering support to young parents, we allow them to better reconcile family life and work, to participate fully in society, ”concluded Mathieu Traversy.
The petition is posted on the website of the National Assembly at http://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/exprimez-votre-opinion/petition/Petition-4833/index.html
