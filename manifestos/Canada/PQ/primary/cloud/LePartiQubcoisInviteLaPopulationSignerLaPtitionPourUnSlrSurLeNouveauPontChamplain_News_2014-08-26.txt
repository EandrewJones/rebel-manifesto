Québec– Martine Ouellet, MP for Vachon and official opposition spokesperson for transport, transportation electrification and maritime strategy, and Jean-François Lisée, MP for Rosemont and spokesperson for the Metropolis , invite citizens to sign the petition asking the Government of Quebec to take a stand in favor of a light rail system (SLR) as a mode of public transportation on the new Champlain Bridge. This is available on the website of the National Assembly.
“Last spring, the Minister of Transport, Robert Poëti, began to step backwards in the file and at the same time renounced the Liberal commitment for an SLR. By doing so, it goes against the consensus of the many elected officials of the South Shore and Montreal, ”said Martine Ouellet.
“Citizen mobilization remains essential to safeguard this project, which is so important for the Metropolis and the South Shore. I invite the population to sign this petition in large numbers, ”added Jean-François Lisée.
Remember that a report by the firm AECOM, commissioned by the Agence métropolitaine de transport, confirms that the SLR is the only means of transport that will meet needs after 2021, thus outclassing rapid bus systems. Despite several requests from the Parti Québécois, Minister Poëti still refuses to make this study public.
Citizens have until November 22, 2014 to sign the petition at: assnat.qc.ca/fr/exprimez-votre-opinion/petition/petition-4793/index.html.
