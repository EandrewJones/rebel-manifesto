Montreal - The Parti Québécois launched today, on its social media, its new training school. This School will constitute a new platform where activists and sympathizers of the sovereignist political formation will be able to interact in order to consult a media library linked to the independence of Quebec as well as to register for training courses dealing with the organization and the political communication.
“We will be ready for the next electoral meeting. The Parti Québécois Training School is part of the range of new tools available to Parti Québécois activists. We will have in hand everything that is necessary to show voters that the only real option to allow Quebec to fully succeed is the Parti Québécois, ”declared the Director General of the Parti Québécois, Alain Lupien.
The Training School will offer and improve a page for the general public where lectures and documentation on independence will be presented to all those interested in the project to make Quebec a country. It is also possible to register to consult the training offer.
