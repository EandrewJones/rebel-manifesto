Quebec City, February 14, 2017– The Leader of the Official Opposition, Jean-François Lisée, and the Parti Québécois transport spokesperson, Alain Therrien, today unveiled how many families in more than 50 municipalities in the metropolitan region will have to pay for the Metropolitan Electricity Network (REM), in addition to the costs incurred by the reform of the Metropolitan Regional Transport Authority.
“The government promised that the government of Quebec and the municipalities would not subsidize the REM. However, not only are there subsidies paid directly from the pockets of taxpayers but, in addition, they will be added to the new tax 450 imposed on families in the Montreal region. What is the Liberal government&#39;s strategy? Not talking about the additional costs or the financial package before the contracts are given and the construction of the REM begins? », Asked Jean-François Lisée.
&quot;We are in favor of this major public transit project,&quot; the leader of the official opposition also recalled. We are simply asking for transparency for citizens. We are asking the government to commit to ensuring that the REM does not result in any tax increase for families in Montreal and 450. ”
Here is how much the bill amounts to, per year, for a typical family (2 adults, 2 children):
Essential parliamentary committee
“Today, families in the metropolitan area are learning that they will have to spend significant additional sums, on top of the already considerable costs of the austerity of the Liberal government of Philippe Couillard. In addition, many questions remain about the financial package and the implementation of the REM project. Despite everything, the Liberals persist in refusing to hold a parliamentary committee where everyone could be heard and where the facts could be explained to the people. The government must hold this parliamentary commission, ”added Alain Therrien.
