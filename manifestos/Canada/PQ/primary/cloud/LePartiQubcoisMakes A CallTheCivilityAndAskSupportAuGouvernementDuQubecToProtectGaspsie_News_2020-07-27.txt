Gaspé, July 27, 2020 - The Member of Parliament for Gaspé, Méganne Perry Mélançon, makes another general appeal for civility to vacationers who choose the Gaspé peninsula this summer. In recent weeks, there has been a massive influx of tourists without reservations who occupy spaces not fitted out for camping. This situation causes problems of sanitation, coexistence with the citizens of the region and too crowded gatherings during a pandemic. The member therefore makes three requests to the Government of Quebec to try to regularize the situation:
- A visit by the Minister of Public Security on the Gaspé territory to appeal for civility and remind the rules;
- A special budget to find more Sûreté du Québec patrollers for the summer season, allow the most targeted municipalities to hire security guards and increase the posting of municipal by-laws;
- Special monitoring of the beaches to prevent them from becoming a place of accommodation.
Quebec must offer formal support to send a strong message to offending tourists. We are therefore asking for concrete support for municipalities to apply the regulations in force. The stakes are high, the tourist season will continue for several more weeks and local resources are too limited to allow us to ensure respect for our territory.
“Our region is one of the most beautiful in the world and we are always happy to introduce it to tourists from all over. However, this year, we are experiencing an unprecedented situation that requires us to intervene. In addition to making it difficult to coexist with the fragile ecosystems of the beaches of Gaspésie, we find ourselves with public places filled with dirt that comes to ruin our magnificent landscapes. This situation must be taken seriously by Quebec ”, underlines the elected Gaspé.
She recalls that the tourism industry is of great importance to the Gaspé economy. “It is a richness to live in such a beautiful territory and we share it with all of our fellow Quebecers. By recalling the rules of respect for the territory and its inhabitants, we do honor to our region. Everyone wins, but everyone must do their part ”.
