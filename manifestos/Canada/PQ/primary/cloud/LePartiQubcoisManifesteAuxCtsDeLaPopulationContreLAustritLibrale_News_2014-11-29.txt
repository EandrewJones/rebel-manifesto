Quebec - The member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, participates with many members in the march against austerity held today in Quebec. Several of his fellow members of the Parti Québécois do the same in Montreal.
“The government only has austerity to offer Quebecers. The Liberal effect is the loss of 82,000 full-time jobs since April. This government has no economic development policy to stimulate employment. It cut in the resources dedicated to the socio-economic development of the regions, the CLDs. He proposes a reform of the health network which will in no way improve patient access or care. Rather, it will paralyze the network for years to come, ”said Stéphane Bédard.
“Today, the members of the Parti Québécois are in the streets with the population to tell the Liberal government of Philippe Couillard that austerity is not going away. The measures it puts in place attack families, regions and workers. Philippe Couillard lied to the population during the election campaign when he said he was going to develop the network of childcare services and limit the increase in rates to indexation. However, it modulated the prices and slowed down the creation of places expected by parents everywhere in Quebec. Quebec families are disappointed with these broken promises and worried about what will happen next, ”added the leader of the official opposition.
&quot;We call on the Prime Minister and his government to abandon these austerity measures that are affecting families, regions and workers.&quot; The government broke the bond of trust that bound it to the people; now it&#39;s up to him to repair the damage, ”concluded Stéphane Bédard.
