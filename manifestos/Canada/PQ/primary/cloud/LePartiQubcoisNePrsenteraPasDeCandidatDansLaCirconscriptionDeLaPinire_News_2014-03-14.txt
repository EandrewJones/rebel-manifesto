Longueuil - After consultation with the executive committee of La Pinière, the general management of the Parti Québécois announces that the Parti Québécois will not present a candidate in this constituency in order to promote the re-election of the independent candidate Fatima Houda-Pepin.
The charter of secularism is a central piece of legislation for the Parti Québécois. A forthcoming Parti Québécois government is committed to re-tabling the charter of secularism and equality between men and women so that it can finally be adopted.
“This is a carefully considered decision that we have come to. The courage and commitment shown by Fatima Houda-Pepin in the debate on the charter are to her credit. I would particularly like to underline his perseverance in the fight against religious fundamentalism, ”declared Bernard Drainville, Parti Québécois candidate in Marie-Victorin and Minister responsible for Democratic Institutions and Citizen Participation.
Recall that Ms. Houda-Pepin was expelled from the liberal caucus because she supported a more rigorous defense of the principles of religious neutrality of the State, contrary to the status quo position defended by Philippe Couillard. Moreover, the Parti Québécois was inspired by the work and ideas of Fatima Houda-Pepin to integrate into its platform the establishment of a research center on so-called honor crimes and the fight against fundamentalism.
“It is not an easy fight that the candidate in La Pinière has undertaken. She defends with courage and dedication the values of equality between men and women and the secularism of the State to which a large majority of Quebecers adhere. On behalf of the Parti Québécois, I wish him the best of luck, ”concluded Mr. Drainville.
