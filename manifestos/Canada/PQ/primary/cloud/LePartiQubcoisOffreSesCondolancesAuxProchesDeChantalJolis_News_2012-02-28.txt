Quebec - The Parti Québécois offers its most sincere condolences to the two sons, grandchildren, family and all those close to host and journalist Chantal Jolis, who died in the last hours of Parkinson&#39;s disease.
“As soon as she arrived in Quebec in 1980 as part of an exchange with Canadian and French public radio stations, she immediately won over Quebec audiences with her colleague Jean-François Doré at the helm of the program Bouchés doubles. Many listeners will confirm having discovered the pleasure of radio by listening to this animated program with intelligence, passion and with a completely new radio tone. A whole generation of listeners is in mourning today, ”declared the Leader of the Official Opposition and Member of Parliament for Charlevoix, Pauline Marois.
“Chantal Jolis will also have marked the Quebec television universe by participating, in 1986, in the creation of Télévision Quatre-Saisons. Like many of us, who came from all over the world, she made Quebec her adopted country and leaves us a legacy of a beautiful bond that will have lasted for thirty years with her many and loyal listeners, both at the radio than on television, ”added the member for Bourget and official opposition spokesperson for culture and communications, Maka Kotto.
