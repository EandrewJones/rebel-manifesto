Quebec - At the initiative of a 13-year-old student from Académie Les Estacades high school in Mauricie, particularly worried about the scourge of violence in schools, the MNA for Champlain, Noëlla Champagne, is sponsoring a petition calling for from the Liberal government an effective action plan to better fight bullying in schools.
“This phenomenon of bullying at school is of great concern to us as elected members of the National Assembly, but also concerns young people, regardless of whether they are victims or witnesses of acts of bullying. It is together, collectively, that we will succeed in stemming this growing scourge, as long as the government admits that the situation is worsening, ”declared Noëlla Champagne.
The member for Champlain was particularly touched when she was approached some time ago by the young student Émanuelle Desprès. “Our young people want to learn in an environment conducive to academic success, free from any act of intimidation. Everything must be done to offer them a serene place to learn and socialize with each other, without being constantly on their guard, especially when we know the disastrous consequences that this intimidation can sometimes lead to, ”added Noëlla Champagne.
The deadline to sign the electronic petition on the website of the National Assembly is February 9, 2012. “The Liberal government&#39;s action plan against bullying in schools is a failure, described as an empty shell by the stakeholders. Thus, we invite everyone, school leaders, teachers, parents, young people, to sign this petition. Let us unite our voice and our efforts to make the Liberal government and its Minister of Education, Line Beauchamp, understand the importance of presenting a new action plan quickly, ”concluded the Member for Jonquière and spokesperson for the official opposition in primary and secondary education, Sylvain Gaudreault.
