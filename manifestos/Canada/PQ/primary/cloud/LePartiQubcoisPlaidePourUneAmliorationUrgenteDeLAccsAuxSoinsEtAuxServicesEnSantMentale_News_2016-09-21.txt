Quebec - The member for Taillon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of health and access to care, Diane Lamarre, will present today in the National Assembly a petition signed by nearly 20,000 people asking for compensation to be paid. internship in psychology, like that of future doctors, specialized nurse practitioners and hospital pharmacists. During a press briefing on this subject, the MP was accompanied by Mr. Eddy Larouche, interim president of the Interuniversity Federation of doctoral students in psychology of Quebec, and Mr. Pierre Blain, director general of the Regroupement provincial des users&#39; committees.
“We lack psychologists in the public network and here we have a measure that would quickly alleviate this shortage, generate better retention of psychologists in the public and, thus, improve access for patients. Quebec is the only place in North America where psychology interns are not remunerated. It is time to put an end to this inequity towards Quebeckers. This remuneration could be linked to a loyalty agreement for a few years and ensure that psychologists remain in the public health system. By next year, we could have some 250 more psychologists. The minister does not seem to see an emergency in mental health; however, the too many cases of suicide remind us that the lack of emergency care and follow-up can have irreversible consequences, ”said the spokesperson.
&quot;We remember that the minister promised to invest $ 70 million to improve access to mental health services and care, but that no amount will be paid before 2018, election year, when the needs are urgent and that untreated problems can worsen and have dramatic consequences. Mental health must become a priority for this government. I urge the Minister of Health to take concrete action that will cost him little and that will generate benefits for the thousands of patients who are waiting, ”concluded Diane Lamarre.
