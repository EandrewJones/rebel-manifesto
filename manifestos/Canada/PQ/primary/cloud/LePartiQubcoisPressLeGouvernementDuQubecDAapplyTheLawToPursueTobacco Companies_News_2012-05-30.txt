Quebec - The Parti Québécois urges the Quebec government to use the Tobacco-related Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act passed three years ago to initiate the legal process provided for in the law.
“Three years ago, the National Assembly unanimously adopted a law to give the government the tools to sue tobacco companies for the health damages created among citizens and which have a huge impact on the health costs of the whole population. The government has had what it takes to act for 153 weeks, it only has three left. It is time to take action now, ”said the member for Taschereau and official opposition critic for health, Agnès Maltais.
The MP was worried to see the government procrastinate, despite the National Assembly having voted for Bill 43 in June 2009. “Legislating is not a piece of cake, it is serious work that we are doing. have an obligation to follow up. Quebec has been preparing its strategy for confronting tobacco companies for more than ten years, like many other jurisdictions in North America. Three weeks before the deadline imposed by law, it is normal to force the Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, to finally proceed, ”continued Agnès Maltais.
According to certain evaluations during the study of the bill in parliamentary committee, Minister Bolduc mentioned that tobacco consumption in Quebec represents a cost of approximately $ 1 billion per year for the health system.
“The idea is not to reinvent the wheel, but to apply a law duly adopted by the National Assembly and which is inspired by what has been done elsewhere. After June 19, it will be too late. It&#39;s urgent, ”concluded Agnès Maltais.
