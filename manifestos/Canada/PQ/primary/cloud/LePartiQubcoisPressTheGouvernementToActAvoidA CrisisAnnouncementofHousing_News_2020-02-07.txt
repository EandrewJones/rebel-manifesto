Quebec, February 7, 2020 - On the sidelines of a large gathering of caravans, a FRAPRU initiative to demand more social housing, the member for Rimouski and Parti Québécois housing spokesperson, Harold LeBel, press the government to act to avoid a new crisis.
IN SHORT
“Recently, I had the chance to meet several groups that work in the housing sector. They are unanimous: if nothing is done, we are heading towards a new housing crisis of great magnitude in Quebec. And, once again, the most vulnerable populations will be the most affected; several seniors, social assistance recipients and other low-wage single-parent women are on the verge of personal tragedy, perhaps even as early as next July, ”the spokesperson warned.
In fact, vacancy rates are alarming: while the normal is 3%, this rate is 2.4% in Quebec City and 2.3% in Sherbrooke. In Montreal and Gatineau, it barely reached 1.5%. “Scarcity forces households to devote an increasing share of their income to housing; for about a third of Quebecers who are tenants, it is more than 30%. For 14% of them, more than half of their salary goes to rent. It has to change, and quickly, ”continued Harold LeBel.
This calls out to the Minister of Housing: “Madame Laforest, we must not live in denial. It&#39;s not going fast enough. The 731 social housing units delivered in 2018-2019 are not enough. FRAPRU estimates that 50,000 should be built in 5 years! We must quickly show leadership and set up a real strategy to build more social housing, so that all Quebecers can find adequate housing, according to their needs and their ability to pay, ”he said. .
