Quebec– Rousseau MNA and Official Opposition Finance and Revenue Critic Nicolas Marceau, as well as Saint-Jean MLA and Employment Critic Dave Turcotte urge the government to act and establish a real job creation strategy.
“Employment is declining in Quebec, while it is increasing in the rest of Canada. In May, 15,800 full-time jobs were lost, while in Canada, if we exclude the effect of the decline in Quebec, 46,700 were created. Quebec has 9,300 new unemployed. The last few weeks have been marked by the announcement of significant losses of quality jobs, notably at Bombardier, Davie and Alcan. What does the government intend to do to reverse the trend? », Asked Nicolas Marceau.
Since the Liberal government came to power, Quebec has contributed only 12.6% of the creation of full-time jobs in Canada, while we represent 23.1% of the population. “The government has no strategy, and it rejected out of hand our proposal to hold a major economic forum. The Liberals must stop improvising and present us with a real economic development policy including concrete measures to stimulate employment, ”added Dave Turcotte.
