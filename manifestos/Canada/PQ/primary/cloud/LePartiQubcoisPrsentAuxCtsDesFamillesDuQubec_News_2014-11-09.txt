Québec, November 9, 2014 - Stéphane Bédard, MP for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, and Mathieu Traversy, MP for Terrebonne and Family Critic, are proud to be present today at Montreal, at the large gathering of the Movement for the Safeguarding of Quebec Family Policy. Members of the Parti Québécois also join their voices to that of thousands of parents who take part in this great gathering in several municipalities of Quebec.
“The Liberal government is attacking the very foundations of Quebec family policy. This policy is however the pride of the population; it serves as a model all over the world. The measures underlying it are very important, they are progressive and have moved Quebec forward. Everywhere, the Liberal government has delayed the development of expected child care spaces. By adjusting the rates for childcare services according to income, it has also decided to impose a family tax, which will particularly affect middle-class families. Philippe Couillard promised, during the election campaign, to limit the rise to inflation; he broke that promise, ”said Stéphane Bédard.
The member for Terrebonne recalls the positive effects of a strong family policy, both socially and economically. “Thanks to this ambitious policy, Quebec has notably enabled parents to reconcile family life and work. Single mothers and fathers have improved their living conditions. Tens of thousands of women have entered the labor market faster. Funding childcare services and support for families is not an expense, it is an investment, it is an economic development measure, ”concluded Mathieu Traversy.
