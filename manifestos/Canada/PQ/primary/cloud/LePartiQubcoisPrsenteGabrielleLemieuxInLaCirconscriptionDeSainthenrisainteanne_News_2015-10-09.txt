Montreal - The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pierre Karl Péladeau, is pleased to announce the candidacy of Gabrielle Lemieux in the by-election in the riding of Saint-Henri-Sainte-Anne.
“These by-elections are an opportunity for Quebeckers to send a strong message to the government of Philippe Couillard: liberal austerity is no. Everywhere in Quebec, and here in Saint-Henri, people are suffering the consequences of the ideological cuts by the PLQ. Today, I want to tell the citizens of Saint-Henri-Sainte-Anne that there are better. The solution to liberal austerity is the Parti Québécois and Gabrielle Lemieux. Ms. Lemieux is a young administrator in the health sector who has been working for several years as a planning officer at the CIUSSS du Center-Ouest-de-l&#39;Île-de-Montréal. Her roots in Saint-Henri-Sainte-Anne run deep and she understands the aspirations and challenges of the people of the riding, ”said the leader of the Parti Québécois.
“It is an honor for me to wear the colors of the Parti Québécois, the colors of my convictions. I deeply love Saint-Henri-Sainte-Anne. Citizens, organizations and businesses have been hit hard by liberal austerity. Saint-Henri-Sainte-Anne is a riding where people help each other, where people value public services, where they always aspire to improve their lot. To do this, we need our public schools, our popular education centers. We need our local development centers and our youth-employment centers. We need to support caregivers and parents of young children who are looking for child care spaces. We need a strong health network at the service of the population. On November 9, the people of Saint-Henri-Sainte-Anne will be able to vote for all of this and I am confident that they will opt for a wind of change, for a more humane way of doing things, ”added Gabrielle Lemieux.
