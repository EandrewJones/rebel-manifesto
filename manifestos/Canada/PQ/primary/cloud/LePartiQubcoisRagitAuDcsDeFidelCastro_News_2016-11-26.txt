Quebec - The leader of the official opposition, Jean-François Lisée, and Stéphane Bergeron, the Parti Québécois spokesperson for international relations, were keen to react to the news of the death of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
“Fidel Castro is one of those figures who shaped the 20th century. In their fight against dictator Fulgencio Batista, Fidel Castro and his companions, in particular Ernesto Che Guevara, originally embodied a hope for freedom and justice. The political regime he shaped in Cuba was certainly more attentive to the needs of the population, especially in education and health, but the promise of freedom gave way to a new form of authoritarianism and a severe repression of freedom of expression ”, first reminded Jean-François Lisée.
“For several decades, Quebeckers have developed privileged relations of friendship and solidarity with Cubans, beyond political considerations. This fraternal bond between our two nations must be increasingly embodied in cultural and commercial exchanges which can only enrich us mutually, ”added Stéphane Bergeron for his part.
“At the time of the death of this outstanding figure, and as he begins a new episode in his history, we are wholeheartedly on the side of the Cuban people,” concluded the leader of the official opposition.
