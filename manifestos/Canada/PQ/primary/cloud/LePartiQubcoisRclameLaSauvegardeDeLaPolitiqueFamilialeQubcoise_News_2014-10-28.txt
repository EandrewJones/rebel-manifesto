Québec, October 28, 2014 - Mathieu Traversy, the member for Terrebonne and official opposition spokesperson for families, announces that he will table a motion tomorrow asking the Liberal government to reiterate its commitment to Québec&#39;s family policy. “What we are seeing from this government are direct attacks on family policy measures. The Minister of Families, Francine Charbonneau, has delayed the development of thousands of childcare spaces eagerly awaited by families. In addition, the government leaves room for doubt and uncertainty over these services, by not denying that it wants to cut the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan. We are told that everything is on the table. Fortunately, the mobilization continues throughout Quebec; families care about their family policy, ”said Mathieu Traversy. The motion reads as follows: “That the National Assembly reiterate its commitment to Quebec family policy; That it urge the government to fully preserve the measures of this policy and to ensure the maintenance of the four pillars of the childcare network: quality, universality, accessibility and development. The official opposition wants all the parties represented in the National Assembly to agree to this motion and for the hoped-for debate to take place. Since the start of the mobilization to safeguard the Always Mad About Our Children? Family policy, initiated by the Association québécoise des CPE on October 22, members of the Parti Québécois have participated in various activities in the regions.
