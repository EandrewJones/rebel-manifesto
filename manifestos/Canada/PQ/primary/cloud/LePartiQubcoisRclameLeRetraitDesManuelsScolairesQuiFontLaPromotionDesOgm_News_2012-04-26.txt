Quebec - The Parti Québécois calls for the withdrawal of textbooks that promote genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
“It is totally absurd that the Ministry of Education authorized such textbooks! Trying to seduce our young people with GMOs under the pretext that they will revolutionize our lives is absolutely laughable and false. It is unacceptable that a manual authorized by the Ministry of Education trivializes GMOs in this way, ”declared the member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for primary and secondary education, Sylvain Gaudreault.
He was shocked to learn yesterday that the Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sport maintains that this decision to approve such textbooks was intended to make students react to progress. “By doing this, the Liberal government is reneging on its own policy on GMOs. Unless he secretly changed his mind, once again, ”continued the member for Jonquière, recalling that the commitment of the Liberal Party of Quebec on GMOs in 2003 has still not been respected nine years more late.
For his part, the member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata and spokesperson for agriculture and food, André Simard, believes that this question of GMOs, which is the subject of lively controversy around the world, should not be taken lightly.
“While we should advocate local agriculture and food, we are sloping into jovialism by promoting GMOs. Labeling is intended for organic foods, but not for GMOs. It makes no sense, ”said André Simard.
He also recalls that in 2004, a parliamentary committee specifically studied the question of the labeling of GMOs and made recommendations. “Sadly, true to themselves, the Liberals are letting dust accumulate on this report. We in the Parti Québécois believe that just like the method of slaughtering animals, consumers have the right to know what they are eating, ”concluded the member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata, André Simard.
