Québec, October 31, 2016 - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for justice, Véronique Hivon, as well as her colleagues Martine Ouellet, spokesperson for culture and communications, and Stéphane Bergeron, spokesperson for public security, are seriously concerned about the many cases in which the confidentiality of journalistic sources has been compromised. They demand a law on the protection of journalistic sources.
The story repeats itself. While we learned a few weeks ago that journalist Michaël Nguyen&#39;s computer had been searched, La Presse revealed this morning that Patrick Lagacé&#39;s phone was under surveillance by the SPVM.
“It is worrying that journalistic sources are not better protected. It is the work of journalists that is undermined and, consequently, the citizens&#39; right to information. It is high time to adopt a law aimed at clearly reaffirming the principle of the protection of journalistic sources and to provide for the criteria that must be met to override, in a very exceptional way, this principle ”, affirmed Véronique Hivon.
For her part, Martine Ouellet insisted on the importance of journalistic independence in the exercise of a healthy democracy. “Journalists have the right to do their job. This is not, here, an attack against a journalist, but a situation where investigative journalism is endangered, since sources will now hesitate to transmit information, ”she said. indicated.
“The Minister of Public Security, Martin Coiteux, must quickly make sure to get to the bottom of things in this affair. Such abusive practices are intolerable. We understand that we must protect the capacity, for this other pillar of our democracy that is our justice system, to fight effectively against crime, which undermines our institutions, but this must never be done to the detriment of individual freedoms and at the cost of an attack on the freedom and independence of the press, ”declared Stéphane Bergeron.
