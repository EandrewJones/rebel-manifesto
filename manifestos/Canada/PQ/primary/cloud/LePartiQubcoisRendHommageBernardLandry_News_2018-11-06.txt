The parliamentary leader of the Parti Québécois, Pascal Bérubé, as well as the president of the party, Gabrielle Lemieux, reacted to the sad announcement of the death of Mr. Bernard Landry, the Prime Minister, the statesman and the great patriot. On behalf of the Parti Québécois, they offer their sincere condolences to his wife, his children and grandchildren, his relatives, as well as to all the separatists.
“We have lost one of our greatest patriots, a man who made the independence of Quebec the cause of his life. On behalf of all the members of the Parti Québécois, I would like to express our deep sympathy to her loved ones and her family, ”Gabrielle Lemieux said straight away.
“As an independentist and patriot, Bernard Landry has dedicated his life to giving Quebeckers the means to achieve their ambitions. He saw, in the political situation of our nation, an aberration to be corrected ”, added Pascal Bérubé.
“If the Quebec economy is what it is today, it is thanks to people who, like Bernard Landry, had the audacity to make their vision a reality. Mr. Landry was one of the main players in Quebec&#39;s economic success, its openness to the new digital economy and major reforms that will have left a deep mark on our society. These actions, these reforms and this commitment are the result of one thing: his love for Quebec, ”continued the President.
Besides for his immense credibility in matters of economy and finance, we will remember Bernard Landry as being the one who allowed, among other things, the signing of the Paix des Braves, in 2001. “In short, all the reforms that he carried out, all the projects he undertook had only one big objective: to ensure that Quebecers unite and that they have enough confidence to say yes, once and for all. We will regret it. In his memory, we will try to live up to this great man and continue our journey along the path he has mapped out, until we reach our full freedom, ”concluded Pascal Bérubé.
