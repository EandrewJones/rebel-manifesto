Quebec - Learning with regret of the death of the former Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN), Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, and the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in International Affairs, Carole Poirier, made the following statement:
“On behalf of the Parti Québécois, we offer our sincere condolences to the family and loved ones of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. The commitment of this brilliant intellectual, Francophone and Francophile, as Secretary General of the United Nations, from 1992 to 1996, marked international diplomacy.
Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali was also the first secretary general of the International Organization of La Francophonie, from 1997 to 2002. Let us recall that he then ardently defended the place of the Francophonie on the international scene and that it is in this capacity, moreover, that he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Quebec in 2007. &quot;
