Quebec - The leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, and the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Parti Québécois spokesperson on the status of women, Carole Poirier, wish to pay tribute to Claire Kirkland-Casgrain, former judge and the first woman in Quebec to have served as Member of Parliament and Minister. The Parti Québécois proposes to the government that a national funeral be organized in his honor, if the family agrees.
“On behalf of the Parti Québécois, I offer my sincere condolences to the family and loved ones of Claire Kirkland-Casgrain. A pioneer in the emancipation of women in Quebec, she was elected Member of Parliament for Jacques-Cartier in 1961 and appointed Minister by Prime Minister Jean Lesage. Ms. Kirkland-Casgrain left a mark on Quebec, in particular through the many struggles she led to defend women&#39;s rights. For twelve years, Ms. Kirkland-Casgrain was the only woman to sit in the National Assembly. All Quebeckers owe him a lot. Today we pay tribute to her action and to the causes she defended, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“Claire Kirkland-Casgrain paved the way, embodying, in a way, the entry of Quebec into modernity. A source of inspiration, she opened the door of Parliament to the women of Quebec. She was, among other things, at the origin of the law putting an end to the legal incapacity of married women, and it was she who also presented the bill creating the Council for the Status of Women. This lawyer by training also served as a judge at the Provincial Court, where she was appointed in 1973. Her whole life has been marked by progress and firsts. She has worked a lot for the cause of women, but all of Quebec has evolved thanks to the advances she was at the origin. Thank you, Mrs. Kirkland-Casgrain, ”added Carole Poirier.
