Quebec - The member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, wishes to pay tribute to the independence activist Gilles Rhéaume, who died today.
“A great activist for the independence of Quebec, Gilles Rhéaume worked for some 50 years in several organizations, including the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Montréal, which he chaired. Passionate about Quebec, our language and our national history, he has always vigorously defended his convictions in all forums. On behalf of the entire Parti Québécois team, I extend my sincere condolences to the loved ones and the family of Gilles Rhéaume, ”declared Stéphane Bédard.
“Few people can claim to have half a century of commitment to a cause. To do this, you need to be endowed with tremendous determination and deep convictions, which he had, without a shadow of a doubt. The name of Gilles Rhéaume is forever associated with our common quest, among other things because he had faith in the ability of Quebecers to take their destiny in hand, ”added the leader of the official opposition.
