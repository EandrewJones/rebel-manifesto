Quebec, November 8, 2016 - Died Sunday at the age of 84, professor, sociologist and theologian Jacques Grand&#39;Maison leaves behind a considerable legacy. The leader of the official opposition, Jean? François Lisée, paid tribute to him.
“Jacques Grand&#39;Maison leaves in Quebec an admired intellectual heritage, after having published some fifty books during his successful career. In the Quebec of the sixties, he campaigned for the Church to come closer to the laity. He hoped that the transformations engendered by Vatican Council II would lead to a deeper and more authentic spiritual commitment. Subsequently, he launched, in collaboration with Solange Lefebvre, a major survey on generations. Defender of greater social solidarity and better transmission of knowledge between generations, he spared no efforts. In recent years, Jacques Grand&#39;Maison has published several essays on the blockages in Quebec society and the drifts of the modern world, ”said Jean-François Lisée straight away.
“Throughout his life, he has shown remarkable lucidity. It allowed us to better understand the transformations that Quebec was going through, when new values were needed. His striking findings did not go unnoticed. For your in-depth and inspiring research, for your many punchy essays, for all these stimulating and ambitious interventions for Quebec, thank you, Mr. Grand&#39;Maison, ”continued the leader of the official opposition.
&quot;I send, in my name and on behalf of the members of the Parti Québécois, my most sincere condolences to the relatives of Mr. Grand&#39;Maison&quot;, added Mr. Lisée.
Over the course of his prolific career, Jacques Grand&#39;Maison has received numerous distinctions. Among other things, the Université de Sherbrooke awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1987, and he was elevated to the rank of officer of the National Order of Quebec in 1996.
