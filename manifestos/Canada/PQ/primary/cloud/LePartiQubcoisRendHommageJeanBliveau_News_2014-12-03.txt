Quebec - The member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, wishes to pay tribute to Mr. Jean Béliveau, who died on December 2.
“On behalf of my fellow members of the Parti Québécois, I offer my sincere condolences to the family and loved ones of Jean Béliveau. I also send them to the great family of the Montreal Canadiens, an organization in which the famous number 4 worked for more than 60 years. He was a gentleman, a man of high class, and he contributed immensely to the advancement of our national sport and our society. A true hero for generations of fans, he embodied a model of respect, elegance and leadership, on and off the ice. Quebec is losing today not only the greatest captain in Canadian history, but also a man who inspired all those who knew and admired him. He will forever be one of the greats, ”said Stéphane Bédard.
