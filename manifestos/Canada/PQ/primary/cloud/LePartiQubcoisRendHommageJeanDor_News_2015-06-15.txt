Quebec - The member for Saint-Jérôme and leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, paid tribute to Mr. Jean Doré, former mayor of Montreal.
“It is with sadness that I learn of the death of this great Montrealer. On behalf of my fellow members of the Parti Québécois, I would like to express my sincere condolences to his family and loved ones as well as to the people who worked with him during his long and brilliant career. Jean Doré had immense love and ambition for his city. Always, he placed the citizens at the center of his political engagement. He left his mark on the metropolis with his clear vision of citizen participation, the environment, the preservation of heritage and town planning, among others. I want to salute his dedication to the people of Montreal and Quebec, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
The Leader of the Official Opposition also wished to underline the important accomplishments that Mr. Doré bequeathed to Montreal. “He is not only at the origin of a greater democratization of the municipal administration, but also of the first urban plan in the history of Montreal. We also owe him the redevelopment of several sectors of the city, including downtown, Old Montreal, the Lachine Canal, among others. Among its great legacies, we cannot overlook the Pointe-à-Callière Archeology and History Museum, the Biodôme, and the landscaping of the town hall garden. Jean Doré made a huge leap forward in Montreal, ”he added.
Pierre Karl Péladeau also praised Jean Doré&#39;s deep commitment to several social causes, in particular that of the Auberges du Cœur. “He served as president and spokesperson for Auberges du Cœur for over 10 years. He dedicated these years to young people in difficulty and homeless. As he said, Quebec must bet on its youth, on all its young people, because they constitute its capital of hope, ”he concluded.
