Quebec - The leader of the official opposition, responsible for the Capitale-Nationale region, Pierre Karl Péladeau, and the Member of Parliament for Taschereau, Agnès Maltais, paid tribute to Jean-Paul L&#39;Allier, who died last night.
“Jean-Paul L&#39;Allier has contributed to the advancement of Quebec and our national capital. As Minister of the Bourassa government, he was a defender of culture, having notably changed our cultural policy. I also remember the role he played in 1995, among others during the referendum campaign and as chairman of the Capital Commission on the future of Quebec. Today we are losing a great mayor, a man who loved his city and his fellow citizens. We will remember a committed mayor and a man of conviction. On behalf of the entire Parti Québécois team, I extend my sincere condolences to the family and loved ones of Mr. L&#39;Allier, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“As mayor, he brought a modern vision to the Quebec capital, by highlighting the concept of economics of beauty. He was able, thus, to rally the living forces of our city by reconciling urban planning, culture, tourism and democracy, in concert with international relations. It is also he who allowed the regrouping of the great city of Quebec. With regard to the development and beautification of the city, its great achievements remain unquestionably the revitalization of the Saint-Charles River and the Saint-Roch district. A great humanist, he is committed to numerous causes and within several organizations, in particular thanks to the very popular Brunch of the mayor of Quebec. Thank you, Mr. L&#39;Allier, ”added Agnès Maltais.
