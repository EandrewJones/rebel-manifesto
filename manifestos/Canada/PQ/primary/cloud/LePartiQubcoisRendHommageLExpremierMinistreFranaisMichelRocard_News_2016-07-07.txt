“Quebec and Quebecers have lost a great friend and a great defender, since Michel Rocard was a key player in relations between Quebec and France. Throughout his career, he has helped deepen the essential relationship between our two governments. It has also been an important international support for the independence of Quebec, since the very beginnings of the Parti Québécois. For all this we owe him a great deal. On behalf of the Parti Québécois, I offer my condolences to those close to them, to the French and to the Socialist Party, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
“The deep friendship that linked Michel Rocard and Quebec dates back to the 1970s. This link has grown deeply over the years. He has developed a sincere relationship with several premiers of Quebec, including René Lévesque. The relationship between Quebec and France is very important, and Michel Rocard has greatly contributed to it. It is for this reason, among other things, that Prime Minister Bernard Landry received him as an officer of the National Order of Quebec, on behalf of all citizens, in order to thank him for his attachment to our nation ”, added Carole Poirier.
“It is an honor for me to represent my political formation during the last tribute paid today by the French people to Michel Rocard. This once again demonstrates the strength of relations between Quebec and France, and between our two political parties, ”concluded Mathieu Traversy.
