Quebec - It is with sadness that the members of the Parti Québécois learned today of the death of one of Quebec&#39;s most illustrious playwrights, Mr. Marcel Dubé. On their behalf, the leader of the official opposition and the Parti Québécois spokesperson for culture and communications, Pierre Karl Péladeau and Véronique Hivon, expressed their deep sympathy to those he leaves behind in the mourning.
“I extend my deepest condolences to the family and many friends of Mr. Marcel Dubé. Although his absence creates a great void, the work he leaves us as a legacy is immensely rich. Without any doubt, it will survive him and will continue to amaze future generations, ”declared the Leader of the Official Opposition.
Véronique Hivon, for her part, insisted on the fact that Marcel Dubé&#39;s career was particularly flourishing, as much on stage as on television or on the radio, and that his work bears witness to the reality of Quebec. “Marcel Dubé made the best of each medium that could disseminate his ideas. From Zone play to Marcel Dubé&#39;s Le Monde series, including Le Temps des lilas and Un simple soldier, he has also been able to describe with acuity the internal conflicts that all human beings experience, without any form of complacency. . Furthermore, Marcel Dubé has always maintained a parallel between his writings and the evolution of the Quebec nation, which makes his work an eloquent and relevant historical reference. Quebec students will study it for a long time to come, as I have done myself, ”she said.
“Marcel Dubé was a pillar of our culture, one of the most talented and prolific writers of his generation. We are very grateful to him for his generosity towards us, ”concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
