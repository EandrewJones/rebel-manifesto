Quebec - The leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, and the member for Richelieu, Sylvain Rochon, paid tribute to the former member for Richelieu Maurice Martel, who died on December 1st.
He was Member of Parliament for the Richelieu constituency from 1966 to 1970, under the banner of the Union Nationale, then from 1976 to 1985, under that of the Parti Québécois. He was also Minister of Revenue in the offices of Prime Ministers René Lévesque and Pierre Marc Johnson.
“On behalf of the entire Parti Québécois team, I send my most sincere condolences to the family and loved ones of Maurice Martel. The Sorel-Tracy region loses an important builder, a man committed to his community, during and after his political life. As the first PQ member for the riding of Richelieu, he served his fellow citizens with class throughout his career, as a member of Parliament and as a pharmacist, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“For a good hour and a half, during my election campaign, I had the pleasure of discussing with him the issues of the riding, the future of Quebec, the role and life of an MP. He was generous to me with his long experience and his advice. Today, a whole region is in mourning. In mourning for a sincere politician, a convinced and convincing sovereignist, an excellent pharmacist and a particularly endearing gentleman, ”added Sylvain Rochon.
