Quebec - The member for Joliette and official opposition critic for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, wishes to pay tribute to the great actor and director Paul Buissonneau, who died last night.
“Quebec is losing a colorful character, a man larger than life. Director, theater director and actor, he left his mark on the world of Quebec culture. For more than 60 years, the Théâtre La Roulotte has entertained children; it has, in addition, allowed several actors to take their first steps. Let us also mention his character of Picolo, from the program La Boîte à surprise, which will be forever engraved in our memories. A man of rants and thunderous laughter, Paul Buissonneau was above all a man of heart, attached to Quebec. Its contribution to the culture of here is immense. On behalf of the parliamentary wing of the Parti Québécois, I offer my sincere condolences to her family and loved ones, ”said Véronique Hivon.
