Quebec - The member for Saint-Jérôme and leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, paid tribute to the former member for Deux-Montagnes, Pierre de Bellefeuille, who died yesterday.
“On behalf of the entire Parti Québécois family, I offer my most sincere condolences to Mrs. Thérèse Romer, Mr. de Bellefeuille&#39;s spouse, to her family and loved ones. Pierre de Bellefeuille was a member of Parliament committed to his community and to the independence of Quebec. A man of conviction, he has always ardently defended the French language and our culture, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
After a career in journalism, during which he was editor-in-chief of Maclean&#39;s Magazine, from 1960 to 1964, then host of the program La part du lion, on Radio-Canada, Pierre de Bellefeuille was the first member of the Parti Québécois in the riding of Deux-Montagnes, from 1976 to 1984. He was first parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Cultural Affairs, then held the same position with the Ministers of Intergovernmental Affairs and International Relations. He left the Parti Québécois caucus in November 1984 and sat as an independent member until the 1985 elections. In 1997, he founded, with Jean-François Nadeau, the satirical newspaper Le Couac.
“M. de Bellefeuille also co-wrote the book As long as independence is not achieved, it remains to be done in 1998; this title, very evocative, illustrates well the determination of the man. I salute the audacity he had to assert his opinion on the constitutional status of Quebec with so much aplomb, ”concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
