Quebec - The member for Verchères and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of work, Stéphane Bergeron, wishes to offer his most sincere condolences to the family and loved ones of the former trade unionist and MP Yvon Charbonneau.
“On behalf of the Parti Québécois, I offer my sincere condolences to the family and loved ones of Mr. Charbonneau, whom I had the pleasure and honor to meet while we both sat in the House of Commons of Canada. He has defended throughout his career as a union activist and president of the Central Education of Quebec the right to education, equity and social justice. Alongside union presidents Louis Laberge and Marcel Pépin, he was one of the leading figures of the first Common Front during the major demonstrations and protests surrounding public sector negotiations in 1972, a period during which they were, moreover, imprisoned. Subsequently, as deputy and ambassador to UNESCO, he continued to defend with conviction his vision of school and society. Finally, I extend my condolences to the Central Education Union team, as well as to the entire education community, which he has loved all his life, ”said Stéphane Bergeron.
