Quebec, September 8, 2016 - In light of the revelations concerning the conflict of interest involving the company of Yvon Nadeau, a close friend of Minister Lessard, the Member of Parliament for Taschereau and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of ethics, Agnès Maltais, asks for two inquiries: one from the Ethics Commissioner and one from the Lobbyists Commissioner.
“Yvon Nadeau was still political advisor to Minister Lessard&#39;s constituency office when the grant for his company, Pyrobiom Énergies inc., Was requested. The $ 3 million finally granted represents 40% of the implementation costs of the project to transform forest residues into biofuels by the company headed by Mr. Nadeau. This financial assistance represents, curiously, the maximum amount allowed by the Technoclimat program, where the money comes from. It&#39;s a funny coincidence; we have serious questions about this subsidy, ”said the spokesperson.
“What is even more worrying is the nature of the project, namely the transformation of forest residues; Laurent Lessard was at the same time Minister of Forests! Mr. Nadeau and Minister Lessard themselves admit having discussed it, although the former is not registered in the Lobbyists Registry. How could the Prime Minister appoint someone with such poor judgment to the MTQ, Quebec&#39;s largest contract giver? How can we think that there is no link between the position held by Mr. Nadeau and the obtaining of the $ 3 million? », Continued Agnès Maltais.
“Today, the Parti Québécois is making two requests, one to the Ethics and Professional Conduct Commissioner and one to the Lobbyists Commissioner, to investigate the process that led to the grant being awarded. Favoritism should never have a place in government; however, a few months after their return to power, the Liberals had already put their hands in the dish of candy, ”concluded the member for Taschereau.
