Québec, September 24, 2015 - Diane Lamarre, the member for Taillon and Parti Québécois spokesperson for health and access to care, strongly denounces the intention of the Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette, to legalize the Imposition of surcharges on patients, through a simple amendment to Bill 20. It demands an end to all ancillary costs.
“The Minister must ensure free and universality of health care by definitively eliminating all ancillary costs. Quebeckers do not have to pay a second time for services covered by the Health Insurance Act, ”said Diane Lamarre.
“Doctors have been entitled to huge increases in their compensation from the Liberals, from $ 2.9 billion to $ 6.8 billion between 2003 and 2015. Incidental fees, often unexpected, should not be paid by patients; they should be fully covered by the envelopes allocated to physicians which, let us remember, total nearly $ 7 billion. Only 1% of physician compensation is needed to cover all of what is currently overcharged to patients. We have a universal public health system. This means that when a patient goes to see a doctor, he uses his health insurance card, not his credit card, ”said Diane Lamarre. &quot;Gaétan Barrette the Minister protects what Gaétan Barrette the negotiator negotiated when he was at the helm of the FMSQ&quot;, she added.
The minister is trying to resolve the matter quickly with an amendment to Bill 20. “He&#39;s acting underhanded. None of the 46 groups that came to consult on Bill 20 last March was able to comment on this way of charging patients for incidental costs, since the bill made no mention of it. The minister is rather in the process of legalizing the illegal, ”concluded the deputy.
