Montreal– The Parti Québécois candidate in Vachon and Minister of Natural Resources, Martine Ouellet, the candidate in Rosemont and Minister of International Relations, La Francophonie and Foreign Trade and Minister responsible for the Montreal region, Jean-François Lisée, the candidate in Sainte-Marie-Saint-Jacques, Daniel Breton, and candidate in Saint-Henri-Sainte-Anne, Véronique Fournier, undertake to take the necessary steps so that the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) has access to the Hydro-Québec rate L. This commitment is part of the Parti Québécois government&#39;s transportation electrification strategy.
Martine Ouellet has already taken steps with Hydro-Québec to have it recognized that the STM is carrying out an industrial activity, which would make the latter eligible for Rate L.
&quot;We will continue the work: a Parti Québécois government will continue its efforts with Hydro-Québec so that the Société de transport de Montréal has access to rate L. This measure would represent for the STM an annual saving of approximately $ 400,000 per person. compared to the LG tariff, ”said Martine Ouellet.
The STM&#39;s total electricity bill in 2013 was approximately $ 25 million.
It should be remembered that in 2010, the Liberal government divided tariff L into tariffs L and LG. Rate L applies to industrial customers of 5 MW and more and rate LG to other customers of 5 MW and more.
“It is a measure that is close to our hearts since the STM provides an essential service to the citizens of Montreal. In addition, this is part of the continuity of our commitments for the electrification of transport, ”concluded Jean-François Lisée.
We have a plan and the team to be successful. Today, it is time to give ourselves the means to go even further.
