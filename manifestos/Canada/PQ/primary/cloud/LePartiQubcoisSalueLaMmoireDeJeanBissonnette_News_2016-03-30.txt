“Quebec is losing a patriarch of its cultural scene, a monument of entertainment. On behalf of the elected officials and activists of the Parti Québécois, I would like to express my deepest sympathy as well as my condolences to the family, friends and all those close to Jean Bissonnette. Respected by all, passionate about his profession, he was a great source of inspiration for those who surrounded him or followed him, ”declared the leader of the official opposition.
“We owe to Jean Bissonnette some of the most significant shows in the history of the small screen in Quebec: Moi et autre, Appelez-moi Lise, Les Lundis des Ha! Ha !, A guy, a girl, as well as several Bye Bye, to name a few. He left a considerable legacy, notably at Radio-Canada, where he worked for many years. We are very grateful to him for his contribution to our cultural life; he has accompanied Quebec for decades, and in its emancipation. Television and its artisans owe him a great deal, ”added Véronique Hivon.
