Quebec - It is with sadness that the member for Saint-Jérôme and leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, and the member for Verchères and spokesperson for the Outaouais region, Stéphane Bergeron, learned of the death by Ms. Jocelyne Ouellette, former member of the Parti Québécois in the riding of Hull and minister in René Lévesque&#39;s first cabinet.
“I extend my sincere condolences to Ms. Ouellette&#39;s family and loved ones, on behalf of myself and my fellow members of the Parti Québécois. His role within our great party was decisive; in addition to participating in its foundation, she worked very hard to make the program known to women and men in the Outaouais region. Having won the hearts of the citizens of Hull, she will have represented them with dignity in the National Assembly from 1976 to 1981. She will be remembered as a committed and determined woman, an activist above all, ”declared Pierre Karl Péladeau. .
Stéphane Bergeron, meanwhile, recalled that Jocelyne Ouellette was one of the first four women to be elected under the banner of the Parti Québécois. “She was a pioneer, not only for our project to make Quebec a country, but also in terms of ethics and integrity; in 1978, it was she who, as Minister of Public Works and Supply, established a system for awarding government contracts based on fairness and transparency, called &quot;Rosalie&quot;. It took courage and determination, but Ms. Ouellette was not the type to give up without a fight, or to pass the job on to someone else. Quebeckers, particularly those from the Outaouais, can count themselves lucky to have had it to look after their interests, ”he added.
