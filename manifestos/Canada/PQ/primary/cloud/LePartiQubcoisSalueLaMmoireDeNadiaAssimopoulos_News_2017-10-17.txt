The leader and president of the Parti Québécois, Jean-François Lisée and Gabrielle Lemieux, offered their condolences to the family and loved ones of Ms. Nadia Assimopoulos, an exceptional Quebecer and proud independence activist, who died on October 11.
“Curious and passionate, Ms. Assimopoulos offered the best of herself to Quebec, her adopted country, the one she had chosen. Our party, like several other organizations, including the University of Montreal, Polytechnique Montreal and the Superior Council of the French Language, were able to benefit from his generosity, his tact, his knowledge and his skills. On behalf of the Parti Québécois, members of Parliament and activists, I express my sincere sympathy to the members of his family as well as to his many friends, ”declared the leader of the Parti Québécois.
“A great lady has left us. Even without having known her, I can say that her influence remains within our movement. I am proud to succeed her as president, and I will do my best to live up to the rich heritage she has bequeathed to us, especially as a woman of diversity, whose passage has been marked by respect, rigor and balance in all things, ”for her part assured Gabrielle Lemieux.
In addition to a doctorate in sociology, Ms. Assimopoulos has taken an interest in social psychology, history, and political economy, among others. The French Republic named her a Knight of the Order of Academic Palms and a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters.
