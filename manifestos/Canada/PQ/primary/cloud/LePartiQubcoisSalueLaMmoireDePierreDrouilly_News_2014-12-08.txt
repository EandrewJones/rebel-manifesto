Montreal - It is with great sadness that the Parti Québécois and the members of its parliamentary wing have learned of the death of Pierre Drouilly, sociologist, seasoned political analyst and longtime independence activist. Aged 68, he passed away on Saturday morning in Longueuil, leaving to mourn his wife, Mrs. Francine Bombardier, his children, Laurence and Pascal, and his grandchildren.
“Upon his arrival in Quebec, Mr. Drouilly was passionate about the major debates of his host society. Over the years, he has notably established himself as an indisputable expert in Quebec electoral sociology. Each version of his Atlas contains invaluable secrets for those interested in the democratic life of a people. His legacy is colossal. We must underline this desire to name, understand, analyze and analyze the moods and habits of its fellow citizens, ”said Raymond Archambault, President of the Parti Québécois.
“Added to this dimension is the desire he had to change things over the long term. To do this, he invested himself at length within our bodies and the independence movement. I therefore salute the memory of a man who combined action with words, and a long-time collaborator of the Parti Québécois. My thoughts are with the family, friends and loved ones of this great activist, ”concluded Mr. Archambault.
