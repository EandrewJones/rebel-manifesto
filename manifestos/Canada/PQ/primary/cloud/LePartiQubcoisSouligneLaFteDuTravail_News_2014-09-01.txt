Quebec - The member for Sanguinet and official opposition critic for work and pensions, Alain Therrien, marks Labor Day.
“Today, I add my voice to workers across Quebec to emphasize the importance of providing good working conditions and a safe environment for all. Workers participate in greater prosperity for all of society. On this Labor Day, let&#39;s also have a thought for retirees; let&#39;s make sure we offer them the best possible living conditions after their career.
To achieve a more prosperous society, the Liberal government must quickly present a plan and a vision to support job creation and economic development. And it is certainly not by locking itself into a logic of austerity that it will promote job creation in the cities and regions of Quebec, ”declared Alain Therrien.
