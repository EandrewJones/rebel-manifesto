Quebec - The member for Jonquière and leader of the official opposition, Sylvain Gaudreault, wished to highlight the National Patriots&#39; Day as well as their struggle for the recognition of their nation, for its political freedom and for the establishment of a government democratic.
“Faced with the overwhelming law of the strongest and the weight of an apparent fatality, the patriots had only their bravery, their resilience, their love of freedom and their faith in a better future. They are true heroes, and we owe it to them to perpetuate the values for which they fought. Patriotic men and women, 180 years ago, stood up to defend the principles of equality, justice and democracy, ”declared the leader of the official opposition.
“The actions of the patriots must remain in our collective memory, since the values they courageously defended are more alive and more relevant than ever. Currently, the Liberal government is postponing the application of the history program to high school; we will continue to express our disagreement to him, ”he added.
“History inspires us, teaches us to make choices and it helps to develop enlightened citizens. She reminds us that a nation is being built day after day, through the choices it makes, the decisions it takes, the causes it defends. The Patriots of 1837-1838, among others, illustrate this reality well; their memory, like that of other characters who have marked our history, must absolutely be cultivated so that the people of Quebec continue to progress, with pride, determination and daring, ”concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
