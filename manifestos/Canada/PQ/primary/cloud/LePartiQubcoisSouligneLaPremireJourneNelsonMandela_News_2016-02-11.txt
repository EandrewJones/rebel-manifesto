Quebec - Parliamentarians from all political parties represented in the National Assembly today underlined the first Nelson Mandela Day in the House, designated as such following the unanimous adoption, on June 12, 2015, of a law sponsored by the member for Bourget and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on immigration and cultural communities, Maka Kotto.
“The fight led by the one who was the president of South Africa from 1994 to 1998, but above all the father of a multiethnic and democratic South Africa, is a model for those who understand that freedom, justice , human rights, fraternity and equality between peoples are universal values. Dedicating this day of February 11 to him is to recognize his exceptional contribution to the defense and promotion of these values which are also dear to the people of Quebec, ”said Maka Kotto.
The member for Bourget also recalled that at the time, Quebec had endorsed Mr. Mandela&#39;s cause. “Several Quebec politicians have acted in support of Nelson Mandela, including René Lévesque, Robert Bourassa, Jean Doré and Brian Mulroney. Their concrete actions, like others around the world, were significant and allowed, on February 11, 1990, the release of Mr. Mandela after long years of imprisonment, after years spent dismantling the institutional political system of the racial segregation that apartheid was, ”he continued.
“Nelson Mandela&#39;s struggle remains a source of inspiration. It teaches us that whatever obstacles we encounter, we must always aspire to more freedom, democracy, equality. In this area, I believe that Quebec is a good example for the world, ”concluded Maka Kotto.
