Québec, November 18, 2014 - As part of the 27th Drug Addiction Prevention Week, the member for Rosemont and official opposition critic for social services, youth protection, home care and prevention, Jean-François Lisée, would like to thank all those involved who work every day with heart and dedication to meet the needs of people living with addiction, and to salute the courage of all those who engage in a rehabilitation process.
“Admitting that you are struggling with an addiction is in itself an almost heroic act, and it is the first step towards recovery. However, we need support. Fortunately, the approximately 5% of the population that the consumption of alcohol or drugs, or even gambling or gambling makes vulnerable can count on the competent professionals of the many aid organizations. I am thinking, among others, of Portage, which, for more than 41 years, has been helping drug addicts overcome their addiction, ”said Jean-François Lisée.
In addition, the member takes the opportunity to highlight the launch, on November 17, of a portrait of our public rehabilitation network, produced by the Association of Quebec Dependency Rehabilitation Centers. &quot;We sincerely hope that reading this document will enable the Minister of Health and Social Services to understand the importance of the addiction control mission as well as that of&quot; know-how as precious as it is exceptional &quot;, to which refers to his colleague Minister Delegate in his preface, and that this network will be spared by its reform aimed at &quot;hospitalocentrist&quot;, &quot;continued the member for Rosemont.
“Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the importance that must be given to prevention. We are also still waiting for a national prevention policy, which would meet needs that are certainly much more concrete, glaring and fundamental than reform of the structures of the health network, ”concluded Jean-François Lisée.
