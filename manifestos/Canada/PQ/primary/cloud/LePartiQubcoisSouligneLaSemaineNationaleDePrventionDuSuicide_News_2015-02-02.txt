Quebec - Jean-François Lisée, the member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, youth protection, home care and prevention, marks the 25th National Suicide Prevention Week.
“In 2012, 1,102 people took their own lives in Quebec; that&#39;s 3 people a day, 3 people too many. Efforts to combat this sad and harmful phenomenon must be intensified and awareness-raising continued. Because despite the gains made in recent years in suicide prevention, constant vigilance remains necessary. All means must be put in place so that every Quebecer knows where to find help; no one should consider suicide as an option anymore, ”said Jean-François Lisée.
The MP stresses, however, that in this regard, the effects of liberal austerity are worrying. “Suicide prevention workers like us fear government cuts. Let us hope that the latter quickly unveils its suicide prevention policy; we are looking forward to it, ”he concluded.
Jean-François Lisée also insisted on the importance of seeking help; at any time, people with suicidal thoughts or a loved one in a state of distress can contact a specialist at 1 866 APPELLE (277-3553).
