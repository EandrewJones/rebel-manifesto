While studying and doing nothing but chasing their dream, 14 young women were cut down. Our hearts go out today to these women and their loved ones. The commemoration of this tragedy prompts us to reflect collectively on violence in our society, especially violence against women and girls. We must do everything, do everything, so that such a tragedy never happens again, ”said Stéphane Bédard.
“The Polytechnique event directly affected our identity and our values. Our company believes in equality. In this sense, combating all forms of violence is a collective duty as much as an individual responsibility. Occurring 25 years ago, this drama was the basis of a common awareness. Despite the great advances made by women in society and on the labor market, there is still a long way to go. The march for equality between women and men must continue, ”added Carole Poirier.
