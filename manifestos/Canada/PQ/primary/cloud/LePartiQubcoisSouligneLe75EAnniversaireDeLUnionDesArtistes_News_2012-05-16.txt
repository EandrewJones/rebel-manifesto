Quebec - The Parti Québécois today celebrated in the National Assembly the 75th anniversary of the Union des artistes (UDA).
“The Union des artistes plays a major role in the vitality of our culture in Quebec. For 75 years, thousands of artists and artisans have contributed to making Quebec culture the foundation of our identity and helped shape its meaning, ”declared the Leader of the Official Opposition and Member of Parliament for Charlevoix , Pauline Marois.
The deputy for Bourget and official opposition spokesperson for culture and communications, Maka Kotto, stressed the capital importance of the UDA in its constant actions for the defense and promotion of the arts and Quebec culture.
Representing more than 12,000 artists and craftsmen in all disciplines, the UDA notably played a decisive role in the establishment of the Coalition for Cultural Diversity which led, in 2007, to the adoption of the Convention on the Protection and the promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions. The UDA has also, over the years, supported artists in this speech that has shaped large areas of social and political evolution in Quebec.
“From the first president in 1937, René Bertrand to Raymond Legault, the current president of the UDA, via Jean Duceppe, Robert Rivard, Louise Deschâtelets, Serge Turgeon, Pierre Curzi and many others, Maka Kotto was keen to congratulate all the presidents who have enabled the advent of better working conditions and remuneration for Quebec artists and artisans, ”concluded Maka Kotto.
