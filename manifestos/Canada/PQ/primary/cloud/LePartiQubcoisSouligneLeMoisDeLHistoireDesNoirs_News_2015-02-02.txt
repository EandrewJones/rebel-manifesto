Quebec - The member for Bourget and official opposition critic for immigration, Maka Kotto, marks Black History Month.
&quot;On behalf of my fellow deputies, I invite the population to participate in large numbers in the activities that will take place during the month of February to recall the exceptional contribution of our black fellow citizens to the development and success of the Quebec nation. . For more than 300 years, they have enriched Quebec with their experiences, their knowledge and their cultures. They have greatly contributed to shaping Quebec society, a tolerant, open and creative society. Collectively, we owe them a lot, ”said Maka Kotto.
The MP also paid tribute to the courage shown by black people around the world throughout history. “Let&#39;s celebrate their journey, often marked by solidarity and determination. Many of their outstanding figures forever embody respect and dignity. In their honor, let us continue to ensure that in Quebec, each person, whatever their origins, can aspire to happiness and success, ”he added.
On November 23, 2006, the National Assembly adopted a bill to make February Black History Month, in order to underline their historic contribution to Quebec society. This law entered into force on February 1, 2007.
