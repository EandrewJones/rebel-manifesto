Quebec - The MNA for Saint-Jérôme and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, as well as the MNA for Rousseau and Finance and Revenue Critic, Nicolas Marceau, marked the 50th anniversary of the Caisse de Quebec deposit and placement.
“On July 15, 1965, the government of Jean Lesage adopted Bill 51 creating the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec. Supported by visionaries and builders, this institution has become a powerful tool for emancipation and economic development for Quebecers. This allowed us, at the time, to get out of the grip of the financial world of St-James Street. I cannot ignore the immense contribution of Prime Minister Jacques Parizeau in the creation of the Caisse de dépôt et placement. Then economic advisor to Prime Minister Jean Lesage, he helped set up an institution that did not exist anywhere else, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“The Quiet Revolution was a great period of social and economic liberation for Quebecers, and the Caisse was an essential instrument in doing so. The place it occupies is important for the development of our businesses and the fruitfulness of the citizens&#39; stockings. It has supported local businesses, which has enabled them to grow and, for some, to become the flagships of Quebec, ”added Nicolas Marceau.
