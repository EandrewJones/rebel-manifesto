Québec, November 11, 2014 - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, will table a motion in the National Assembly today inviting the members of the Committee on relations with citizens to decide on a mandate of initiative on sexual violence against women.
“Violence against women will never be acceptable; it is a very serious social problem that concerns us all. The recent wave of denunciations of sexual assault in the media and on social networks calls out to us. The Committee on Citizen Relations must look into this phenomenon, ”said Carole Poirier.
The motion reads as follows:
“That the National Assembly take note of the recent wave of denunciations of sexual assault in the Quebec media;
That it recognize that sexual violence against women is an extremely worrying societal problem which concerns us all without exception;
That it encourage victims to denounce all forms of assault and that it ask the government to strengthen the assistance services for victims currently available;
That it recall the motion voted unanimously on December 6, 2013 by the National Assembly asking the government to submit in 2014 its action plan on sexual exploitation;
Finally, that it invite the members of the Committee on Citizen Relations to rule on a mandate of initiative on this subject, taking the example of the Special Committee on the question of dying with dignity. &quot;
&quot;It is possible for parliamentarians, if they give the mandate to the Commission, to debate this issue in order to improve the lot of women victims of violence and to put in place means to prevent such acts&quot;, concluded Carole Poirier.
