Québec, October 17, 2014 - Harold LeBel, the member for Rimouski and official opposition spokesperson for the fight against poverty, solidarity and social economy, marks the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty . It invites the population and the government to reflect on the measures to be put in place to help the poor and vulnerable.
“The fight against poverty is a matter of social justice and solidarity that concerns the entire population. On the one hand, everyone is likely to find themselves, one day, in a situation of poverty. A health problem, age, isolation or marginalization can suddenly put us in a very difficult economic position. On the other hand, a healthy society is an inclusive and egalitarian society. We now know that there is a strong link between reducing poverty and reducing violence and health problems, ”said Harold LeBel.
The member also reiterated that the Liberal government must do everything in its power to support the most vulnerable in our society, in particular by stopping the cuts that directly affect them. “Liberal austerity hurts the most disadvantaged and the organizations that help them on a daily basis. The government must review the law to fight poverty and social exclusion. The results of the last 10 years must be taken, and new objectives must be defined, far from liberal austerity, ”he concluded.
Recall that the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty has been celebrated every year since 1993, when the General Assembly of the International Organization of the United Nations designated this day to promote awareness of the need to eradicate poverty. and poverty in all countries, one of the eight Millennium Development Goals.
