Quebec– The member for Sanguinet and official opposition critic for labor and pensions, Alain Therrien, joins his voice to that of all workers on May 1st.
“International Workers&#39; Day is an opportunity to recall the essential contribution of women and men to the advent of a more prosperous and just society. We must underline the collective need that we have to offer a safe environment for all and, above all, good working conditions. The government must take its rightful place to promote and guarantee the defense of workers&#39; rights. In particular, we call on Premier Couillard to continue implementing the Priorité emploi economic policy, which was particularly promising for the thousands of employees in Quebec&#39;s manufacturing sector, ”said Mr. Therrien.
