Quebec - The MNA for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, and the MNA for Sanguinet and Labor Critic, Alain Therrien, join their voices to that of all Quebecers to mark International Workers&#39; Day and workers, which will take place tomorrow, as well as their essential contribution to the development of Quebec society.
“Every year, May 1 is an opportunity to remind ourselves that the future of Quebec depends on increased support for workers, so that everyone can make their contribution to the economic, social and cultural development of Quebec. On this International Workers&#39; Day, we will also reiterate the need to provide good conditions and a safe working environment. Tomorrow, the Parti Québécois will be alongside citizens and workers to say it again to the government. We will also take the opportunity to reaffirm our clear opposition to liberal austerity, ”declared Stéphane Bédard.
Liberal austerity, a brake on Quebec&#39;s development
Alain Therrien mentions for his part that tomorrow, members of the Parti Québécois will participate in various civic demonstrations in several regions of Quebec. “Families, regions and workers are paying the price for the cuts imposed by the Liberal government. Our public health and education networks are hit hard, as are the services provided to the most vulnerable in our society. It is not by cutting everywhere that we will ensure the future of our nation, but by having a vigorous development policy on the economic and social levels, coupled with a long-term vision. The Liberal government must listen to all citizens who demonstrate, ”he concluded.
