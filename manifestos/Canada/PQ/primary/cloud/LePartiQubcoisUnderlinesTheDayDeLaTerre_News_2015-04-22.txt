Québec– The member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and the environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, invites Quebecers to mark Earth Day and to participate in the global movement of transition towards a more eco-friendly.
“Quebecers are increasingly mobilized to make Quebec a green society. They are interested in participating in the collective effort and moving towards a world that lives more in harmony with its environment, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
The choices made by Quebec society in terms of climate, energy, transport and land use planning will be decisive for the future viability of our planet. &quot;It is through enlightened decisions in these areas that we will ensure for the generations that will follow us a healthy environment in the long term,&quot; added the Member for Jonquière.
The Parti Québécois recalls that in order to fulfill its obligations in terms of environmental protection, Quebec has every interest in becoming a country; it will thus be able to vote all its laws and sign all of its treaties. “Canada is lagging behind other countries. It is as a sovereign state that Quebec will ensure the viability and future of its environment. In the meantime, the Parti Québécois tabled Bill 390, aimed at guaranteeing the primacy of Quebec&#39;s environmental jurisdiction. We are asking the Liberal government to call our bill, ”Sylvain Gaudreault concluded.
