Quebec - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on the status of women, Carole Poirier, this morning tabled in the House Bill 594, An Act to amend the Act respecting elections and referendums in municipalities, in order to allow any elected municipal official to be absent from council meetings for a maximum period of 18 consecutive weeks, if this absence is attributable to her pregnancy, the birth of her child or an adoption, without his term of office terminating.
The MP would like the support of the Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Lise Thériault, the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Martin Coiteux, as well as the opposition parties in order to pass this bill quickly. “Women are still too few in municipal politics. They are only 17% to occupy the seat of mayor and 32%, that of councilor. Improving work-family balance also means working to advance the place of women in politics, ”said Carole Poirier.
“Bill 594 aims to attract more women into politics. The next municipal election will take place in 2017. It is time to dust off the rules governing parental leave to promote the increased presence of women on municipal councils, ”added the MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
This legislative change proposed by the Parti Québécois is based on a broad consensus that has emerged from the municipal sector. It was recommended in particular by the working committee on work-family reconciliation measures at the City of Montreal in October 2015. “We must underline the determination of several elected municipal officials who fought to change mentalities,” Carole concluded.
