While in Rosemont, the leader of the Parti Québécois, Jean-François Lisée, announced that a Parti Québécois government would promote the installation of greenhouses on the roofs of buildings in urban areas, by giving property tax rebates for five years. to owners who install them.
IN SHORT
“There are thousands of empty roofs in Montreal and across Quebec. Often this space could produce fruits and vegetables. At the Parti Québécois, we want to create an &quot;urban agriculture&quot; reflex, especially for new constructions. We will encourage people to put greenhouses on the roofs of buildings. How? &#39;Or&#39; What? By giving homeowners who install a greenhouse a reduction in property taxes for five years, ”revealed Jean-François Lisée.
The initiative will have multiple benefits. “Encouraging urban agriculture is to encourage local purchasing, it is to fight against heat islands, it is to reduce GHGs. It means giving ourselves the means so that Quebecers have easy access to fresh food and local products, even in town! In addition, by combining this measure with that concerning school lunches, everyone will be a winner, ”continued Jean-François Lisée.
With this measure, the Parti Québécois particularly targets large commercial or industrial building projects, but does not exclude those in the residential sector. “What we are proposing to Quebecers is to set in motion a great movement in favor of urban agriculture. We will go gradually: first, we want the new buildings to include greenhouses, ”concluded the leader of the Parti Québécois.
