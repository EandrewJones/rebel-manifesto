Quebec - Following the unanimous adoption, on February 26, of a motion to make February 11 of each year a tribute to Nelson Mandela, the member for Bourget and official opposition critic for Immigration Officer Maka Kotto today tabled Bill 493, An Act to proclaim Nelson Mandela Day.
“Nelson Mandela is a model, a reference for those who understand that freedom, justice, human rights, equality and fraternity among peoples constitute fundamental universal values. To dedicate a day to him would be to recognize his exceptional contribution to the defense and the promotion of these, ”declared the deputy for Bourget.
Maka Kotto also recalled that at the time, Quebec, through its politicians, clearly supported Nelson Mandela in his quest for freedom and fairness. “René Lévesque banned the sale of South African wines to the SAQ. Brian Mulroney played a major role internationally in supporting the boycott of South Africa as long as apartheid continued. Jean Doré refused to award any contract to a company with interests in South Africa. Finally, Robert Bourassa amended the Cities and Towns Act to allow Jean Doré to act. Beyond partisan lines, our leaders concretely supported this great man that was Nelson Mandela. We therefore hope that our bill will be adopted quickly, in order to continue this noble tradition, ”he concluded.
