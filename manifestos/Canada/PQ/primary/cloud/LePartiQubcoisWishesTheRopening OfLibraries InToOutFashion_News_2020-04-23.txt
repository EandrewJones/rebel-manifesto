Québec, April 23, 2020 - In the wake of her request that Québec put forward a recovery and promotion plan for the cultural industry, the member for Gaspé and the Parti Québécois culture spokesperson, Méganne Perry Mélançon, there is a promising proposal: that bookstores can reopen by adopting a formula such as “take out” orders.
IN SHORT
“As all the signs indicate that reading will be a very popular activity this summer, it would be very fitting if bookstores could offer a take-out service, like restaurants or pharmacies do. The formula we offer has many advantages: not only will readers have direct access to the products they want, but booksellers will also benefit, in particular by avoiding delivery costs. For a small independent business, this can be a game-changer, ”said Méganne Perry Mélançon.
In his view, such a service does not represent an increased risk of contamination - neither for customers, nor for traders. “We have examples that come to us from Europe: in Berlin, during the confinement, the bookstores remained operational, because they were considered essential. In France, we are undertaking these days a partial reopening, using this formula &quot;to take away&quot;. If we ensure compliance with health and distancing rules, we do not have to fear the spread of the virus. Other businesses do; it&#39;s fast, it works well, and it can be deployed now, ”added the member for Gaspé.
“The arts and culture community needs a clear signal, and bookstores are an essential link in the chain. Giving them oxygen is to show the importance that authors and, more broadly, artists have in our life, ”concluded Méganne Perry Mélançon.
Quebec has some 200 licensed bookstores spread across the country. With the addition of 4000 to 5000 new titles per year, the industry has something to satisfy every Quebecer.
