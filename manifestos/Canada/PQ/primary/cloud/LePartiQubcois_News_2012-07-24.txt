Quebec - The Member of Parliament for Taschereau and official opposition spokesperson for the Capitale-Nationale, Agnès Maltais, strongly denounces the decision authorized by the Liberal government to grant a 42% salary increase to the lieutenant&#39;s assistant governor of Quebec.
“Through the journalist Mathieu Boivin at FM 93, it was with amazement that I learned this morning that the follies in the office of the lieutenant governor continue. Obtaining a 42% salary increase all at once by a decision of the Executive Council and the Treasury Board revolts any taxpayer, ”lambasted Agnès Maltais.
The member for Taschereau cannot believe that this decision, taken in 2009, was hidden by the government of the Liberal Party. “After the damning report of the Auditor General in 2007 for the scandal under the reign of Lise Thibault with unjustified expenses of $ 700,000, the Liberal members maintained that transparency would apply from now on. They still broke their word, ”she added, also recalling that the lieutenant-governor himself, Pierre Duchesne, promised, when he was sworn in in 2007,“ transparency ”and“ sobriety ”.
“At the time of Lise Thibault, these follies were done without the knowledge of everyone; this time, on the contrary, the Liberal government is complicit in it. It is shameful and appalling. I can&#39;t wait to hear the liberal justifications, ”said Agnès Maltais.
“The office of lieutenant governor is archaic, it is time to end it. The Parti Québécois calls on the Liberal Party of Quebec and asks it to put an end to these follies, ”concluded the Member for Taschereau.
