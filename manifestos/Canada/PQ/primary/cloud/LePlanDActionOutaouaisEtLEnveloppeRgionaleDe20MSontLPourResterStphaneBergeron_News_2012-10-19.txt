Quebec - It is in these terms that the Minister of Public Security and Minister responsible for the Outaouais region, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, reacted to the erroneous interpretations following the comments he made during his visit to the region on October 17th.
“Our government recognizes the uniqueness of the Outaouais, given its border location with Ontario. The Outaouais Action Plan contains structuring measures that are important for access to medical and hospital services, as well as for dealing with the shortage of human resources. My colleague, the Minister of Health and Social Services, Mr. Réjean Hébert, also confirmed the maintenance of this plan yesterday, after leaving the Council of Ministers, ”indicated Minister Bergeron.
