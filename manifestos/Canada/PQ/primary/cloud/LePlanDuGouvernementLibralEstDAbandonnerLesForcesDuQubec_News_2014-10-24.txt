Quebec, October 24, 2014 - The member for Sanguinet and official opposition spokesperson for the Treasury Board, Alain Therrien, this morning called on the Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, to question the National Assembly this morning. the Liberal government&#39;s vision for the economy, except for Quebec&#39;s basket of public services, which it wants to bring back to the level of the Canadian average.
“Yesterday, the National Bank lowered its forecast for Quebec GDP growth from 1.9% to 1.6%. Obviously, the government of Philippe Couillard has no economic policy and is unable to increase revenues. So, ideologically, he is taking advantage of the situation to do away with what sets us apart from Canada, while even staunch federalists like Robert Bourassa held to this particular identity. He wants, no more and no less, to put to the ground what makes the originality and the specificity of Quebec ”, declared Alain Therrien.
“The government was counting on the liberal effect for economic growth. In power for six months, he realizes that magical thinking does not work. In addition, under the mask of austerity, the government centralizes and reduces services, which hurts families, workers, regions and the most disadvantaged. What is more, the Permanent Curriculum Review Board is not even authorized to speak publicly. However, the government must absolutely answer for its cuts and its political choices, ”concluded the member for Sanguinet.
