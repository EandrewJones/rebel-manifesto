Quebec - The leader of the official opposition, member for Jonquière and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in the area of sustainable development, Sylvain Gaudreault, the member for Terrebonne and spokesperson in the environment and the fight against climate change, Mathieu Traversy, as well as the member for Sanguinet and spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, denounce the position of the federalist parties on the Energy East project.
&quot;By refusing to support a motion by the Parti Québécois demanding that the Government of Quebec take a stand against the Energy East project, the Liberal Party and the Coalition Avenir Québec are providing additional proof that their elected officials are not in tune with the population. that they represent. It is very clear: Quebeckers cannot count on the federalist parties to defend their interests, ”declared Sylvain Gaudreault.
“Unlike the elected members of the Liberal Party and the CAQ, the Parti Québécois continues to demand that the last word on the Energy East project rests with Quebeckers, and them alone. The citizens are asking for concrete solutions to successfully complete Quebec&#39;s energy transition. They want the electrification of transport, real advances in public transport and sustainable land use planning; not one more oil transport project in their backyard! », Added Mathieu Traversy.
“It is up to Quebeckers to decide whether the pipeline project will see the light of day or not. The government must put on its pants and listen to the people. And let us remember that the latter does not see sufficient economic benefits; the social acceptability of such a project is not there, ”concluded Alain Therrien.
