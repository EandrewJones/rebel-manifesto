Quebec - The official opposition spokesperson for social services and Member of Parliament for Rosemont, Jean-François Lisée, urges the Minister for Rehabilitation, Youth Protection and Public Health, Lucie Charlebois, and the Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, to respect the unanimous commitment of the National Assembly to increase the funding of community organizations working in health and social services.
&quot;The groups are worried, and we too, about the silence of the Liberals on this subject during the campaign, and that of the Couillard government since its election,&quot; said Jean-François Lisée. The 3,000 community health and social service organizations contribute to the quality of life of hundreds of thousands of Quebecers with, in particular, mental health, homelessness or addiction problems. The organizations also support young people in difficulty, people with disabilities and their families, seniors and people in need. &quot;
Noting that the structural underfunding of these groups threatened their ability to fulfill their mandate, the National Assembly unanimously adopted a motion calling for increased funding for independent community action organizations in health and social services.
In its action plan Solidarity: A Wealth for Quebec, the Parti Québécois government announced, in the fall of 2013, an annual reinvestment of $ 40 million, the first payment of which was to be made next September.
“It is now time for the Couillard government to confirm to the community that the money to support their overall mission will be included in the next budget. It is absolutely unacceptable for the most vulnerable Quebecers to pay for the austerity advocated by the Couillard government, ”concluded the member for Rosemont.
