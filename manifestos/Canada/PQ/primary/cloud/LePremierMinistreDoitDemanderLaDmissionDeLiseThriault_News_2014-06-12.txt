Quebec - In light of the information made public by the media, following the partial lifting of publication bans concerning the conditions of detention of the three accused escaped from the Quebec City Detention Center, the member for Matane? Matapédia and spokesperson of the official opposition in matters of public security, Pascal Bérubé, asked the Prime Minister to demand the resignation of the Minister of Public Security, Lise Thériault.
“There are several reasons for this request:
The inadequate reaction time of the minister, who first met the press 36 hours after the events;
The lightness with which she handled this important public safety issue;
The accusations made by the minister this morning, according to which her entourage would have lied to her in this matter, are very serious. They sow confusion in his ministry and discredit the police forces and the prison environment;
For all these reasons, the minister is no longer worthy to perform her duties. The Prime Minister must demand his resignation as Minister of Public Security, ”said Pascal Bérubé.
Watch the press conference.
