Quebec - On the eve of International Workers&#39; Day, while Prime Minister Philippe Couillard seems to be on the path to holding an economic summit to boost employment in Quebec, the head of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, who proposed this idea on May 18, 2015, is once again reaching out to the government.
“As soon as I arrived as leader of the Parti Québécois, noting the gloom and the absence of a credible and consensual plan in economic matters, I proposed to the Prime Minister that this summit be held. I then suggested that he invite the socio-economic players to an important meeting where we could all contribute to defining the means and priorities of a real sustainable growth plan. Several actors had supported the idea, however rejected out of hand by Philippe Couillard. Today, we are happy that he finally seems to consent, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
Since the Parti Québécois made this proposal for an economic summit to the Prime Minister, the situation has deteriorated further, making the holding of this meeting of socioeconomic actors more urgent than ever: growth limited to 1%, business investment to zero, no jobs created in the last 12 months.
Let us recall that the leader of the Parti Québécois, for his part, toured the major players in the economy and social economy in Quebec, in order to be able to present proposals to stimulate growth and ensure the prosperity of our regions. Some of them will be unveiled soon.
The Prime Minister must confirm it “We ask Philippe Couillard to quickly confirm the holding of this meeting and to indicate to us when it will take place. It must be done as quickly as possible. We offer, as we have done for a year, our collaboration. Liberal austerity has hurt economic development, even though there has been no job creation for a year. We must do better, ”concluded the leader of the Parti Québécois.
