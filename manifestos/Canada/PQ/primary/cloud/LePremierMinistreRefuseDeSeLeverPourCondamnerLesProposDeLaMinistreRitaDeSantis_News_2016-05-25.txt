Quebec - The MP for Marie-Victorin and House Leader of the Official Opposition, Bernard Drainville, deplores the fact that the Prime Minister refused to rise to answer questions concerning the unacceptable comments made by the Minister responsible for Access to Information and Reform of Democratic Institutions, Rita de Santis.
&quot;The Prime Minister, he who never ceases to wrap himself in morality, who never misses an opportunity to accuse the other parties of drifting or to accuse us of intolerance, does he consider the words of his minister? worthy of a minister of the government of Quebec? Imagine if these words had been spoken by a member of the Parti Québécois or even the CAQ; we would have had the right to a great outcry, to loud and loud cries, to requests for resignation. The Prime Minister would have been quick to talk about calls for violence and hate speech in all forums. What he was being asked to do today was to stand up and admit that his minister has gone too far. We wanted him to admit, at the very least, a little uneasiness. He didn&#39;t even do it, it&#39;s deplorable, ”said Bernard Drainville.
“Each week brings its share of controversial comments from Minister de Santis. After calling the fundraising goal of $ 150,000 imposed on Liberal ministers as peanuts, after having endorsed the idea of Liberal activists to uncap donations to $ 100, she stumbled again, during a public event, in the presence of the mayor of Montreal. I quote her, speaking of her teacher: &quot;Anyone who talks to a child like she spoke to me should be killed, slaughtered, thrown away I don&#39;t know where.&quot; End of quote. The minister apologized, it was the only thing to do, but why did the Prime Minister not intervene today to admit that she had slipped? », Concluded the parliamentary leader of the official opposition.
