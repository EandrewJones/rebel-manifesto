Québec, September 7, 2016 - The member for Saint-Jean and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in the areas of employment, social solidarity, the fight against poverty and for youth, Dave Turcotte, deplores that the only time in several month when Prime Minister Philippe Couillard shows real firmness, it is to sanction young people receiving social assistance, by brandishing a thinly veiled threat of parliamentary gag order.
“We would have liked to see, on the part of the Prime Minister, the same determination and the same determination to oppose the sale of Rona, to clean up the MTQ and to limit the huge increases in doctors&#39; salaries. He could also have been uncompromising by refusing any cut affecting student services in our schools. No, the Prime Minister is determined only when it comes to sanctioning young people on welfare, ”said Dave Turcotte.
“The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, François Blais, remains unable to demonstrate how the application of sanctions against the most vulnerable in our society promotes their integration or reintegration into the labor market. I remind the minister that in parliamentary committee, we received several groups; none of them supported the sanctions provided for in Bill 70. Why? It&#39;s simple: in Quebec, we cannot live on only $ 400 a month, ”concluded the member for Saint-Jean.
