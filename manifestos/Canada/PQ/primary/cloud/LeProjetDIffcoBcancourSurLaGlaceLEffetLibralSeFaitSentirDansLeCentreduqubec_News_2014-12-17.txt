Québec, December 17, 2014 - Following the announcement of the putting on hold of the major nitrogen fertilizer production plant project of the IFFCO company in Bécancour, the member for Saint-Jérôme and spokesperson for the he official opposition in matters of the economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, calls on the Liberal government to come out of its torpor and act for employment in Quebec and Bécancour.
“The IFFCO project is awaited by the people of the region. It would create 1,500 jobs during its construction and 250 in the long term. The Minister of the Economy, Jacques Daoust, and the Minister for Regional Economic Development, Jean-Denis Girard, must immediately get to work with the company to make this project a reality. The region has already suffered enough from the liberal effect, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
No economic policy for employment
“We still have proof that the liberal effect does not work, that it is a figment of the imagination. Only Premier Couillard and his ministers continue to make it their economic policy. As Christmas approaches, it is time to give Quebeckers a concrete gift: promote job creation through a real economic policy, ”said the MP.
Since taking office, the Liberals have increased taxes, levies and tariffs by nearly $ 800 million, not to mention the increase in electricity rates, school taxes and municipal taxes. “The Liberal government has shamelessly and relentlessly drawn into the pockets of Quebecers since it came to power. Now is the time for him to work so hard to create jobs, ”concluded the member for Saint-Jérôme.
