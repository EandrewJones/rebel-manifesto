Quebec - The Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports, Ms. Marie Malavoy, is particularly pleased to announce that the bill on full-time kindergarten for 4-year-old children in underprivileged areas has finally passed the stage of the detailed study at the Committee on Culture and Education. &quot;This bill, if it passes the last stage, will make it possible to fight against dropping out of school and prevent the most risky situations for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds,&quot; said the Minister.
This measure is eagerly awaited by school boards, teachers and parents, who are very keen on it. “It is thanks to the invaluable support of partners in the education community that the bill was able to reach this stage in parliamentary committee. They intervened publicly and even showed up in large numbers last Tuesday to ensure that the debates would run smoothly. Without them, we would not be able to pass this law before the end of the parliamentary session. I would like to thank them, ”concluded Ms. Malavoy.
The last step could be taken by Friday, when Bill 23 will be voted on in the National Assembly.
