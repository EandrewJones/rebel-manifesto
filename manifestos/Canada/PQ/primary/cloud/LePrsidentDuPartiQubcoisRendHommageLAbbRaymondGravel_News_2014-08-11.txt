“It is with sadness that I learned of the death of Father Raymond Gravel. Several of us discovered him during his time in the House of Commons as a member of the Bloc Québécois. We have seen an upright man in action, with a sincere and unwavering commitment.
These qualities, revealed to all Quebecers, had nevertheless been known for years by many Lanaudois; throughout his priestly life, he had served them with the same ardor, the same smile, the same enthusiasm.
In recent months, although suffering, Father Gravel has made a point of reappearing sporadically in the news, as if to tell us that even diminished by illness, we must never give in to fate. An exercise in humility that has moved more than one.
Today, in my name and in the name of the members of the Parti Québécois, I would like to salute the worthy example that Father Gravel will have given us throughout his public life. &quot;
