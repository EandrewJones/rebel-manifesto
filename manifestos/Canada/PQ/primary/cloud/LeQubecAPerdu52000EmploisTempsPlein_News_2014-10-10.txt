The member for Rousseau and the official opposition spokesperson for finance, Nicolas Marceau, the member for Saint-Jérôme and the spokesperson for the economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, and the deputy for Saint-Jean and spokesperson for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, demand that Prime Minister Philippe Couillard come out of his torpor and take concrete action to boost job creation in Quebec.
The stagnation of the labor market continues in Quebec, as does the plunge in full-time employment. Since the arrival of the Liberal government, 51,900 full-time jobs have been lost.
“While our neighbors create jobs, Quebec is lagging behind. This is likely to continue since all the government is proposing is a drifting North Plan, as well as a maritime strategy and a free trade agreement with Europe which will not create jobs for several years. », Declared Nicolas Marceau.
A damaging liberal effect for Quebeckers The member for Saint-Jérôme once again emphasizes that the liberal effect has brought Quebeckers nothing but stagnation in the economy.
“The Liberal government has abandoned the economic policies launched by the Parti Québécois government. Since then, employment has been bad in Quebec. The biggest cuts since the Liberals came to power have been made in the economic mission of the state. They must admit their mistake, take control and table an economic policy this fall, ”claimed Pierre Karl Péladeau.
