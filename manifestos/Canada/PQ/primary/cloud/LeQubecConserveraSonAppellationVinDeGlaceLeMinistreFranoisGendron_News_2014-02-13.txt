Quebec - The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr. François Gendron, welcomes the publication in the Canada Gazette by the federal government of the regulation defining “ice wine” like a wine that is made exclusively from grapes naturally frozen on the vine. The Canadian definition is inclusive and will therefore allow Quebec to keep its name “ice wine”.
“I welcome this news with great satisfaction, especially since the federal government recognizes regional differences in climatic and agricultural conditions in Canada. The discussions over the past few months, and particularly those I have had with my counterpart, Mr. Gerry Ritz, have therefore borne fruit. I am very happy with the turn of events, ”said François Gendron. The publication of the new regulations will put an end to a period of uncertainty for Quebec winegrowers.
The reserved designation process &quot;Quebec Ice Wine&quot; that will be initiated for the 2014 vintage will protect the authenticity of the product and respond to the request of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food of Canada, Mr. Gerry Ritz, namely that the provincial certification systems put in place ensure that the grapes have frozen naturally on the vine.
