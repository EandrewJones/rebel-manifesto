Quebec - The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, announces his intention to intervene in the American procedure under which the American company Montreal Maine &amp; Atlantic Railway Ltd has placed itself under the protection of the chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Code.
Quebec&#39;s approach aims to protect the interests of disaster victims, the City of Lac-Mégantic and all Quebecers since the government of Quebec has made a commitment to do everything in its power to ensure that disaster victims are compensated and that the costs of the decontamination and reconstruction of downtown Lac-Mégantic not be borne by the citizens of Quebec.
Quebec has taken the initiative to bring together an informal creditors&#39; committee made up of disaster victims who are members of the class action suit, the City of Lac-Mégantic and the Quebec government. The members of this informal committee mandated Me Luc Despins of the Paul Hastings firm to make representations before the American court and ask this court and the US Trustee Office to officially recognize this creditors committee.
Me Despins is a member of the Quebec Bar and the New York State Bar who has practiced in the United States for nearly 25 years and specializes in bankruptcy and insolvency law. He notably represented the creditors committee set up in the Enron bankruptcy case.
“The Quebec government intends to take the best measures to recover as much as possible from those responsible for this tragedy. All our actions are oriented towards the ultimate benefit of the victims. The team of lawyers dedicated to this task has been working since the first hours following the Lac-Mégantic tragedy to ensure that the rights of victims and citizens of Quebec are preserved, ”Minister Bertrand St-Arnaud concluded.
