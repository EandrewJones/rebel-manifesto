Quebec - The Premier of Quebec, Ms. Pauline Marois, took advantage of her presence at the lunch of the Coalition on Food Sovereignty, held this morning on the sidelines of the 88th General Congress of the UPA, to reiterate her desire to quickly endow Quebec of a food sovereignty policy.
“Any self-respecting people must take care of their agriculture. More than just reacting to one-off crises, we need a vision for the future. This is what I asked my colleague François Gendron to develop, ”declared the Prime Minister.
Ms. Marois summarized the objectives of the policy in these terms. “The goal of food sovereignty is first and foremost to ensure that Quebecers have a supply of quality, inexpensive food that is good for their health. It is also the dynamic occupation of the territory and the creation of jobs. We have set ourselves an ambitious objective: to ensure that the food produced here falls from 33% to 50% of the grocery basket of Quebecers, ”said the Prime Minister.
The policy, on which the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is currently working, will revolve around four main axes:
“We have great faith in our agrifood sector and we intend to make every effort, in concert with local artisans, to ensure its full development from an economic perspective, but also from a sustainable development perspective. This policy will benefit producers and processors, but also consumers who increasingly taste local products, ”added Ms. Marois.
Due in particular to its undeniable advantages in economic and environmental terms, the promotion of local purchasing will occupy an important place in the policy. The development of reserved appellations and the preservation of cultivable land will also be part of it, as will the maintenance of family farms and, more specifically, support for the next generation of farmers.
