Québec, November 5, 2019 - While the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Andrée Laforest, is preparing to pass Bill 16, which aims, among other things, to reform the Régie du logement, the member for Rimouski and Parti Québécois housing spokesperson Harold LeBel says he rightly raises questions within tenants&#39; rights groups. &quot;In fact, and from what we heard during the consultations, this law does not go far enough and will not really make life easier for tenants,&quot; he said.
IN SHORT
This morning, members of the Regroupement des committees logement et associations de tenants du Québec (RCLALQ) will gather in front of Mr. LeBel&#39;s constituency office to present their version of a reform of the Régie du logement. Held in Quebec City because of parliamentary work, the member nevertheless wishes to offer them his support. “For the Régie du logement, which will become an administrative tribunal, it takes more than a name change; It takes real, in-depth reform, as the list of necessary and legitimate RCLALQ proposals proves, ”he said.
Even if they are at the heart of the MP&#39;s demands, and have done so for several years, many issues have still not been tackled head-on by the government: accessibility of services, especially in the regions, protection of the rights of tenants and waiting times for those who want to assert them, rent control, eviction processes and the conduct of hearings before the Régie, in particular.
Bill 16 is an omnibus bill; it concerns not only the Régie du logement, but also co-ownership, the Building Code and municipal affairs. However, Harold LeBel believes that special attention should have been paid to the Régie. “I attended the consultations, and I consider that the issues surrounding, among other things, access to the services of the Régie du logement should have been dealt with more specifically. I therefore ask the Minister to seriously consider RCLALQ&#39;s demands, ”insisted Harold LeBel.
