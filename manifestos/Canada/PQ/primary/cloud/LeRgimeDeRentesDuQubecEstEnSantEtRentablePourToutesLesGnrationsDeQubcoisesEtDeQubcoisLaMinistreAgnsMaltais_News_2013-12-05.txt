Quebec - The Minister of Labor, Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity and Minister responsible for the Régie des rentes du Québec, Ms. Agnès Maltais, is delighted with the results of the Actuarial valuation of the Quebec Pension Plan as of December 31 2012 tabled this morning in the National Assembly. This document must be produced every three years by the Régie des rentes du Québec to assess the financial situation of the Plan created in 1966.
“The Quebec Pension Plan is healthy and profitable for all generations of Quebeckers,” explained the Minister.
&quot;This evaluation shows that the contribution rate forecast for 2017 is approaching the break-even contribution rate, which is excellent news,&quot; said Minister Maltais. This rate stabilizes in the long term the ratio between the reserve and the outflows.
Last year, the Régie des rentes du Québec paid out $ 11.2 billion to 1,745,000 beneficiaries. More than 4 million Quebec workers contribute to the Quebec Pension Plan.
The actuarial valuation as at December 31, 2012 can be consulted on the website of the Régie des rentes du Québec at www.rrq.gouv.qc.ca.
