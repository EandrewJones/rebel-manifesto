Quebec– The Parti Québécois spokesperson for public security, Pascal Bérubé, asks the Minister of Public Security to put the Police Service of the City of Montreal (SPVM) under supervision.
“It is essential to restore public confidence in this police force. This is why the Parti Québécois is calling for the SPVM to be placed under immediate supervision, until all light is shed on the extremely serious allegations which continue to multiply in the media. The minister should not be afraid to use all possible remedies, instead of improvising by adding here and there elements to a police investigation of the police. He is still unable to reiterate his confidence in Philippe Pichet. If the minister does not have confidence, how could it be otherwise for us? He must take the situation in hand when, let us remember, it was the SPVM which, from the start, mandated the SQ to investigate itself. We are therefore proposing to appoint people of trust to head the SPVM to restore order in the cabin, as was done after the Poitras commission report, ”said Pascal Bérubé.
“From the start, the minister has only reacted to media crises and is now asking us to be patient. This is not the way things are going to happen. We therefore call on him once again to turn the investigation over to the Bureau of Independent Investigations, as permitted by the Police Act. In order to restore the confidence of the population, we must avoid at all costs the police investigating the police. Thus, there are only two things for the Minister to do: first, he must take control of the situation with a guardianship that will ensure the end of the irregularities and, second, to carry out an investigation completely independent of the BEI. He must act quickly, because these allegations overshadow the rigorous work done by many police officers, ”concluded the deputy.
