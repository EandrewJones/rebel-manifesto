Quebec - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for international relations, Carole Poirier, and the MNA for Bourget and spokesperson for immigration, Maka Kotto, once again asked the Minister of Immigration, Diversity and Inclusion, Kathleen Weil, to quickly issue a selection certificate from Quebec for humanitarian reasons to Mr. Raif Badawi.
“Saudi Arabia confirmed, a few days ago, the sentence of 10 years in prison, 1,000 lashes and a fine of $ 300,000 that it imposes on blogger Raif Badawi. Therefore, and to make things happen, we must use all the means at our disposal, even the most exceptional. This is what we asked the Minister last Friday, and again this morning, ”said Carole Poirier.
&quot;We invite the Minister of Immigration to issue a selection certificate from Quebec for humanitarian reasons to Mr. Badawi in order, on the one hand, to make Mr. Badawi a true Quebecer by adoption, and, on the other hand , to get the federal government to invest more to concretely help this father of three to get out of this hell and reunite with his family in Quebec, ”added Maka Kotto.
“It is very important that the Government of Quebec quickly agree to our request. In this way, we will send a strong signal in support of Mr. Badawi&#39;s family and urge Ottawa to take more tangible action. This deplorable case deserves that we take all possible initiatives to help this family, ”concluded Carole Poirier.
The Quebec Selection Certificate is a document issued by the Ministry of Immigration, Diversity and Inclusion confirming the selection of an immigrant candidate wishing to settle permanently in Quebec. The Minister can decide to grant it on humanitarian grounds, thus speeding up the usual procedure.
