Longueuil - “We have a duty to remember. René Lévesque was a great premier, an important player in the social and economic progress of Quebec. He was as much a great defender of our national identity as an excellent member for Longueuil ”. It is in these terms that the Minister of Democratic Institutions and Citizen Participation and Member of Parliament for Marie-Victorin, Mr. Bernard Drainville, welcomed the decision of the Commission de toponymie to designate a section of Route 132 by the name of René-Lévesque highway. The Minister also paid tribute to the work of the Historical and Cultural Society of Marigot, and mainly its president, Mr. Michel Pratt, for this great initiative.
“From the start of the discussions, I fully supported this project and mentioned the importance I attached to it. More than a designation, it is a way of making known the heritage of this statesman. When we think of René Lévesque, we think in particular of the nationalization of electricity and the creation of Hydro-Québec, the reform of the method of financing political parties, the law on agricultural zoning, the automobile insurance, to Bill 101… But, mainly, René Lévesque will be remembered as the one who for a long time embodied the idea of making Quebec a country. Moreover, the many support received for this initiative demonstrates the gratitude that the people of Quebec feel for this man, ”said Mr. Drainville.
It should be remembered that until its creation in 1980, the current riding of Marie-Victorin, represented by Mr. Bernard Drainville, was partly included in the riding of Taillon.
Mr. René Lévesque founded the Parti Québécois in 1968. He was Member of Parliament for Taillon and Premier of Quebec from 1976 to 1985. He died in 1987.
