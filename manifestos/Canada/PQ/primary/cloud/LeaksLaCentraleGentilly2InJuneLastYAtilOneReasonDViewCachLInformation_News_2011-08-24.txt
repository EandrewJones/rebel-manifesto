Quebec - The member for Marie-Victorin and official opposition critic for energy, Bernard Drainville, seriously questions the attitude of the senior management of Hydro-Quebec who hid a major leak in Gentilly 2 plant last June, causing the plant to shut down for several days.
“It&#39;s about the health and safety of people. If the incident that occurred last June was trivial as we are told, why did you hide it from the public? Hydro management&#39;s explanations are insufficient, ”said Bernard Drainville.
The member for Marie-Victorin also wonders if the Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, was aware of this incident. &quot;Either she was aware and preferred to be an accomplice of the senior management of Hydro-Quebec and hide the information from Quebecers, or else she was not, which is not reassuring,&quot; said he continued.
Mr. Drainville notes in passing that it has been more than six months since the crown corporation sent out a host of documents on the future of the nuclear power plant, but Minister Normandeau is keeping them secret. It should also be remembered that the Parti Québécois has repeatedly called for a parliamentary commission on Gentilly 2 in order to take cognizance of the studies and reports concerning the possible refurbishment of the nuclear power plant.
“Last March, faced with colossal cost overruns and the plant&#39;s real utility in Quebec&#39;s energy portfolio, Hydro-Quebec did not rule out the total closure of the plant. We have come out in favor of shutting down the plant; Quebec has considerable advantages in terms of renewable and green energies and does not need the nuclear industry. Those who accuse us of being careless about job losses are in bad faith: Hydro-Québec is a state-owned company sufficiently developed to reintegrate these people into other divisions, after the closure work that will last for several years. », Concluded the member for Marie-Victorin.
