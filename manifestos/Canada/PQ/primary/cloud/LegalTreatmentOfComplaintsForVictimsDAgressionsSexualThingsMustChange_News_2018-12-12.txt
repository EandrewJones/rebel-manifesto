In reaction to the decision of the Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions (DPCP) to lay charges against Mr. Gilbert Rozon in a single file and to drop 13 others, the member for Joliette and spokesperson for the second opposition group in justice matters, Véronique Hivon, urges the Minister of Justice, Sonia LeBel, to set up a working group that would include legal and psychosocial experts, elected officials from all political parties, lawyers from the defense as well as representatives of the judiciary and the DPCP to assess all possible solutions in order to respond to the deep questioning that arises, the problem of trust and the mismatch between the justice system and the reality of victims of sexual assault .
IN SHORT
· Victims feel abandoned by the justice system; there is a mismatch between their reality and the functioning of the system.
· More than ever, solutions must be found to improve the handling of sexual assault complaints.
· Véronique Hivon calls on Minister LeBel to set up a working group.
· The idea of a specialized court in matters of sexual and domestic violence should be studied.
“We must act to rebuild trust and offer responses to the feeling of incomprehension and impunity that pervades the victims. It is our responsibility, as representatives of the population, to question ourselves and act in the wake of the #moiaussi movement. We must also respond to the courage shown by all those who have spoken publicly for things to change. I invite the Minister to convene a working group to find solutions for the victims, ”said Véronique Hivon from the outset.
“According to CALACS, the centers for assistance and the fight against sexual assault, only 5% of sexual assaults are reported to the police. And only 3 in 1,000 complaints will ultimately lead to a conviction. In this context, the minister cannot simply say that the system is working, that we must maintain confidence and invite victims to report. There is obviously a problem somewhere, ”insisted the member for Joliette.
“At the Parti Québécois, since last year we have been proposing the establishment of a specialized tribunal within the Court of Quebec so that the specific reality of victims of sexual or conjugal violence is taken into account, that the rules of practice can be adapted and that the specialization of all those involved is acquired. This tribunal could also better take into account the needs of victims in terms of processes and sentences, and, for example, give more significant place to the principles of restorative justice, ”added the spokesperson.
The #moiaussi movement has led to an unprecedented wave of denunciations of sex crimes. “As elected officials, I repeat that we have a responsibility to act and be a vector of change to put an end to the culture of silence and the feeling of shame that gnaws at too many Quebec victims. And, above all, to restore confidence in our justice system. I extend my hand to the Minister so that we work in a non-partisan manner in this direction, in the best interests of the victims, ”concluded Véronique Hivon.
