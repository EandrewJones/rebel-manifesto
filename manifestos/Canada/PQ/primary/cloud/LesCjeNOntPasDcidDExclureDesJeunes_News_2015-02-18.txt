Quebec - The member for Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, says that contrary to what Minister François Blais claimed yesterday , not all young people will be able to continue to receive the services of carrefours jeunesse-emploi (CJE).
“The government has imposed conditions on the CJEs. The result is clear to everyone, except for the minister: young people will be excluded from the services offered by the CJEs. It may well be issuing press releases saying that all is well, it is not reality. The reform leaves out young people. However, in the current context - where job losses are piling up in all regions of Quebec and where the number of young people on social assistance has increased by 14.4% in one year - more young people than ever need all the services possible to enter the job market, ”said Dave Turcotte.
For example, the CJE Papineau, in Outaouais, affirms that with the reform, only 25% of its clientele will be able to continue to be welcomed. The CJEs of Nord-du-Québec, Côte-Nord, Chaudière-Appalaches, Gaspésie, Îles-de-la-Madeleine and Abitibi-Témiscamingue will see their budget cut by 10%.
“With these budget cuts, how are we going to be able to help all young people? On the ground, the harmful effects of liberal austerity are visible. All young people between 16 and 35 must have access to quality services. The change of mission of the CJEs goes in the wrong direction. Unfortunately, it was imposed on these organizations, despite strong opposition, everywhere in Quebec, ”concluded Dave Turcotte.
