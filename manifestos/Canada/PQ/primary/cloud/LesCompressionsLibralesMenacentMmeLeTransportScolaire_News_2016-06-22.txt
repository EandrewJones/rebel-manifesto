Montreal - As a new coalition of parents for the maintenance of school transportation is formed in the Montreal region, the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in education and Member of Parliament for Lac-Saint-Jean, Alexandre Cloutier, is keen to offer him support, as well as that of the Parti Québécois.
“I met the coalition on Monday in Montreal. These parents are overwhelmed by the loss of school transportation services in the metropolitan area. Nearly 700 students from three special-purpose schools in Montreal could be deprived of school transportation next September. With the accumulation of Liberal cuts, school boards must now cut school transportation; this is insane! », Explained the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
Like several other groups that have formed to denounce the cuts in education since the Liberals came to power, these parents have no other choice but to mobilize to defend these essential services for their children.
“The contribution required to maintain school transportation could reach $ 600 per child. Such a tariff - or, worse, the complete absence of school transportation - would create a two-tier public system. These supposedly public schools would only be accessible to children whose parents can pay the bill. The government must review its funding to guarantee universal accessibility of public schools to all Quebecers, ”concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
