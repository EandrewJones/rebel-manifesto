Quebec - On October 19, ten elected municipal officials became federal deputies. Several by-elections will therefore be called in these municipalities. The member for Jonquière and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in municipal affairs, Sylvain Gaudreault, asks the government to call its Bill 53, in connection with political financing at this level.
“I tabled Bill 53 when I was Minister of Municipal Affairs, a week after the 2013 municipal elections. At the time, we wanted elected municipal officials to be subject to the same rules as elected representatives of the National Assembly, by reducing the maximum threshold for donations to $ 100. Thus, we wanted to ensure that the influence of money on our decision-makers is reduced to its maximum. But the election of the Liberals and the appointment of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Pierre Moreau, ensured that the file was shelved, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
After scandals surrounding political financing, in Laval, Montreal, Boisbriand and Mascouche, among others, the Parti Québécois government had passed Bill 26, establishing a transitional municipal political financing regime for the 2013 elections. plan increased the limit on personal donations from $ 1,000 to $ 300. Subsequently, we proposed a permanent funding regime, through Bill 53.
“From 2012 to 2014, we did the cleaning that the Liberals always refused to do. Since then, we have been reverting to the good old Liberal regime. The Charbonneau commission report is coming up, and by-elections will soon be called in several municipalities. Minister Moreau should send a strong signal against corruption, but he is doing just the opposite: this morning he refused to commit to limiting donations to $ 100 to the municipal government. It&#39;s time to act. I offer my full cooperation to the Minister so that Bill 53 is adopted before Christmas, ”concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
