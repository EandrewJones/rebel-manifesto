Quebec City, September 8, 2016 - Harold LeBel, Member of Parliament for Rimouski and Parti Québécois spokesperson on the social economy, was present at the World Social Economy Forum in Montreal, where several participants stressed that the abolition of CRÉ, CLDs and other regional structures undermine the development of the social economy.
“The social economy goes through local development, anchoring projects in the community, democratic management and collective ownership. It takes mobilizing agents and regional consultation. The abolition of CRÉs and CLDs had a dramatic effect on the development of the social economy in several regions of Quebec, ”said the Member for Rimouski.
Let us recall that the recognition of the social economy in Quebec dates from an economic summit held by the government of the Parti Québécois in 1996. It is also a government of the Parti Québécois which adopted the first framework law on the social economy, in 2013. &quot;We are proud to participate in the 2016 World Social Economy Forum. The Parti Québécois has always supported the development of the social economy and we will continue to do so when we form the government again,&quot; concluded Harold LeBel.
