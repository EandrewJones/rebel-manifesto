Quebec - On the occasion of the Global March for the Climate in Quebec, members of the Parti Québécois will join their voices to that of thousands of citizens in favor of the fight against climate change.
The member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and the environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, would like to point out that Quebec must continue its efforts in the fight against climate change. He participated in the march held in Tadoussac, for the protection and preservation of the St. Lawrence River and the species that depend on it, in the context of the TransCanada pipeline project.
“We have the power to become a leader in this fight. Quebec must make its own decisions about what is happening on its territory. The environment falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Quebec, ”he declared.
Held as part of the Climate Summit, which will take place in New York next Tuesday, the World March mobilizes people in more than 130 countries. The citizens of some twenty Quebec cities join in.
“This walk is also an opportunity to remind the Minister of Sustainable Development, the Environment and the Fight against Climate Change that Quebec&#39;s environmental rules must be respected and that it is his responsibility to ensure them. In the TransCanada pipeline file, we have repeatedly asked the minister to stop work at Gros-Cacouna and immediately hold a BAPE on the entire project. Will Minister Heurtel finally listen? ”Sylvain Gaudreault concluded.
