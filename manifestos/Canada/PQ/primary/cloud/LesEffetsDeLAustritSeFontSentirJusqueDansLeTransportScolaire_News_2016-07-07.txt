The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of education and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, asks the Minister of Education to review his funding for school transportation to ensure that schools The specific vocation of the Commission scolaire de Montréal (CSDM) remain accessible to all students, regardless of their situation.
“Nearly 700 students who attend special purpose public schools will be deprived of school transportation for the next year. This is another consequence of the Liberal government&#39;s repeated cuts in the budgets of our education system. After direct services to students, the network is at the point of cutting school transport. It&#39;s deplorable, ”said Alexandre Cloutier.
Parents of students who attend Face, Atelier and Fernand-Seguin schools in Montreal have just learned this news. Despite their mobilization and their efforts, the Minister of Education remained frozen in the face of their request.
“The minister cannot sit idly by. It must quickly review its funding for school transportation. The government of Quebec has chosen to open public schools with a special vocation; it is therefore his duty to ensure that they are accessible to all students by providing adequate transportation. The current situation presents parents with an impossible choice for the next school year: to uproot their children or to scramble to transport them morning and evening. This shows us, once again, that education is unfortunately far from being a priority for this government, ”said the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
