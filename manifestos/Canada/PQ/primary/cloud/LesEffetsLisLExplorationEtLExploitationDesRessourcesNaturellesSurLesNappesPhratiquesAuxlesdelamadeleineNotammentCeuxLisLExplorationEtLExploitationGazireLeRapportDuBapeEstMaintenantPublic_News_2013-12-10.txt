Quebec - At the request of the Minister of Sustainable Development, the Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet, the Office of Public Hearings on the Environment (BAPE) is releasing its report today investigation and public hearing on the effects linked to the exploration and exploitation of natural resources on groundwater in the Magdalen Islands, in particular those linked to gas exploration and exploitation. This mandate of investigation and public hearing began on May 14. The commission of inquiry was chaired by Michel Germain who was assisted by commissioner Jacques Locat.
The BAPE commission of inquiry concludes that the territory of the Magdalen Islands is, by definition, an island space with its specificities, including a relatively small living space, a fragile ecological environment and a significant distance from the main urban centers of Quebec. The Madelinot archipelago therefore appears to be more vulnerable than all the other communities in Quebec, from an economic, social and environmental point of view. In this regard, aquifers are irreplaceable, as they are the only source of good quality drinking water available at reasonable cost.
Consequently, the archipelago&#39;s water resources should be targeted by reinforced regulations. In addition, these could be protected by the implementation of management and conservation plans administered by an appointed organization, in particular the future regional concertation table for the integrated management of the St. Lawrence in the Magdalen Islands.
In addition, the Ministère du Développement durable, de l&#39;Environnement, de la Faune et des Parcs should participate in the process of granting permits for the drilling and completion of gas and oil wells, especially if there is stimulation of wells, given the fragility of the archipelago&#39;s drinking water supply.
The use of fossil fuels is omnipresent on the Madelinot territory. A reduction in their use would be beneficial for the protection of groundwater. An energy strategy specific to the Magdalen Islands deserves to be developed, because it could help reduce the presence of these fuels. The commission of inquiry encourages the Madelinots to continue developing this strategy.
Finally, the committee stresses that the Madelinots wish to have their say on the place that the gas and oil industry could take without compromising the sustainability of natural and human environments and without weakening existing economic activities, in particular tourism and fisheries.
Remember that during the first part of the public hearing, the commission held five public sessions in L&#39;Étang-du-Nord. In the second part, two public sessions enabled the commission to attend the presentation of 16 briefs and 6 oral opinions. A total of 24 briefs were submitted to it by individuals, groups, organizations and municipalities interested in this subject.
The investigation and public hearing report on the effects related to the exploration and exploitation of natural resources on groundwater in the Magdalen Islands, in particular those related to gas exploration and exploitation is now available.
