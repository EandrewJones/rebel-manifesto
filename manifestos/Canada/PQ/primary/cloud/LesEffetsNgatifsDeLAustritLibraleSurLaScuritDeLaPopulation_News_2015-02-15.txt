Quebec - The member for Sanguinet and official opposition spokesperson for the Treasury Board, Alain Therrien, denounces the restrictions imposed by the President of the Treasury Board, Martin Coiteux, on government employees with regard to their travel; we are also beginning to see the negative impacts on the safety of citizens.
“Since November 25, employee travel has been severely limited; in fact, they are staying in their offices, and the effects of this austerity measure are starting to be felt. The safety of citizens can be compromised, for example when fire prevention inspectors from the Public Security can no longer travel to the centers for the elderly to ensure that they meet standards, or when inspectors from the MAPAQ cannot can no longer do inspections in restaurants. The people responsible for applying and respecting our laws must be able to go into the field, ”said Alain Therrien.
The member also wonders about other ministries, which must apply the same directive:
“What Martin Coiteux is doing by cutting off travel and forcing the authorization of the deputy minister to refuel departmental cars is called lack of discernment, not seeing beyond the tip of your nose. Today, he must correct the situation so that the people who work to enforce our laws can properly accomplish their tasks. The Minister must reassure Quebeckers, who are now seeing the effects of austerity on their security and their environment, ”concluded Alain Therrien.
