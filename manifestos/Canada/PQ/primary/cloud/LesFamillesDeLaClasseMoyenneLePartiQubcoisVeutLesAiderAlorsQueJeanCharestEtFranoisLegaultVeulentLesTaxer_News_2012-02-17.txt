Quebec - The member for Rousseau and official opposition critic for finance and economic development, Nicolas Marceau, criticizes Jean Charest and François Legault for wanting to overwhelm middle-class families by maintaining the health tax.
“Rather than acknowledging that the health tax imposed by the Liberal government in 2010 was a very bad idea, Jean Charest and François Legault are determined to dip into the pockets of middle-class families, already quite the victims of multiple rate hikes. during the last years. Unlike the Liberals and the Caquists, the Parti Québécois intends to help the middle class; we are going to abolish the health tax, ”declared Nicolas Marceau.
The official opposition has been denouncing this regressive tax for two years, which does not take into account the income of taxpayers. &quot;It makes no sense that those who have an annual income of $ 30,000 pay the same amount as those who earn $ 1 million,&quot; continued Nicolas Marceau. By abolishing the health tax, middle-class families would benefit from an additional $ 400 to make ends meet.
The member for Rousseau still cannot believe hearing the Liberal members claim that $ 400 is an easy sum to pay. “Closing a family budget has become more and more difficult. Jean Charest&#39;s Liberals have gotten so much out of Quebeckers&#39; pockets that they no longer realize the harmful effect that this represents. What is worrying is that François Legault seems to want to do worse than the Liberals, ”noted the spokesperson.
“The Parti Québécois believes that those who have the financial means should do their fair share in the health fund, according to their income. It&#39;s easy to understand, but the CAQ of François Legault and the liberals of Jean Charest maintain that it is up to the middle class to pay. They will have to explain their choice, ”concluded Nicolas Marceau.
