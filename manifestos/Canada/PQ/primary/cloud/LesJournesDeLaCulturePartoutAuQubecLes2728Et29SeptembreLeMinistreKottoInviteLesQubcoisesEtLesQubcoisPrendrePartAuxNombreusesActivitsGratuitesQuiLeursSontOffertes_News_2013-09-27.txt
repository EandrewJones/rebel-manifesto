Quebec - With his presence at the kickoff of the 17th Journées de la culture, the Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, today marks the launch. A much-anticipated fall rendezvous each year, the Journées de la Culture will take place across Quebec for three days. The Ministry of Culture and Communications is one of the major partners of this event, its financial contribution amounts to $ 315,000.
“The Journées de la culture are intended to be a unique opportunity to discover the cultural and artistic richness of Quebec and to benefit from it. This festive gathering is also the perfect opportunity to see the world of arts and culture from a different perspective and to become aware of its importance as a vehicle for affirming identity. Culture is part of our daily life and we are surrounded by art. I warmly invite citizens to participate in some 3,000 activities offered in more than 350 communities across Quebec. There is something for everyone, ”Minister Kotto said.
The Minister would like to point out that culture is an important source of wealth in Quebec and has social, economic and tourist benefits. Its contribution to the Quebec economy amounts to $ 13.2 billion, or 4.34% of the GDP. Nearly 165,000 people work in the culture and communications sectors so that the Quebec public has access to a wide variety of cultural offerings.
The non-profit organization Culture pour tous is mandated to coordinate the holding of the Journées de la culture, established by decree of the National Assembly in 1998 by the government of the Parti Québécois, to underline the importance of culture for the identity and development of Quebec.
