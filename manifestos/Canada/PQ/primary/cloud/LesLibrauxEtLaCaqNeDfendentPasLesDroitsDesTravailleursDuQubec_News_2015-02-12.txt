Quebec - The member for Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, as well as the member for Verchères and critic for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, deplore the fact that the Liberal government and the CAQ refused to support workers in Quebec when tabling a motion this morning on employment insurance.
“The Liberal government and the CAQ refused to support our motion denouncing Service Canada&#39;s practices whereby civil servants discourage unemployed workers from claiming benefits. These two parties have again decided to support Canada and federalism instead of workers in Quebec; this is unacceptable! These people are entitled to their benefits, and it is completely illogical that officials do not support them, ”said Dave Turcotte.
“The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, François Blais, must intervene with his federal counterpart so that these practices stop. Once again, Ottawa is hurting workers on the employment insurance file. This bad federal habit is unfortunately nothing new, but the Quebec government has a duty to intervene to defend our workers, ”added Stéphane Bergeron.
The motion rejected by the PLQ and the CAQ reads as follows:
“That the National Assembly disapprove of the practices adopted by the federal government related to the reform of employment insurance which encourage Service Canada employees to do everything possible to discourage unemployed workers from claiming benefits;
That it ask the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity to intervene with his federal counterpart so that he abandons these practices. &quot;
