Quebec - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for seniors, Carole Poirier, is discouraged by the vacuum that emerges from the announcement made by Minister Blais. &quot;It is as if the government had said &#39;quickly, we must seem to be activating for the elderly&quot; and that it had improvised a plan from a collection of measures which in fact seem good only for electoral purposes, but which ultimately do not meet the urgent needs of our seniors, ”said Carole Poirier.
For months, the Parti Québécois has deplored the reduction of 200,000 hours in home care, the numerous cases of neglect in private residences and CHSLDs as well as the shortcomings in terms of staff training and the organization of care.
This policy in no way resolves the problems raised by the Ombudsperson last month. &quot;The erratic management of this government in home support services, the capping of hours of care, the non-respect of expert evaluations regarding the needs of vulnerable people and regional inequities remain realities for which the government does not provide no immediate solutions, ”continued the MP for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
“It is shameful to spend five years preparing a plan so devoid of financial means. Does Minister Blais listen so little to the part of the President of the Conseil du trésor? Do the Liberal priorities not include the well-being of our seniors? Is Jean Charest insensitive to the legitimate demand of seniors to age at home? », Asked Carole Poirier.
“Long before Minister Blais presented her policy, the Parti Québécois made clear and solid proposals to take care of our seniors, in particular the creation of a home care and services network and an autonomy fund, in addition to the adoption of a real policy on aging and the elderly, ”recalled Carole Poirier.
