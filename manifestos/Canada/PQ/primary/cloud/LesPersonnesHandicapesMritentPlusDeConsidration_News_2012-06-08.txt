Quebec - &quot;How can we take so much pleasure in statistics to become blind to reality,&quot; denounced the member for Saint-Hyacinthe and official opposition spokesperson for people with disabilities, Émilien Pelletier, in reaction to Minister Vien&#39;s answers to the questions he asked her in the House this morning about access to services for people with disabilities.
“People with disabilities and their families are confronted every day with various problems: difficulties in accessing specialized services, cuts in home services, waiting times, inaccessibility of public transport and several public places. The Minister must stop turning a deaf ear and act without delay, ”said Émilien Pelletier.
Yesterday, the Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse confirmed the persistence of inequities and obstacles to overcome for the employment of disabled people. To achieve the objectives set, public bodies in Quebec should triple the representation of people with disabilities in their workforce over the next few years.
“The situation is worrying. Whether in terms of employment or access to services, everything must be done to make equality a reality for people with disabilities in Quebec, ”concluded Émilien Pelletier.
