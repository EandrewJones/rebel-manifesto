Quebec - Dissatisfied with the lack of public explanations concerning the conclusions of the Charbonneau report, the leader of the official opposition and the Parti Québécois spokesperson on ethics, Bernard Drainville, asks the government to agree to his request so that the members of the Committee on Institutions can hear the President of the Commission on the awarding and management of public contracts in the construction industry (CEIC), France Charbonneau, as well as Commissioner Renaud Lachance.
According to Mr. Drainville, the context of dissent in which this report was produced undermined the process and raised serious doubts as to its validity. All the light must be shed, not only on the dissent between the members of the commission, but also on the financing of the Liberal Party of Quebec, which is doing too well. “Quebecers are outraged. They feel like they have been duped and wonder if they paid $ 45 million for a commission that ultimately served to whitewash the Liberal Party, ”said the member for Marie-Victorin.
The leader of the official opposition therefore asked that the members of the Committee on Institutions be assembled in order to hear, as soon as possible, the President of the CEIC, France Charbonneau, as well as Commissioner Renaud Lachance. &quot;We believe that it is our responsibility to ensure that all the questions raised by the work and the CEIC report are answered, particularly as to the reasons which prompted Mr. Lachance to express his dissent concerning a significant part of the conclusions of the Commission. We must do everything to understand what happened and ensure that this exercise, which cost Quebecers millions of dollars, was not in vain, ”concluded the spokesperson.
