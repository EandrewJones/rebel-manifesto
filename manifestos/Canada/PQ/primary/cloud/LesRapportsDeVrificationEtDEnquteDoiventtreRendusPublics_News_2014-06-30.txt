Québec, June 30, 2014 - The member for Marie-Victorin and official opposition spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, asked the president and CEO of Hydro-Québec, Thierry Vandal , and to the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Pierre Arcand, to make public as quickly as possible the internal investigation and audit reports on the awarding of contracts at Hydro-Québec.
During the study of budget appropriations, Bernard Drainville questioned Thierry Vandal and Minister Arcand about the testimony heard at the Charbonneau commission indicating that engineering firms that contributed to political parties had been awarded contracts from Hydro-Quebec. .
&quot;In a spirit of transparency, we have the right to know whether there has been collusion, corruption or any other form of embezzlement in the awarding of contracts at Hydro-Québec, a company which, I remind you, belongs to all Quebecker, ”said Bernard Drainville.
Questioned on this subject, Thierry Vandal also confirmed that cases of embezzlement had led to dismissals and disciplinary measures within the state corporation, without however being able to give an example.
“We are concerned about the refusal of the CEO of Hydro-Québec and Minister Arcand to commit to making public the content of the internal investigation and audit reports. They also refuse to provide us with a timeline. All we are being told is that cases of embezzlement have already taken place and that the Crown corporation is working with UPAC and the Charbonneau commission, ”concluded the member for Marie-Victorin.
