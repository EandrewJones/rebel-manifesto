Quebec - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for international relations, Carole Poirier, denounces the Liberal government&#39;s intention to transform the Ministère des Relations internationales et de la Francophonie (MRIF) into a secretariat .
“It&#39;s purely ideological. The Liberals are using budgetary austerity to justify cuts aimed at reducing Quebec&#39;s powers, with the tacit support of the CAQ. For Philippe Couillard, Quebec should only be a Canadian province like any other. Cutting off the MRIF means reducing Quebec&#39;s influence abroad, not only culturally, but also economically. Quebec&#39;s international relations are not partisan; they are done in the interest of all Quebecers, ”said Carole Poirier.
The deputy recalls that the Gérin-Lajoie doctrine, relating to the international extension of Quebec&#39;s internal competences, has been promoted and supported by all the successive governments since 1965. The Liberal Party would thus put an end to decades of Quebec&#39;s action abroad.
“The MRIF is a development tool for Quebec. Without him, could Quebec have made progress on the issue of cultural diversity? Could Quebec have influenced the free trade agreements with Europe, or the hundreds of bilateral agreements concluded with as many countries? », Added the deputy.
According to Carole Poirier, the Liberal government is once again showing its lack of vision for the future of Quebec. “International action is what has enabled our creators, our businesses and our artists to grow and develop on the world stage. I ask the Prime Minister to clearly state that the MRIF will not be transformed into a secretariat, and that it will retain its status and all its powers, ”she concluded.
