Quebec - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of regional development and fisheries, Gaétan Lelièvre, accompanied by several of his colleagues, said he was devastated by the figures of the most recent demographic assessment of the resource regions of Quebec.
In fact, the data from the Institut de la statistique du Québec (ISQ) on the situation in our regions are alarming. Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Saguenay – Lac-Saint-Jean, Côte-Nord, Gaspésie – Îles-de-la-Madeleine and Bas-Saint-Laurent show negative demographic results. Despite this, the government continues to demonstrate, day after day, its indifference to the issue and its lack of understanding of the reality on the ground.
“All the resource regions show a negative demographic balance for the past year. However, while our regions are emptying, the Liberals continue to ax their development tools. The ISQ figures are, however, tangible proof that their marketing plans, the Plan Nord and the Maritime Strategy, are nothing but window dressing and bring nothing positive to our regions. It is even the opposite effect that occurs: while the liberals concentrate on their advertising strategies, they let the regions die, ”declared Gaétan Lelièvre.
“It is particularly easy to demonstrate that the Liberals do not understand the regions at all: the Minister of Land Occupancy and the Minister responsible for Regional Economic Development are two elected officials from the Island of Montreal. In short, who is rising in the Council of Ministers to defend our regions? Who knows their reality? », Asked Gaétan Lelièvre.
“The government has a duty to listen to stakeholders in the regions, in order to deliver, without delay, a real development strategy for the resource regions. In addition, concrete measures must quickly be launched to promote their socioeconomic growth, ”concluded the Member for Gaspé.
