Quebec - Sylvain Roy, MP for Bonaventure and official opposition spokesperson for forests, and François Gendron, MP for Abitibi-Ouest, denounce the inaction of the Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks and its impacts, while Abitibi workers are prevented from earning a living.
Questioned by the member for Bonaventure in the National Assembly, Minister Laurent Lessard continues to close his eyes to the reality of workers and claims that all is well in the industry. “After job losses in Estrie, Shawinigan, Saguenay – Lac-Saint-Jean and Baie-Comeau, three Tembec factories in Abitibi are now going to interrupt their operations due to lack of supply. In La Sarre, Senneterre and Béarn, hundreds of workers are at risk of spending the holidays unemployed, while the minister takes pleasure in the inaction, ”declared Sylvain Roy.
Representatives of the affected communities revolted. The mayors of Senneterre and La Sarre, the prefect of the MRC de Témiscamingue and the workers&#39; unions have all denounced the minister&#39;s inaction.
“The people of the region, who are on the ground, are unanimous: there is wood. The Minister of Forests must make these volumes available to keep the factories open and thus avoid putting hundreds of workers out of work, ”added François Gendron.
