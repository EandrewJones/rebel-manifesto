Quebec - The Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, announces that the Council of Ministers has adopted the decree authorizing the holding of two by-elections, in the ridings of Viau and Outremont, on December 9th.
Ms. Marois also confirms that the Parti Québécois will not present a candidate in the constituency of Outremont in order to allow the leader of the Liberal Party, Philippe Couillard, to enter the National Assembly.
Remember that the holding of by-elections is made necessary in these ridings because of the departure of deputies Raymond Bachand, in Outremont, and Emmanuel Dubourg, in Viau.
