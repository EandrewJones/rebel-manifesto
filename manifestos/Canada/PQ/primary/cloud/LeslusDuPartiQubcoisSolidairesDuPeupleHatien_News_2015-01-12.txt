Quebec - The MNA for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, the MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesperson for international relations, Carole Poirier, as well as the MNA for Bourget and spokesperson for international relations immigration, Maka Kotto, express, on behalf of their fellow members of the Parti Québécois, their solidarity with the Haitian people, while we commemorate the earthquake of January 12, 2010.
“Today, all our thoughts are with the Haitians, who continue to work for the complete reconstruction of their country. Five years ago, hundreds of thousands of lives were lost or turned upside down. We remember those who disappeared, just as we express our solidarity with the survivors, ”said Stéphane Bédard.
“This is not the first time that these people have been called upon to rise up following a tragedy. In all resilience, each time, he looks to the future with determination and courage. January 12, 2010 cannot be forgotten; it will remain forever etched in our memories. Today, great challenges remain. Quebec and international engagement in Haiti must continue and reconstruction must be supported as much as possible, ”continued Carole Poirier.
The deputies ask the Couillard government to reiterate in Ottawa the importance of maintaining and increasing humanitarian aid in Haiti. While the federal government lifted the moratorium on removals last December, the Quebec government must do everything to support Haitian refugees in their dealings with Immigration Canada.
“Our Haitian compatriots, those who have chosen Quebec as a land of welcome, can count on the support of Quebecers. On this day of commemoration, we are with them; in addition to reaffirming our unfailing friendship to them, we assure them of our fraternal solidarity, ”concluded Maka Kotto.
