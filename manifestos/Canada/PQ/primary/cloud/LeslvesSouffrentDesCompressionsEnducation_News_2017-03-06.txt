Quebec - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of education, research, school perseverance and literacy, Alexandre Cloutier, is sorry that the cuts in education, imposed since the beginning of the Liberal mandate, continue to make the victims. In 2015-2016, the Ministry of Education identified 207,016 students with disabilities or with social maladjustments or learning difficulties (EHDAA) in public and private schools, compared to 191,747 in 2013-2014.
“The ministry&#39;s data is alarming. In 2 years, in Quebec, the number of students in difficulty has increased by 15,000; that&#39;s an increase of over 9%. But, as needs increase, the government keeps cutting. Naturally, it is first and foremost the students who suffer from it, ”said Alexandre Cloutier.
“Since the Liberals came to power, hundreds of educational professional positions have been cut in our schools. These psychologists, psychoeducators, speech therapists, remedial teachers, special education technicians - and so on - came to the aid of students in difficulty. What does the government intend to do? One thing is certain, for the past two years, rather than cutting back, getting entangled in a debate on structures and playing the musical chair with the ministers of education, he would have done better to focus on the success of our students. &quot;, he added.
Guaranteed threshold of direct services to students
“More than ever, the Parti Québécois proposal to set up a guaranteed threshold for direct services to students attending schools in Quebec is becoming relevant. Services for exceptional students should no longer bear the brunt of government budgetary decisions from year to year. The Ministry of Education establishes a minimum number of teachers per student; it should be the same for professionals who work with young people in difficulty, ”concluded the spokesperson.
