Quebec - Here is the letter that the Premier of Quebec, Ms. Pauline Marois, sent to Mr. Dalton McGuinty who yesterday announced his resignation as Premier of Ontario.
&quot;Mr. Dalton McGuinty
Premier of Ontario
Mr. Prime Minister,
It is with regret that I learned of your resignation as Premier after several years of service to Ontario.
As Premier of Ontario, you have always put forward the interests of your fellow citizens to whom you leave a considerable legacy. I would like to salute the vigor with which you defended the place of French in public affairs.
During your tenure, Ontario and Quebec have been able to maintain lasting ties, in addition to maintaining a high level of cooperation in several sectors of activity.
I wish to convey to you, on behalf of the Government of Quebec and on my behalf, my best wishes for the future.
Please accept, Mr. Prime Minister, the expression of my best feelings.
Original signed
PAULINE MAROIS &quot;
