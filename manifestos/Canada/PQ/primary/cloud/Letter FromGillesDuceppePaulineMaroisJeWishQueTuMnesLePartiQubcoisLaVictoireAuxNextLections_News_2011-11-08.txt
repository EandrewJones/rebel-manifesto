You will find below the letter that Gilles Duceppe sent today to Pauline Marois.
“Montreal, November 8, 2011
“Dear Pauline,
“Thank you once again for the invitation you gave me to join the Parti Québécois. This invitation having taken a public turn, I feel the obligation to remove any ambiguity.
“As I told you in private, I do not rule out joining you and the Parti Québécois in the future, but I do not feel ready, currently, to return to active political life.
“This does not mean, as some have said, that I am standing in“ reserve of the republic ”. I have no intention of taking anyone&#39;s place. I do not endorse or encourage any challenge to your leadership.
“On the contrary, as I have said many times in private and in public, I hope you will lead the Parti Québécois to victory in the next election.
“No one is better prepared than you. You have all the legitimacy, the experience and the determination to make it happen. Over the past few months, you have shown exceptional courage, a fundamental quality for anyone who aspires to lead Quebec and lead it to its full political freedom.
“Through this letter, I reiterate a message addressed to all sovereignists: let Pauline Marois and the Parti Québécois work. Let’s stop dividing ourselves. It is only in this way that we will be able to convince Quebeckers to trust us.
&quot; In all friendship,
&quot;Gilles Duceppe
&quot;P.-S. - I would ask you to make this letter public by the usual means. &quot;
