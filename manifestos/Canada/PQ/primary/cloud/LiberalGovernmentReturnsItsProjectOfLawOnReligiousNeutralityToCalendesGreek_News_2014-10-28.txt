Québec, October 28, 2014 - Agnès Maltais, the member for Taschereau, parliamentary leader and official opposition spokesperson for the Charter of Secularism, deplores the abandonment of another electoral promise by the Liberal government: the one concerning the tabling of a bill on religious neutrality and the fight against religious fundamentalism. “The government is dragging its feet on this issue when the Prime Minister promised to act quickly. Today, the Minister of Justice, Stéphanie Vallée, postponed the tabling of the bill until Greek calendars. The truth is the Liberals are trying to buy time. Unfortunately, the news has caught up with them. The government must act without delay and table a bill to fight fundamentalism, ”insisted Agnès Maltais. The member for Taschereau also indicates that the government obviously does not intend to set up an organization to measure religious fundamentalism and fight against this phenomenon in our society. “This idea was promoted by the former Member of Parliament for La Pinière, Fatima Houda-Pepin, the very one who was kicked out of the Liberal caucus by the Prime Minister. Are we to understand that the creation of this organization was removed from the Liberal radar at the same time as the former member for La Pinière? », Concluded Agnès Maltais.
