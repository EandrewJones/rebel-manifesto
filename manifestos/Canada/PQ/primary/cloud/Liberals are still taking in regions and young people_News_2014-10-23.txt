Québec, October 23, 2014 - The member for Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, denounces the Liberal attacks on the youth centers -employment (CJE).
“Once again, the Liberal government is attacking the Quebec model and sacrificing young people in Quebec. It is a real disorganization of the services which is announced. Since their creation in 1995 by the Parti Québécois, the CJEs have developed expertise focused on youth in all regions of Quebec. It is now Emploi-Québec which will choose the clientele to refer to them. The strength of CJEs lies in their flexibility and accessibility, which allows them to help a large number of young people struggling with literacy, addiction and bullying, or who would be tempted to drop out, ”said Dave Turcotte.
