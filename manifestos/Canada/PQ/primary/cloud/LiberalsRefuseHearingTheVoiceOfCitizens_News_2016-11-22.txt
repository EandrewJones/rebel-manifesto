As the end of this parliamentary session approaches and after more than 30 months of Liberal governance, the House leader of the official opposition, Pascal Bérubé, denounces the Liberal government&#39;s repeated refusals to hear the voices of citizens who use the petitions to advance ideas.
“Out of some 400 petitions tabled in the National Assembly at the request of citizens since April 2014, the Liberals have only consented once to the members of a parliamentary committee to follow up on a petition and give a mandate of initiative in connection with it. On more than 60 occasions, MPs have met in working session and the Liberals have used their majority to defeat motions calling for hearings to be held. The acceptance rate of petitions is therefore 1.6% ”, explained Pascal Bérubé.
“In 2009, all the parties wanted, in a non-partisan way, to reform our parliamentary rules by pursuing, in particular, the objective of bringing the National Assembly closer to the citizens. To achieve this, we have put in place tools to enhance the right to petition. However, if the government constantly uses its majority to block citizens&#39; initiatives, the goal will never be achieved, ”also denounced the parliamentary leader.
“After having repeated over and over again that citizens have their say more than once every four years, it is high time for the Liberal government that actions follow commitments: it must accept and take into account the tools and processes that have been made available to elected officials to bring the voice of citizens, ”concluded Pascal Bérubé.
