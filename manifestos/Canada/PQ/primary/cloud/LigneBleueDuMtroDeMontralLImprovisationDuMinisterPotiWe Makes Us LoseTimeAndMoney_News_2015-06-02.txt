Quebec - In the wake of the unveiling of the preliminary comparative study of surface transport modes, carried out by the Agence métropolitaine de transport (AMT) at the request of the Minister of Transport, Robert Poëti, the MNA for Vachon and spokesperson of the official opposition in the field of transport, Martine Ouellet, and the member for Rosemont and spokesperson for the Metropolis, Jean-François Lisée, denounce the improvisation of the minister, who continues to delay the extension project to the east of the blue line of the Montreal metro.
“Last January, without warning or consulting anyone, Robert Poëti decided that the AMT should study the option of a surface train for the extension of the blue line to the east of Montreal, even if there was a consensus that the project takes the form of a traditional metro. Ignoring the expenses thus incurred and the delays that his decision would entail, he changed the mandate of the project office, ”recalled Martine Ouellet.
However, the conclusion of the study, made public by the AMT today, is not surprising. “Surface mode could result in a 45% to 60% reduction in ridership generated by a conventional metro, and an increase of up to three times in travel time. It was obvious; why did the minister ask the AMT to look into the matter? We have wasted precious time, ”continued the MP.
For his part, Jean-François Lisée thinks of some 80,000 people who take this route every day and who have been impatiently awaiting the extension of the blue line of the metro for a long time. “The procrastination, hesitation and improvisation of Robert Poëti did nothing to advance the case, quite the contrary. Now he must go into action mode and commit to continuing the project in the form of a traditional metro; this is what citizens expect from him, ”he concluded.
