Quebec - The members of the Parti Québécois de Longueuil, Martine Ouellet (Vachon), Bernard Drainville (Marie-Victorin) and Diane Lamarre (Taillon), ask that the project to extend the yellow line of the Montreal metro be resumed, in parallel with the extension of the blue line.
“It is deplorable that the project to extend the yellow line of the Montreal metro has been stopped and that no timetable has been set, despite all the analyzes and studies undertaken in the past. This is a very important issue for the people of Longueuil and the South Shore, given all the congestion there is on the bridges, ”said Martine Ouellet.
“The citizens of Longueuil and the South Shore are experiencing immense stress; they are always afraid of being late for work, not to mention the hours they waste on bridges are hours they could spend with their families. It is also important to consider the increased GHG emissions and smog caused by needlessly stranded cars. Unfortunately, until now, the Minister of Transport, Jacques Daoust, has only succeeded in showing that he is not taking the situation seriously, ”added Bernard Drainville.
“When the Parti Québécois formed the government, there were projects linked to several metro lines. Can the minister send a clear signal that the yellow line will not be abandoned to the detriment of the blue line? The projects can very well be carried out in parallel. The residents of the South Shore have been very patient. The extension of the yellow metro line is also synonymous with reducing GHGs, an important issue for everyone, ”concluded Diane Lamarre.
