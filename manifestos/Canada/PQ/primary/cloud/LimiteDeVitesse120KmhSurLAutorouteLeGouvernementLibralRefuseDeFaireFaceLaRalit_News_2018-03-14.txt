Québec, March 14, 2018 - “Today, as part of the study of Bill 165, An Act to amend the Highway Safety Code and other provisions, the Parti Québécois proposed to the Minister of Transport, André Fortin, to conduct a pilot project aimed at setting the speed limit at 120 km / h on Quebec highways. Unfortunately, the minister rejected the idea out of hand, preferring to continue with hypocrisy, ”declared Martin Ouellet, official opposition spokesperson for transport, and André Villeneuve, MP for Berthier.
IN SHORT
“It is common knowledge that it is possible to drive at 115 or even 120 km / h on the highway without being worried by the police, even if the official limit is set at 100. The Parti Québécois considers that it It is high time to put an end to this hypocrisy, to seriously study the possibility of setting the speed limit at 120 km / h on Quebec highways, and to enforce it, ”said Martin Ouellet.
“The objective is first and foremost one of public safety: the rules must be clear for everyone and applied uniformly. In other words, no more sudden slowdowns for fear of meeting a police officer who may be less tolerant! The pilot project should also include the possibility of reducing the maximum speed when the weather conditions are difficult, as is already provided for in the Highway Safety Code ”, for his part explained André Villeneuve, who participates in the parliamentary committee on Bill 165.
“Yesterday, the Minister of Transport and his team confessed that photo radars are not calibrated to issue tickets according to the current limit of 100 km / h. So what is the speed really tolerated by the police? It&#39;s a mystery. We have not been able to get a response. This is completely absurd, and it shows that the law absolutely must be adjusted to the reality on the ground. We do not understand why the Liberal government is hiding its head in the sand like this. A Parti Québécois government would put an end to this hypocrisy, ”concluded Martin Ouellet.
