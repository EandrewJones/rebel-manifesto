Quebec - The member for Sainte-Marie-Saint-Jacques, Mr. Daniel Breton, participated yesterday in a meeting between the spokespersons of the UTILE cooperative, accompanied by different groups and representatives gathered around the Caisse d&#39;économie solidaire, as well as than the President of the Treasury Board, Mr. Stéphane Bédard. The director of the cabinet of the minister responsible for the Metropolis, Mr. Jean-François Lisée, was also present.
During this meeting, the participants wanted to continue their work so that the Ilot Voyageur file had a positive outcome as quickly as possible. Equally, it was agreed that efforts must also be made to improve the supply of student housing in the Latin Quarter and the revitalization of this important sector of Montreal.
“Having worked on this file from the start, I am very satisfied with Minister Bédard&#39;s listening and openness to the lack of affordable student housing that the dynamic UTILE team is trying to unravel. In addition, together we must find the best economic and social solution for the Voyageur island. The City of Montreal plays a central role in this file. It will have to get involved concretely to transform this sad legacy of the Liberal government into an object of pride worthy of a metropolis in full renaissance, ”declared Mr. Breton.
