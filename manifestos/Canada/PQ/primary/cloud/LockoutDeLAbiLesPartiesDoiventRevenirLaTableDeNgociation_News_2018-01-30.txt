Québec, January 30, 2018 - The leader of the official opposition, Jean-François Lisée, and the labor spokesperson, Guy Leclair, call on the union and management parties of the Bécancour Smelter (ABI) to return at the bargaining table. In order for an agreement to be reached, the Liberal government must put everything on the table and also demand that discussions be resumed.
IN SHORT
“Since the start of the lockout two weeks ago, 1,030 unionized workers have been unemployed and 80 workers from a subcontracting company have been sacked. ABI is the largest employer in the region. It is high time that Minister Vien came out of her silence and set the record straight for the workers. What does the Liberal government plan to do to encourage both parties to return to the negotiating table? The Minister must act! », Declared Guy Leclair.
“The nature of the conflict is forcing the Liberal government to act, but once again it finds itself behind the news. I call on the minister to act quickly; the region must not be held hostage by this conflict. Thousands of families are affected. The company also benefits from commercial agreements and preferential rates from Hydro-Québec. The taxpayers&#39; public money is at stake, which makes the resumption of negotiations all the more urgent, ”added Jean-François Lisée.
“Despite the media outings of the CAQ MP for Nicolet-Bécancour, Donald Martel, we can clearly see that the Coalition Avenir Québec is not in a position to make the workers&#39; voice heard in this conflict. It is not surprising that this one continues; Mr. Martel has not yet deigned to meet the workers or the management of the company! “, Concluded the spokesperson in labor matters.
