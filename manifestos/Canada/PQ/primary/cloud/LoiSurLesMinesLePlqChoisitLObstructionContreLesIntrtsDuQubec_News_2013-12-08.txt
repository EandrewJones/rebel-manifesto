Quebec— The Leader of the government and Member of Parliament for Chicoutimi, Mr. Stéphane Bédard, wanted to react to the exit of the Liberal Party of Quebec (PLQ) earlier today: “The demands formulated by the PLQ are a veritable farce to delay the adoption of a long-awaited bill as quickly as possible. They deliberately use subterfuge to hide the reality: the PLQ is against the modernization of the rules that legislate the industry and does not want to know anything about the transformation in Quebec. Nothing has changed since the Charest era ”.
The government of Quebec asked last Saturday that the National Assembly of Quebec sit exceptionally on Monday, December 9, 2013 to pass Bill 70 (An Act to amend the Mining Act) through a legislative procedure. exception. The PLQ today asked to revoke the special convocation and to spread the study of Bill 70 over several days: “Quebeckers have been waiting for a mining reform for years. Philippe Couillard&#39;s by-election tomorrow is no reason to disappoint Quebecers twice! », Decided Mr. Bédard.
It should be remembered that in recent weeks, after trying to have its mining bill adopted, the government reached an agreement with the Coalition d&#39;avenir Québec for the adoption of a balanced bill in favor of the citizens, municipalities, mining companies and environmental groups. &quot;Obviously, the only and last obstacle to a reform of the mining regime in Quebec is the PLQ&quot;, concluded the member for Chicoutimi
