Montreal - The Parti Québécois candidate in the riding of Gouin, Louise Mailloux, wishes to return to some of the comments she made before she was a candidate for the Parti Québécois.
“Over the past few days, a lot has been said around the words I have spoken in the debate on reasonable accommodation. Regarding my statements on certain religious practices, I want to say that I never wanted to offend or hurt anyone. If this was the case, I sincerely apologize for it, ”said Louise Mailloux.
&quot;I am an activist of secularism and, if I decided to take the leap into politics, it is above all to defend the draft charter of values, which aims to ensure equality between women and men as well as the religious neutrality of the State, and to set guidelines for religious accommodation, with respect for all religions, ”she concluded.
The candidate will not comment further on this matter.
