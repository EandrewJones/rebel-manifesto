Quebec - Following the arrest in Montreal of young people suspected of wanting to join the ranks of the terrorist organization Islamic State, the Member of Parliament for Taschereau and official opposition spokesperson for secularism, Agnès Maltais, urges the Minister of Justice to table, by the end of this parliamentary session, a bill to fight against the phenomena of religious fundamentalism and radicalization.
“The demonstration is made: whatever one thinks about it, even in Quebec, the phenomenon of religious fundamentalism is very real, and we must tackle it. The Minister of Justice made a commitment, over a year ago, to table a bill quickly, but the deadline is constantly being pushed back. Today, moreover, she has remained strangely silent, refusing to answer questions, which suggests that the tabling of a bill on secularism, religious neutrality and reasonable accommodation will be postponed once again. Moreover, if we take into account the fact that it was the Minister of Public Security who rose to answer my questions, can this be seen as a sign that the government intends to deal with the issue from the perspective of coercion, instead of focusing on prevention? », Asked Agnès Maltais.
The Member recalls that in February, the Parti Québécois tabled Bill 395, Law on the Observer of Religious Fundamentalism, proposing the creation of an observer position, intended to understand religious fundamentalism. , to document it and prevent it. “Right now, concerned parents have no choice but to contact the RCMP. This is insane. They should be able to count on upstream resources. An observer of fundamentalism could, in fact, suggest courses of action and solutions to equip families, ”she concluded.
