Quebec– Mathieu Traversy, Member of Parliament for Terrebonne and Official Opposition Critic for the Fight Against Bullying, Member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and Critic for Elementary and Secondary Education and Perseverance school, Nicole Léger, as well as the member for Lac-Saint-Jean and justice critic, Alexandre Cloutier, denounce the inconsistency of the Liberal government, which is holding a high mass to tackle bullying and violence in schools, while at the same time, he suggests that schools cut the envelope provided for this purpose.
It should be remembered that during the summer, the office of the Minister of Education, Yves Bolduc, gave the school boards a list comprising 32 suggestions for possible cuts in direct services to students. Unfortunately, this morning, we have noticed that some school boards will follow the advice of the minister&#39;s office and cut the budgets allocated to the measure Preventing and combating bullying and violence in schools.
“How could the Liberal government suggest cutting the budgets dedicated to the fight against bullying in schools, when it is supposed to be a priority for the Prime Minister and the Minister of Families? At this very moment, they are both participating in a forum on this topic; Where is the consistency? Asked MP Mathieu Traversy.
Nicole Léger, for her part, insisted on the responsibility of Minister Yves Bolduc. “How much has been cut in the fight against bullying in Quebec schools? The Minister of Education is responsible for this sad situation, and it is his duty to quantify the extent of the damage. Quebeckers have the right to know, ”declared the member.
&quot;Will these cuts affect the application of the 2011-2016 government action plan to fight homophobia in Quebec schools?&quot; The situation is worrying. The Minister of Justice cannot sit idly by; she must intervene with her colleague, Minister of Education, ”said Alexandre Cloutier.
