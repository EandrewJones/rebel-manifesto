Quebec - In the presence of Bernard St-Jacques, community organizer at the Montreal Support Network for Individuals and Itinerants (RAPSIM), the Parti Québécois spokesperson for social services, youth protection and public health and prevention, Jean-François Lisée, formally asked the Minister for Youth Protection and Public Health, Lucie Charlebois, to use the new federal sums to restore funding to groups fighting against homelessness .
“Under pressure from groups, Ottawa has just added 10 million per year to the HPS, the Homelessness Partnering Strategy. The opportunity is too good to pass up. The Minister must ensure that the sum is used to repair the damage caused by the formula that the Harper government has imposed on Quebec: 22 organizations have seen their funding completely cut, ”pleaded the Member for Rosemont.
Unfortunately, when questioned during the study of her appropriations, Minister Charlebois refused to commit to using these sums without hindrance. On the contrary, she defended tooth and nail the “housing first” strategy imposed by the Harper government, without acknowledging the negative effects on the multifaceted efforts offered by the community network, which are however widely documented.
“The reorientation of the HPS has caused a significant setback in the field: we have seen a reduction in the opening hours of certain organizations, the elimination of worker positions in others, a forced rationing of services, and I on the way, ”continued Jean-François Lisée.
Finally, the member recalled that the members of the Parti Québécois de Montréal caucus sent the Minister a letter also requesting a renegotiation of the 2014-2019 HPS agreement to provide for more flexibility, as demanded by the stakeholders of the middle.
