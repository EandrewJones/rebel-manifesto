Quebec - The proof is now clear and unequivocal: the government wants to appoint itself the person who will investigate the Liberal Party. This is the only conclusion that can be reached, believes the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in the area of public security, Pascal Bérubé. The government rejected the motion it presented today in the House on this subject.
“We know that the Liberal Party is currently under investigation by UPAC. However, the mandate of the commissioner at the head of UPAC, whose mission is to ensure the coordination of actions to prevent and fight corruption in contractual matters in the public sector, has expired, and the commissioner asks the political party on which he is investigating to reappoint him in office. This is insane, it does not inspire confidence at all, and it absolutely has to change! », Insisted the spokesperson.
The Parti Québécois is of the opinion that the post of commissioner for the fight against corruption should be occupied by a person who has obtained the favor of two-thirds of the elected officials sitting in the National Assembly. “This is how in Quebec, we appoint the Auditor General and the Chief Electoral Officer. I do not see how or why we could take less precautions to appoint a person as important as the commissioner for the fight against corruption ”, continued Pascal Bérubé.
The motion rejected by the Liberal MPs reads as follows:
“That the National Assembly ask the government that the appointment of the anti-corruption commissioner be approved by two-thirds of its members. &quot;
