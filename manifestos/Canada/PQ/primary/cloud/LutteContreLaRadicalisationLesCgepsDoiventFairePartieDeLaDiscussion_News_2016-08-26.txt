The member for Taschereau and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on secularism, Agnès Maltais, as well as the member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesperson for education, Alexandre Cloutier, denounce the fact that the Fédération des cégeps has been excluded from the upcoming international conference on radicalization, even though the government claims to actively fight against this scourge.
“The Center for the Prevention of Radicalization Leading to Violence has just published a comprehensive report showing that the school environment in general, and the Collège de Maisonneuve in particular, is proving to be fertile ground for radicalization. As proof, no less than thirty young Quebecers, including several students from the Collège de Maisonneuve, have been indoctrinated in order to join the jihad in Syria. And the government wouldn&#39;t even invite CEGEPs to a conference aimed at countering radicalization? This is insane, ”said Agnès Maltais.
“It is a cry of alarm that the Fédération des cégeps launched to the government this morning. People on the ground feel the need to come out publicly to emphasize the Liberal government&#39;s laxity when it comes to preventing radicalization in education. The government must correct the situation. Quebec must, like all Western countries, do everything in its power to curb the radicalization of its young people, ”added Alexandre Cloutier.
“The school environment is the perfect place to teach secularism, an aspect of social life that has characterized Quebec since the Quiet Revolution. Secularism is a value that can be taught and learned, and those involved in the education network are certainly among the best placed to make our young people aware of and interested in the issue. They are certainly part of the solution in the fight against radicalization and religious fundamentalism, and must absolutely be invited to the collective reflection that will be held on the subject, ”concluded the Member for Taschereau.
