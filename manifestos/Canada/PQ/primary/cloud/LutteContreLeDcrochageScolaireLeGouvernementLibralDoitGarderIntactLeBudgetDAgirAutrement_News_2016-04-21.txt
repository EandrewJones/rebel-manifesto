Quebec - The Parti Québécois denounces the decision of the Liberal government to cut 25% of the budget of the Intervention Strategy Agir Otherwise, the main government measure to fight against dropping out of school. The member for Pointe-aux-Trembles, Nicole Léger, questioned him this morning on this subject during the question period.
“This is another brick that falls on education and the future of our young people. How can the government, on the one hand, say that it wants to fight dropping out, while, on the other, it is cutting back on the main school perseverance program? It must restore the sums of Agir Otherwise, ”said Nicole Léger.
This program, created by the Parti Québécois government, is aimed specifically at young people most likely to drop out, in the most disadvantaged areas. It allows the establishment of specialized classes as well as the organization of extracurricular and sports activities. In short, Agir Otherwise&#39;s objectives are to support young people at risk and help them stay in school.
“During the study of the appropriations, we showed that the amounts announced in education are financed from new cuts. The Liberal government must understand that cutting school perseverance programs is the worst thing it can do for the future of Quebec, ”concluded the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles.
