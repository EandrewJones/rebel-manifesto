Quebec– Sylvain Gaudreault, the member for Jonquière and Parti Québécois spokesperson for the environment and the fight against climate change, is pleased to have been invited by the Canadian section of the Climate Reality Project to its next training of ambassadors of the climate, to be held in Denver, Colorado, March 2-4, 2017.
The Climate Reality Project training program is an initiative of former Vice President of the United States, Al Gore. Hundreds of participants from around the world will benefit from Mr. Gore&#39;s lessons on climate change. These trainings aim to provide ambassadors with tools to enable them to educate them about the climate crisis and to become effective agents of change.
“I am very proud to have been invited to this prestigious event. The Parti Québécois takes it as a sign of encouragement for its firm determination to fight effectively for the reduction of greenhouse gases and against climate change, ”said the MP.
“Our leader was clear: voting blue is voting green! In this year of congress for the Parti Québécois, at the end of which the members will adopt a new program, I fully intend to use my achievements so that our political formation continues to be fully engaged in the fight against climate change, ”continued the spokesperson for the official opposition.
Sylvain Gaudreault specified that from an environmental point of view, among the major political parties in Quebec, it is the Parti Québécois which already has the most concrete, the most realistic and the most feasible plan. “I intend to draw inspiration from the training offered by the Climate Reality Project in order to improve the Parti Québécois&#39; already ambitious plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I also wish to learn from Al Gore&#39;s experience to involve the Quebec population more in the development and implementation of a concrete climate action plan ”, he concluded. .
