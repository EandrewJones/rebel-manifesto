Quebec - The Minister of Public Security and Minister responsible for the Outaouais region, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, announces the granting of a total sum of $ 116,200, from the sale following the seizures made by the various police services in Quebec and seizures obtained from the courts for the fight against the proceeds of crime, at the Avenue des jeunes and at the &quot;Entre-Nous&quot; community center:
&quot;Through their commitment and their targeted actions, the workers at the Avenue des jeunes and the&quot; Entre-Nous &quot;community center help prevent delinquency among young people and it is with pride that we support them concretely in their efforts. »Declared Mr. Bergeron.
Since 1999, a proportion of 25% of the net proceeds from the resale of goods obtained illegally and which have become the property of the State as a result of police operations has been given each year to community organizations in Quebec. This program provides financial assistance to community organizations that work with young people in particular to carry out a crime prevention project.
“The proceeds of crime must go to those who are its victims as well as to the organizations that support them or that do prevention with vulnerable clienteles. The mission of these two organizations is a fine example of an initiative that the Government of Quebec wishes to encourage, so that they can continue their essential work, ”the Minister concluded.
