Quebec - The member for Crémazie and official opposition spokesperson for seniors, Lisette Lapointe, strongly deplores the attitude of the Minister of Seniors, Marguerite Blais, who suggests that it is thanks to her that the National Ethics Committee on Aging will be maintained.
Faced with the government&#39;s stubborn refusal to maintain the Seniors Council, the Member for Crémazie proposed to the President of the Treasury Board, Michelle Courchesne, that the National Ethics Committee on Aging be maintained. This committee is made up of exceptional personalities, all volunteers. Minister Courchesne welcomed this proposal and an amendment to maintain the National Ethics Committee on Aging was therefore adopted yesterday morning in parliamentary committee.
“For weeks, we have been insisting, supported by the major associations of seniors in Quebec, in favor of the survival of the Council of Seniors. During all this time, Minister Blais never intervened and wanted to hear this vibrant plea. Minister Blais should have a little honor and recognize that the decision to maintain, at a minimum, the National Ethics Committee on Aging is not the result of her work, ”said Lisette Lapointe.
In addition, the Member for Crémazie would like to thank all the people, employees and volunteers, who, over the past few years, have devoted themselves and put their expertise and talent at the service of Quebec society for the well-being of seniors. .
