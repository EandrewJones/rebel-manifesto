Quebec - The member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition critic for elementary and secondary education and school perseverance, Nicole Léger, is disappointed with the words of the Prime Minister, who said today that &#39;he did not intend to replace Yves Bolduc at the head of the Ministry of Education, Leisure and Sport.
“The Prime Minister talks about a 2020-2025 vision for schools; this year he has obviously decided to ax student services. When we hear him praise the work of his Minister of Education, we have the impression that he is in a parallel universe. If there is one thing that is unanimous in education today, it is that the minister is not up to the task. In fact, there is only one person in Quebec who has not yet understood that Yves Bolduc is out of place: Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, ”said Nicole Léger.
Minister Yves Bolduc added yesterday, mentioning that the increase in the teacher-student ratio would have no impact, a statement going against what the entire education community supports; many studies looking at this ratio have shown that the number of students per class is a determining factor in the academic success of all children, especially students in difficulty.
“This exit of Yves Bolduc, to justify the increase in the ratio, is the last act of a tragicomedy which has only one character: the Minister of Education himself. This bad play has gone on long enough. For the sake of the children of Quebec and the entire education community, Yves Bolduc must leave, ”concluded Nicole Léger.
