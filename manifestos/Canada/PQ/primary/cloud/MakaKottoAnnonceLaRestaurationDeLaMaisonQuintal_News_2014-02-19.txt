Boucherville - The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, announces the allocation of financial assistance of $ 99,300 for the restoration of the Quintal house, in Boucherville, classified as a heritage building under the Cultural Heritage Act .
“Heritage properties deserve special attention, and the Government of Quebec recognizes the importance of seeing to their safeguard. I am grateful to the current owners of Quintal House, a residence of exceptional heritage value, for their commitment to the conservation of this place. Its sustainability can thus be ensured for the benefit of the people of the region, but also of all those interested in the architecture and history of Quebec, ”said Minister Kotto.
The Quintal house has been protected since 1976. It benefits from a protected area and is part of the heritage site cited in Vieux-Boucherville. This former farmhouse of the French Regime was built between 1727 and 1750, and modified in 1887 in the eclectic Victorian spirit. It is akin, in many ways, to the colonial mansions of the cotton plantations of the southern United States.
The restoration project, estimated at some $ 250,000, mainly targets the foundations of the house. The contribution of nearly $ 100,000 from the Ministry of Culture and Communications is part of the Quebec Cultural Heritage Fund. The owners of the house supplement the financing.
Additional information concerning the Quintal house as well as all the heritage elements registered in the Cultural Heritage Register are available on the website of the Quebec Cultural Heritage Directory (RPCQ), at www.patrimoine-culturel.gouv.qc.ca. This dissemination tool from the Ministry of Culture and Communications makes it possible to discover the richness and diversity of Quebec&#39;s cultural heritage by making it accessible to all. Part of the content of the RPCQ can now be found on the Government of Quebec&#39;s open data portal, at www.data.gouv.qc.ca.
