The slave trade, which lasted from the 16th century to the 19th century and which caused the deportation and sale of more than 25 million women, men and children, constitutes one of the greatest tragedies of humanity in this regard. which relates to scale and duration.
“Generations later, the level of resonance is still so high, and the memory of this episode of recent humanity has remained vivid throughout the African continent and throughout the world. These centuries of uprooting still have consequences for their development and their future in several African countries, ”said Maka Kotto.
“Forgetting often opens the doors to a perpetual restart. Injustice, atrocities, crimes against humanity and racism, among others, are evils that still plague our planet. As the late Nelson Mandela said, education is the most powerful weapon that can be used to change the world. Let us take advantage of this day of August 23 to measure all the possibilities ”, concluded the deputy.
