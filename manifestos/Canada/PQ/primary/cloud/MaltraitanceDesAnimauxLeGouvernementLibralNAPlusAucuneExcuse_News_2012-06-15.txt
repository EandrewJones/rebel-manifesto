Quebec– The member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata and official opposition critic for agriculture and food, André Simard, wishes to underline the concerted work done in parliamentary committee around Bill 51, An Act to amend the Animal Health Protection Act primarily concerned with animal safety and welfare. “We made ten amendments to this bill that we demanded from the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Now, the government no longer has any excuse not to move forward and vigorously curb pet mistreatment, ”said André Simard.
Law 51, which will be adopted this morning, now provides for hefty fines, compulsory licenses to keep 15 cats or dogs or more and new regulatory powers which will allow, among other things, the Minister to better supervise breeding, sale and the care of pets. “It takes political courage, determination and commitment to really take action. This is what we want and what the people of Quebec want from Minister Corbeil, ”said the member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata.
“I am a veterinarian by training. This issue has been close to my heart for a long time. I had to question the Minister at the Salon Bleu in November 2011 for the latter to finally table a bill promised and awaited for more than two years. Then, it took six months for the government to call the bill in parliamentary committee. We hope that it will act more quickly in the adoption of the regulation which must follow the adoption of the law, ”added André Simard.
&quot;It is imperative that the government take action in the coming weeks and show more vigor than it has done so far in order to counter the too many cases of animal abuse and in order to so that puppy mills disappear ”, concluded the deputy.
