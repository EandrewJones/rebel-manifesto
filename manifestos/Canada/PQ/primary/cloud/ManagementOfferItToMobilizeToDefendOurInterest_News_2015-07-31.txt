Quebec - The member for Berthier and official opposition critic for agriculture, André Villeneuve, calls on the Quebec Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, and the federal parties to come out clearly in the defense of Quebec farmers as part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations.
In an article published today in the Globe and Mail, we learn that the abandonment of the supply management system has been contemplated by the Harper government for weeks. Indeed, farmers who would suffer the consequences of signing the Trans-Pacific Partnership would receive a set of compensation, which was assessed last month in Ottawa.
“When two ministers from the Harper government, in this case Denis Lebel and Maxime Bernier, say that they will defend supply management in the context of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, but that in secret, they are preparing the abandonment, we can only conclude that they are laughing in our face! », Denounced André Villeneuve.
“For weeks, the Parti Québécois and the Bloc Québécois have been echoing the concerns of farmers. Where is Minister Paradis? Premier Couillard? Thomas Mulcair and Justin Trudeau? Here is further proof of the importance of Quebec independence. More than ever, we must be present at international negotiation tables if we really want to defend the interests of Quebecers, ”concluded the Member for Berthier.
