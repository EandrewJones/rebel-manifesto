Quebec - The member for Berthier and official opposition critic for agriculture, André Villeneuve, is sorry that Minister Pierre Paradis does not go himself to meet the next generation of farmers in Quebec. The minister entrusted this mandate to the former president of the Commission on the future of agriculture and agri-food in Quebec, Jean Pronovost. However, by refusing to deal with this issue personally, it is relieving itself of its responsibilities.
“The minister refuses to do the job. Having met many representatives of the agricultural community myself over the past year, I have noticed that Pierre Paradis carefully avoids doing the same. The mandate entrusted to Jean Pronovost is not a broad consultation or a commission of inquiry; we only ask him to go and listen to what the next generation has to say. What is preventing the minister from meeting these people himself? Asked André Villeneuve.
Remember that the bill on workforce control, adopted last December, was to put a stop to service contracts. Unfortunately, the cases are multiplying: just think of the contracts awarded to André Dicaire at the Ministry of the Executive Council, or to François Garneau, who must find where to make cuts at the Ministry of Culture and Communications. Added to this is today&#39;s announcement: Pierre Paradis will call on Jean Pronovost to do his work as Minister in his place. &quot;While the minister will remain in his office, how much will the mandate he entrusted to Jean Pronovost cost Quebeckers?&quot; », Concluded André Villeneuve.
