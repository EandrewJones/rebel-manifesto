Quebec– Martine Ouellet, Member of Parliament for Vachon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of transport, deplores the government&#39;s refusal to follow up on the mandate of the Committee on Public Administration (CAP) to follow up on the actions undertaken by the Minister with a view to consolidating governance at the Ministère des Transports (MTQ).
&quot;One can only deplore the fact that the Liberal government did not want to follow up on the CAP recommendation. But this liberal decision comes as no surprise, as the minister has already publicly stated that he has no intention of cleaning up the MTQ, despite all the ethical and governance setbacks that have embarrassed the ministry for years. Minister Lessard demonstrates, once again, that he does not take good governance seriously, unless he tells us that he is too bogged down in managing his personal ethical shortcomings to deal with properly from his ministry, ”the MP lamented.
“If the government refuses to follow up on the actions it has taken to improve the management of the MTQ, it is quite simply because nothing has been done since 2014. However, the stakes are high! The MTQ is the largest client in Quebec; mismanagement within it is therefore losing hundreds of millions of dollars to Quebecers. I would also add that if Minister Lessard believes that there are no ethical issues around him, he really lives on another planet, ”continued the spokesperson.
It should be remembered that recommendation 8.2 of the CAP report - adopted unanimously by the members of the committee, and therefore by some Liberal MPs - suggested mandating a committee to follow up on the actions put in place to improve the governance of the MTQ. “The government refused to table our motion asking the National Assembly to mandate the Committee on Transportation and the Environment in this regard; that says it all, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
