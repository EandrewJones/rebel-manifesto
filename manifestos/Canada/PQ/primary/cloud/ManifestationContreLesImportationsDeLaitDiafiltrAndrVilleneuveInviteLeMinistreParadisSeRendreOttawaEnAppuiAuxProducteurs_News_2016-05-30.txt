Quebec - The Parti Québécois agriculture and food spokesperson, André Villeneuve, was present this morning to support the dairy producers who left by tractor for Ottawa to demonstrate against imports of diafiltered milk. Accompanied by his colleagues François Gendron, Agnès Maltais and Harold LeBel, he sent out a strong message in favor of producers.
“The federal minister is aware of the problem and knows the solutions, but he refuses to implement them. The National Assembly unanimously spoke in support of producers, and I will be in Ottawa on Thursday to express this support. I invite the Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, to join me in sending a strong message to the federal government. I also invite the CAQ and Québec solidaire to be present, in the field, with the producers, ”declared André Villeneuve.
Imports of diafiltered milk, contrary to the spirit of federal regulations, are harmful to our farmers, who face unfair competition. “Diafiltered milk from the United States causes losses for Quebec farms of around one hundred million dollars annually. For a dairy farm, that can represent a shortfall of more than $ 20,000 per year. These are human tragedies that are looming on the horizon, if nothing is done. The federal government need only apply its regulations consistently, and the problem will be resolved, ”concluded André Villeneuve.
