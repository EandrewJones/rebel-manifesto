Quebec - Following the tabling of government offers for the renewal of public service collective agreements, the member for Sanguinet and official opposition spokesperson for the Treasury Board, Alain Therrien, invites the Liberal government and his President of the Treasury Board, Martin Coiteux, to negotiate in good faith with union representatives.
“As the negotiation process begins, we invite the President of the Conseil du trésor to put his ego aside and negotiate with respect for workers and the ability of Quebecers to pay. Our public service, as well as health and education workers, are committed people who are committed to the well-being of the population. We have every interest, socially, in maintaining this quality and recruiting the best possible candidates to work within it, because we must preserve the expertise there. This constant concern should remain in the mind of the Liberal government as negotiations begin, ”declared Alain Therrien.
Will we experience the return of the old Liberal recipe?
The deputy also expresses his fear of seeing the return of the good old liberal method, made up of confrontations and divisions. “We remember the many crises the Liberal government has created since 2003, as well as the anger and concern it has sown. No one in Quebec wants this general state of mind to return. The Liberal government must therefore negotiate in good faith, ”concluded Alain Therrien.
