Quebec - Martine Ouellet, MP for Vachon and official opposition spokesperson for transportation, transportation electrification and maritime strategy, submitted a brief to the public hearings of the Commission des transports du Québec (CTQ) concerning the requests of the company Orléans Express, which wishes to modify its intercity bus transport services.
In the brief submitted by Martine Ouellet, the members of the Parti Québécois ask the CTQ to form a working committee in order to bring together the various private and public stakeholders in interurban transport in Quebec.
“We could thus think about new solutions that could guarantee the maintenance of the bus service, already precarious in several regions, and the profitability of transport companies. Until the committee has tabled its report, Orléans Express must maintain its services to avoid a reduction in the supply of public transport, particularly in regions for which the bus remains the last affordable means of transport, ”he added. declared the member.
The reduction and disappearance of the services proposed by the applicant would have several direct consequences, such as a reduction in the mobility of the elderly and in accessibility to the Rimouski hospital, a limitation of the parcel delivery service, the loss of &#39;around forty jobs, reduced mobility to the towns of La Tuque, Thetford Mines and Louiseville, and could even threaten tourism development in the Gaspé. Moreover, this reduction in service would mainly affect students and seniors, especially those with low incomes.
“Considering the importance of the modifications requested by Orléans Express, the CTQ must mandate a working committee that will reflect on solutions better suited to the new realities of public transit in the region. Simply reducing service is not an option, ”said Martine Ouellet.
