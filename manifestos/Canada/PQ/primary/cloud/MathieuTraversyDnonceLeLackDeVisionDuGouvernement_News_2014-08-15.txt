Quebec City, August 15, 2014 - Mathieu Traversy, the member for Terrebonne and official opposition spokesperson for families, deplores the postponement of the creation of thousands of childcare spaces, which are highly anticipated by families. This shows, according to him, the Liberal Party&#39;s lack of vision with regard to the economy and support for families in Quebec.
“The Minister of Families, Francine Charbonneau, does not seem to realize that childcare services are an investment and not an expense, and that postponing the allocation of places hurts families in all regions. This decision will have significant impacts on work-family balance for thousands of Quebecers. The Liberal Party&#39;s lack of vision is very damaging to Quebec&#39;s economy, and once again it is families who bear the brunt, ”said Mathieu Traversy.
A lack of sense of priorities The deputy also denounces the minister&#39;s remarks, reported in the media this morning, to the effect that the previous government had not budgeted for the places it had announced. Mathieu Traversy recalls that on the contrary, in the two budgets tabled by the former Minister of Finance, Nicolas Marceau, the government of Pauline Marois had planned and registered the creation of 28,000 places.
“The Parti Québécois government made the creation of these places a priority. Minister Charbonneau has only one to blame if she cannot make the Prime Minister listen to reason and make it a priority for her government as well. Once again, the Liberal decisions prove to us that the only party which has a vision for the economy and which defends our families is the Parti Québécois, ”concluded the spokesperson.
