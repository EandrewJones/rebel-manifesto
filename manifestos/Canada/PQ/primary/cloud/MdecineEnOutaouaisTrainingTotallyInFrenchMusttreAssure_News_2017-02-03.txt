Quebec City, February 3, 2017– The announcement last fall of the establishment of a medical school in the Outaouais is a source of great hope and enthusiasm in the region, of course, but it must be ensured that the entire training is offered in French. This is the call made by Jean François Lisée, leader of the official opposition and spokesman for the Parti Québécois on the French language, and Stéphane Bergeron, MP for Verchères and head of the Outaouais region.
“In Quebec, it&#39;s non-negotiable: the common and official language is French. We are asking the government to be firm, to ensure that the right of students in the Outaouais to receive training entirely in French is respected, ”declared the leader of the official opposition.
“The arrival of a faculty of medicine in the Outaouais region must be an opportunity for the region and its population to see health disparities diminish. We must fight against the exodus of professionals and patients to Ontario, and not contribute directly or indirectly! Since the start of classes is not expected until 2020, McGill University has enough time to adapt; it also has all the necessary resources to offer 100% French education, from the first year, ”added Stéphane Bergeron.
In order to support McGill, the Parti Québécois proposes to involve the University of Quebec in Outaouais (UQO) in the process. “This would make it possible to develop expertise and, possibly, related training in the region, in addition to providing students with an environment favorable to their learning,” continued the Member for Verchères.
“It would be cruelly ironic, if not completely unacceptable, for students from the Outaouais to be able to take medical training in French in Ottawa, but not in Gatineau. The government must make a firm commitment in this regard, and confirm that it will promote UQO&#39;s collaboration, ”concluded Jean François Lisée.
