Quebec - Premier-designate Pauline Marois today met with incumbent Jean Charest to discuss the transition process underway. The discussion was cordial and took place in an atmosphere of frank collaboration.
“Mr. Charest assured me of his support and that of his team so that the transition goes smoothly. The only concern which animated us during this discussion was the good progress of the business of the State, affirmed the Prime Minister-designate. This meeting allows me to assure Quebeckers that the current government continues to oversee day-to-day business while my government prepares to assume its responsibilities. &quot;
The Premier-designate took the opportunity to pay tribute to Mr. Charest and his family who have dedicated 28 years of their lives to serving Quebecers.
“Over the past nine years, Jean Charest will have exercised the demanding function of Premier of Quebec, clearly testifying to the great strength and courage of this extraordinary politician. A tireless traveler, he was a passionate ambassador for Quebec on the international scene. He energetically defended Quebec&#39;s point of view in the fight against climate change, forged many links with member countries of La Francophonie and concluded beneficial agreements for Quebec with France, ”she said.
History will also remember from Mr. Charest that he was a great promoter of equality between women and men. “Concerned about giving an important place to women, he succeeded in setting up a joint Council of Ministers, which is no small feat considering the still present difficulty for women to get involved in politics. We must also salute Mr. Charest&#39;s decision to demand parity on the boards of directors of government corporations, ”concluded Pauline Marois, taking the opportunity to wish Mr. Charest as well as his wife, Michelle Dionne, and their children the best of luck for the future.
