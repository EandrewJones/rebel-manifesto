Quebec - The MP for Bonaventure and official opposition spokesperson for forests, Sylvain Roy, urges the Liberal government not to slash the budgets of the Office of the Chief Forester, cuts that would once again hit the regions of Quebec full force.
“After tackling university forest research budgets last week with the abolition of Component V of the Partnership Research Program on Forest Management and Environment, as well as the abolition of the support for forestry research, the government is attacking the Office of the Chief Forester. 15 jobs will be cut. Minister Laurent Lessard talks about relocating employees, but in Quebec City, to the detriment of the regions, ”said Sylvain Roy.
Loss of expertise
In the long term, the hon. Member fears that forest planning will suffer from the austerity measures of the Liberal government.
“The data produced by experts from the Office of the Chief Forester are essential for the future of Quebec&#39;s forests. It is thanks to their work that citizens have a clear picture of the state of the forest in Quebec and that decision-makers can put in place the best possible measures to ensure the sustainability of the sector, ”added Sylvain Roy.
The member is also worried about the loss of good jobs in the regions. “Not only are these cuts bad for the future of the forest - we thus lose important expertise, from which all the citizens of Quebec will suffer - they are also dramatic for jobs in forest communities. The government must assume its responsibilities and maintain the budget of the Chief Forester, ”he concluded.
