Quebec - The deputy for Berthier and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, urges the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Paradis, to immediately reinstate the reference &quot;Product of Quebec&quot;.
“Fortunately, thanks to citizens, producers and the Parti Québécois - who immediately denounced the decision - Minister Paradis recognized his mistake and will restore mandatory labeling of Quebec products. That said, it is essential that the mention come back as quickly as possible, so that consumers can obtain reliable information on the origin of their fruits and vegetables, ”declared André Villeneuve.
Minister Pierre Paradis presents the disappearance of the mention &quot;Product of Quebec&quot; as an &quot;unfortunate consequence&quot; of the repeal of a regulation. However, the magazine La Terre de chez nous revealed that the impact assessment produced by the ministry mentioned the withdrawal of this obligation.
&quot;Either Minister Paradis was aware that he was withdrawing the&quot; Product of Quebec &quot;designation by repealing the regulation, or he did not read the impact assessment. If so, should we conclude that he does not read his files before signing the decrees? The fact remains that one way or another, it is very worrying, ”added the member for Berthier.
“Pierre Paradis agreed to bring back mandatory labeling only after popular outcry. By removing the mention &quot;Product of Quebec&quot;, he showed an unacceptable lack of consideration for Quebec producers. Can we still trust him, as he prepares to launch a summit on food? », Concluded the deputy.
