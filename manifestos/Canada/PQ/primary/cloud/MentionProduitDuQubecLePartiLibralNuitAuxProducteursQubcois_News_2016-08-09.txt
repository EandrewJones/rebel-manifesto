Quebec - Reacting to the withdrawal of the obligation to display the words &quot;Product of Quebec&quot; on fruits and vegetables from Quebec, the member for Berthier and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve wonders who the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Paradis, works for.
“Not only does Pierre Paradis not support Quebec producers but, in addition, he works against them. The indication &quot;Product of Quebec&quot; is an essential tool to put our food forward. To withdraw it is to go against the grain of promoting local purchasing! More and more, consumers want to buy fresh products from Quebec; why give them less information? There is no valid reason justifying the withdrawal of this obligation. Minister Paradis, instead of harming the promotion of Quebec fruits and vegetables, should introduce measures to enhance them, ”declared André Villeneuve.
Remember that when it came to power, the Liberal Party put an end to the Food Sovereignty Policy launched by the Parti Québécois government in 2013. “We see here a new illustration that for the government, local purchasing and support for Quebec farmers are not priorities. The Liberal Party is going in the wrong direction. We absolutely must restore the Food Sovereignty Policy and the obligation to display &quot;Product of Quebec&quot; on local fruits and vegetables, &quot;concluded the deputy.
