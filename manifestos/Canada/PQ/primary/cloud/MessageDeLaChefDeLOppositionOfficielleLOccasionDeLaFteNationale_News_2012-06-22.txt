Quebec - Here is the message that the Leader of the Official Opposition and Member of Parliament for Charlevoix, Pauline Marois, is sending to all Quebecers on the occasion of the National Day:
â€œIn recent months, Quebec has experienced exceptional events that have jostled us, which have sometimes been difficult. I think the time has come to come together around our most precious holdings. It can be summed up in a four-letter word: us. We carry it like a standard. It has its roots in the far reaches of our history. From the solidarity of the great crossings that led our ancestors to our shores, to the chores organized to rebuild the neighbour&#39;s burnt barn. It is a helping hand because our crossing is not over and there is still room on this ship. This is a bearer of solidarity. This is a bearer of hope. We are saying that we are stronger together. Cenous is the basis of who we are and especially of what we will be in the future. Quebec within us is the theme of this year&#39;s national holiday. We must take this opportunity to reunite peacefully, joyfully, in the Quebec way. This is what I invite us to do throughout the summer. A Quebec summer that will allow us to come together around our pride. For our national day, I invite you to go out, to walk, to display our colors and our flag. This year, more than ever, let&#39;s come together. Show our pride! Happy National day! &quot;
