Quebec City, August 8, 2017 - The official opposition spokesperson for immigration and cultural communities, Carole Poirier, went to see the state of the situation in the facilities of the Olympic Stadium in Montreal, which has recently been transformed. days in a reception center for migrants who continue to cross the border to seek asylum.
IN SHORT
· The reception of refugees must be done according to the rules and according to our reception capacity.
· After visiting the Stadium, we are reassured about the conditions and the quality of the reception.
· We ask that a special team, made up of people from the two ministries of Immigration and the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Solidarity, be set up so that the study of the files can be done jointly.
· The Quebec Acceptance Certificate, the Federal Temporary Work Permit and the Social Assistance Check should be issued at the same time.
“We are reassured by what we saw during our visit to the Olympic Stadium in Montreal, regarding the conditions and the quality of the reception. We also saw that it was temporary accommodation; migrants are quickly directed to other resources. Having said that, it is hard for us to understand why the Liberal government of Justin Trudeau is so inefficient when it comes to the process of granting work permits. The Quebec government is able to issue a social assistance check quickly, and it is essential that the federal government be just as prompt, so that migrants quickly find work, ”said Carole Poirier.
Without a work permit, recalls the spokesperson, these people will not be able to fully contribute to the development of Quebec and will remain in the pay of the host society, which they certainly do not want. “Quebec and Canada do not have the choice of welcoming applicants, according to international agreements. I ask that we accelerate the process of granting work permits, so that these people can find a job and that they are no longer dependent on Quebec society to meet their needs, ”she said. .
The deadlines must therefore be harmonized, including that linked to the Quebec acceptance certificate. “For this, we ask that a special team be set up, made up of people from the two ministries - federal and Quebec - of Immigration and the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Solidarity, so that the &#39;study of the files can be carried out jointly,&#39; added the deputy.
“The reception of refugees must be done according to the rules and according to our reception capacity. We hope that the government of Quebec and the other opposition parties will support our request, ”concluded Carole Poirier.
