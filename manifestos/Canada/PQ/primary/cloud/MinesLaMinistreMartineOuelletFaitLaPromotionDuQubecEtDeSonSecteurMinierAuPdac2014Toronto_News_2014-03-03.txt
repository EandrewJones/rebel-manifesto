Toronto - Quebec&#39;s Minister of Natural Resources, Martine Ouellet, was in Toronto on March 2-3 for the annual convention of the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC). She took this opportunity to underline the importance of mining activity for the Government of Quebec.
“Representing nearly 45,000 jobs, the mining sector is a pillar of Quebec&#39;s economic development. Our government has taken concrete and structuring measures to support the realization of promising mining projects. In addition to creating a stable, clear and profitable investment environment for all, we want to be an example of responsible mining development. The adoption of the Mining Act in December 2013 is a good example, ”said Martine Ouellet.
The Minister of Natural Resources spoke with more than 300 people about the importance of mining activity for the government of Quebec as part of a meeting for stakeholders in the mining industry interested in Quebec on the sidelines of the PDAC in Toronto. She will also speak at a PDAC information session on the modernization of the legislative framework for mining development, business opportunities and topical projects in Quebec.
Remember that the PDAC annual congress is one of the most important mining congresses in the world, attracting more than 30,000 participants from 125 countries. It brings together around 1,300 exhibitors, including 60 government exhibitors. Quebec is doing well there with its flag. Each year, more than 10,000 visitors visit specialists from the Ministry of Natural Resources who promote Québec&#39;s mineral potential as well as the conditions for carrying out mining activities.
“Quebec is internationally recognized for its expertise, the quality of its workforce and its knowledge of the territory with an extraordinary database accessible to all. The PDAC convention is a great opportunity to make Quebec known, its mineral potential and its business potential, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
