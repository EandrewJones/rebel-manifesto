Montreal– The Minister of Natural Resources, responsible for northern development, Ms. Martine Ouellet, accompanied by the Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Natural Resources (northern affairs section) and Member of Parliament for Ungava, Mr. Luc Ferland, announced today the granting of a mining lease to Métanor Resources inc. for the expansion of its Bachelor Lake gold mining site.
“The expansion of this mining site means maintaining 250 jobs for the next four years. This is good news for the Nord-du-Québec region where the mining industry is an important engine of economic development, ”said Martine Ouellet.
Located in Nord-du-Québec, approximately 225 km from Val-d&#39;Or, the Lac Bachelor mine will immediately begin mining. Gold ore will be processed and smelted at the processing plant on the mine site. Total anticipated production is over 200,000 ounces of gold.
The company&#39;s investment in the Bachelor Lake mine expansion project amounts to $ 96 million.
“The expansion of the Lac Bachelor site will have considerable spinoffs for the Nord-du-Québec region. This is an important lever for development. Our government is taking concrete actions to contribute with partners to the development of the region. Our objective is to deploy the tremendous potential for both economic and social development of the North. And the least we can say is that the Metanor Resources project meets this objective, ”concluded Luc Ferland.
