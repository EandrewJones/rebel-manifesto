Quebec, January 19, 2017 - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for labor, Marc Bourcier, reacted to Minister Dominique Vien&#39;s announcement that the minimum wage will soon be increased by 50 cents to reach 11.25 $ per hour. Although he welcomes this increase, Marc Bourcier is disappointed that the government still refuses to commit to workers to take the means to raise the minimum wage to $ 15.
“We are happy to see that the popular movement, supported by the Parti Québécois, has forced the Liberals to move and announce a higher increase than last year. Unfortunately, the announced hike is not accompanied by a clear plan to raise the minimum wage to $ 15 by 2022, ”the spokesperson said.
&quot;It should be noted that any accelerated increase in the minimum wage must be accompanied by assistance measures for our SMEs, which are currently being taken by the throats of the decisions of the Liberal government and the absence of an ambitious economic plan,&quot; added the Minister. Member of Parliament for Saint-Jérôme.
“The expected increase in the cost of food alone is $ 400 per family in 2017. Add to this the increase in several tariffs and the price of many other goods and services facing Quebecers. To help families, the Parti Québécois proposed a $ 200 increase in the solidarity tax credit, an amount that could be taken from the budget surpluses that the government has made - largely at the expense of income earners. modest, moreover. This measure would help 2.7 million households, more than 200,000 minimum wage workers, ”concluded Marc Bourcier.
