Québec, February 21, 2018 - Sylvain Roy, MP for Bonaventure and official opposition spokesperson for forests, wildlife and parks, denounces the closure of outfitters in Nord-du-Québec by the Minister of Forests , de la Faune et des Parcs, Luc Blanchette, especially since it was rushed and was not necessary.
“Minister Blanchette launched a &#39;strategy for the vitality of northern heritage&#39; last month. At that time, did he know that the Leaf River caribou herd had increased its population by 30,000 head? Either he lied, or he made this announcement without seeing fit to learn about this fundamental aspect which should have greatly influenced his decision &quot;, raised the spokesperson.&quot; The minister opted for the easy method: instead to work to preserve jobs and to give new impetus to the region&#39;s economy, he has chosen to help it die, ”also lamented Sylvain Roy. The deputy also recalls that for their part, the outfitters, eager to save their businesses and the entire wildlife industry, proposed several solutions to the minister. “Unfortunately, Luc Blanchette remained deaf,” he concluded.
