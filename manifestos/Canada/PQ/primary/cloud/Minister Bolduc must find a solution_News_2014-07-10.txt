Québec, July 10, 2014 - The member for Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, denounces the decision of the Minister of Education, Leisure and Sport, Yves Bolduc, to suspend the holding of the Quebec Week of Adults in Training (SQAF), scheduled for spring 2015.
“The government is swimming in contradiction. While he insists on the importance of the professional qualification of the Quebec workforce, so that it responds more to the needs of businesses, he cuts funding to an event that works to promote it in all the regions of Quebec, ”said Dave Turcotte.
The Quebec week of adults in training aims to interest the population in the principle of “lifelong learning”. Bringing together all stakeholders in education, training and work, this event raises awareness among the general public and decision-makers about the many advantages of continuing education, adult education and professional development.
“This news comes as we sadly witnessed the loss of hundreds of jobs this week following several plant closures in Quebec. In this context, the promotion and development of adult training appear to us essential to revive the economy of the affected regions, ”added the deputy.
Remember that the Liberal government cut $ 17 million in employment assistance measures in its budget. “We are still waiting for the so-called liberal effect in terms of economic development and job creation. The government must support workers and take concrete action to enable them to obtain and keep paying jobs, ”concluded the official opposition spokesperson.
