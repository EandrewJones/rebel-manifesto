Québec, July 25, 2014 - Nicole Léger, the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for elementary and secondary education, asks the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports, Yves Bolduc, to intervene immediately in the conflict between the Commission scolaire des Affluents and the Commission scolaire Sir? Wilfrid? Laurier.
Today we learn that the Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board intends to go ahead with the construction of a soccer field on the plot of land that is currently in conflict with the Commission scolaire des Affluents. She wants to build a new elementary school there in order to cope with the strong demographic growth that the municipality of Repentigny is currently experiencing.
A permit has already been requested from the City and the Sir? Wilfrid? Laurier School Board has awarded a contract to a contractor. “The work could start as early as this summer, according to what we learn this morning. Time is running out and the Minister must intervene immediately in order to quickly find a satisfactory solution for all parties ”, declared the MP.
Action by Minister Yves Bolduc is urgent because the negotiations are at a standstill. “The Sir? Wilfrid? Laurier School Board does not seem to intend to negotiate since it is moving forward with its project and no meeting with the Commission scolaire des Affluents is currently scheduled. The minister had asked the parties to come to an agreement by September; if he waits for that date to act, it will be too late, ”concluded Nicole Léger.
