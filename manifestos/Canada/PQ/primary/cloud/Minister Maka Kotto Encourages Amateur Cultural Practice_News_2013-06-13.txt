Quebec - The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, is proud to support amateur cultural practice in fields as varied as music, dance, literature, heritage and cinema, by allocating financial assistance totaling more than $ 1 million to eleven national organizations of young amateur talent and cultural leisure activities.
“Synonymous with quality of life and creativity, cultural leisure energizes Quebec society and increases the commitment of citizens in the cultural development of their community. It is therefore essential to facilitate access to as many people as possible. This investment is also part of our desire to support the artistic and creative vitality of young people, since the practice of a cultural leisure activity is not only formative, but it also cultivates self-esteem and a sense of identity ”, indicated Minister Kotto.
Paid under the Operating Assistance program for national organizations of young amateur talent and cultural leisure, this grant of $ 1,011,160 will allow eleven organizations to pursue their mission, namely to support and promote the activities of hundreds of regional cultural leisure organizations. The latter also provide a framework for cultural practices and organize various activities, where participants can exchange ideas, develop their knowledge, improve their performance and promote their sector of activity.
These organizations greatly contribute to increasing accessibility and participation in culture in all regions of Quebec. Among these, nine are national associations of cultural leisure bringing together choirs, bands, youth symphony orchestras, theater and dance troupes, literary societies, folklorists, parallel cinemas, musical ensembles and historical or genealogical societies. As for the two organizations of young amateur talent, Envol and Macadam, as well as the Intercollegial Network of Sociocultural Activities of Quebec, they support the development of the next generation of artists by organizing events or by promoting meetings with professional artists.
This investment is in addition to the other commitments of the Government of Quebec aimed at supporting the outreach of the arts to young people, such as updating the culture-education memorandum of understanding with the Ministère de l&#39;Éducation, du Loisir et du Sport. and the allocation of a refundable tax credit for artistic and cultural activities for young people aged at least 5 years old, but not yet reaching the age of 16, announced in the 2013-2014 budget of the Government of Quebec.
