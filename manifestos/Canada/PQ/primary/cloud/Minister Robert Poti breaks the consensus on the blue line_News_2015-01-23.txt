Quebec - The MP for Vachon and official opposition spokesperson for transport, Martine Ouellet, denounces the improvisation of the Minister of Transport, Robert Poëti, who announced that the Agence métropolitaine de transport (AMT) will study, at its request, the possibility that the extension of the blue line to the east of Montreal be carried out by surface train.
“The trial and error of the Liberal government in public transit continues. This decision comes out of nowhere; the minister changes the mandate of the project office without explaining why. While it has always been agreed that the extension of the blue line will take the form of a traditional metro, the Minister, without notifying anyone, completely changes course, ”said Martine Ouellet.
The Member also indicates that this change will have several unfortunate consequences for citizens and users. “It&#39;s going to be expensive, because a surface train involves a whole new technology, both in terms of infrastructure and equipment. It will therefore be impossible to integrate a surface train into the technologies already in place for the metro. Add to this the significant delay that the project will take, and the travel time for the 80,000 future users, which will be longer, since they will have to use an additional means of transport. Minister Poëti must step back. According to the AMT, the extension of the blue line will facilitate transport for 140,000 people; the minister must quickly tell them what he intends to do, ”concluded the member for the Parti Québécois.
