Quebec - The member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for elementary and secondary education, Nicole Léger, asks the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports, Yves Bolduc, to prohibit strip searches in schools and immediately clarify the circumstances under which summary searches can be carried out.
“Parents in Quebec were surprised to learn yesterday that the management of their child&#39;s school can strip search if they suspect him of having committed an act that contravenes the establishment&#39;s regulations. I think the parents were amazed to learn that this could happen without them knowing. For us, it is clear: parents must be notified. The case raised yesterday concerned a young underage girl. It does not mean anything! ”Said Nicole Léger.
“Once again yesterday, as usual, the minister made an unfortunate statement. We got the impression that he was taking things lightly. However, today, all parents are troubled and worried. Given that in this affair everything is a question of proportions and means, the Minister must quickly clarify the situation, ”added the deputy.
Three requests for the revision of the terms of reference
In addition, Nicole Léger formulated requests for the upcoming revision of the reference framework of the Ministry of Education concerning the police presence in educational establishments. “We want the minister to change three things: first, he must specifically ban strip searches in schools, to dispel any misunderstanding. Then, when a summary search is carried out, the parents of the minor involved must be notified. Finally, the new frame of reference should clarify the circumstances that allow summary searches to be carried out in a concrete and explicit manner, ”she concluded.
