Québec, November 6, 2014 - Nicole Léger, the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for elementary and secondary education and school perseverance, denounces the Minister of Education and Recreation and from Sport, Yves Bolduc, who refuses to deny the scenario of increased prices for school daycare services, while those for other daycare services will be adjusted according to the parents&#39; income. “The Prime Minister confirmed yesterday that his government will tax middle class families more. The parents of the 180,000 students who attend school day care services want to know if fees will increase. I asked the minister to reassure these parents; he refused to deny a possible increase in the tariff, ”said Nicole Léger. The member for Pointe-aux-Trembles deplores that the government plans to further tax middle-class families. “The Liberals, while they promised during the election campaign to limit the increase in childcare fees to inflation, are doing the complete opposite by introducing a new family tax. By doing so, they are flouting Quebec&#39;s family policy, which is nevertheless the pride of Quebecers and which is mentioned all over the world, ”concluded Nicole Léger. -
