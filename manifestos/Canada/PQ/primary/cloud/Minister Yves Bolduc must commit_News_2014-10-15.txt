Québec, October 15, 2014 - The member for Joliette and official opposition critic for higher education, Véronique Hivon, believes that the Minister of Higher Education, Yves Bolduc, must say whether the direct cuts in the educational programs of Quebec universities are acceptable.
“Some universities have already confirmed that courses will be withdrawn from the schedule in the winter of 2014-2015. Minister Yves Bolduc cannot remain silent as he imposes record cuts on the university network. He must say whether or not it is acceptable to the Liberal government for there to be direct cuts in the supply of courses at universities in Quebec. He must also tell us about the effects of these cuts on the quality of teaching, research and the offer of courses. Finally, transparency requires him to tell us whether the next step in his plan is to increase tuition fees, ”declared Véronique Hivon.
Remember that when it was in opposition, the Liberal Party loudly denounced the financial situation of universities for months. However, we learned today that the Liberal cuts for 2014-2015 will not be $ 172 million, as had been planned since the budget was tabled, but at least $ 200 million.
