Rouyn-Noranda– On tour in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, the Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, in the presence of the member for Rouyn-Noranda-Témiscamingue, Gilles Chapadeau, announced a subsidy of 2,864,500 $ for the modernization of the Petit Théâtre du Vieux Noranda. The mayor of Rouyn-Noranda, Mario Provencher, also participated in the event.
“New modern and friendly installations will delight spectators and artists. This building has a soul and it will soon have all the assets to promote theater and alternative stage creations throughout the region as well as to provide training in the performing arts. Culture plays a predominant role in the quality of life and the development of communities; it is the lifeblood of our towns, villages and regions ”, declared Minister Kotto.
“With a better adapted building, the Petit Théâtre du Vieux Noranda will be able to fully fulfill its mission, which is to provide an alternative place for creation, production, presentation and training for artists in the region. Thanks to this renovation project, the building will contribute to the image of this sector of the city which is transforming itself into the arts district of Old Noranda, ”added MP Chapadeau.
Built in 1948, the Petit Théâtre du Vieux Noranda has been used, since its acquisition in 2001 by the theater troupe Les Zybrides, as a venue for the dissemination of the performing arts and for the holding of various cultural activities. Occupied approximately 200 days a year, this performance hall is a privileged place of access to culture for the citizens of Rouyn-Noranda.
The current project aims for a general upgrade, including the redevelopment of the interior premises and the renewal of specialized equipment, in order to comply with standards affecting the performing arts as well as the comfort and safety of users.
