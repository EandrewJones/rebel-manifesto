Montreal - The Minister of International Relations, La Francophonie and Foreign Trade, Jean-François Lisée, said he was relieved by the announcement made Tuesday by the federal authorities responsible for international development to extend the Volunteer Cooperation Program for an additional year.
This decision comes as the international cooperation organizations (OICs) participating in the program were preparing to repatriate hundreds of aid workers and dismantle infrastructure in several countries of the South.
“This exceptionally late decision is the culmination of several months of pressure from the International Cooperation Organizations of Quebec, the adoption of a unanimous motion by the International Assembly and repeated interventions by our Ministry to the federal authorities. », Specified Minister Lisée, who directly discussed these issues in June, September and November with his federal counterparts.
This extension is only a temporary solution, however, because the authorities of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada are carrying out a general review of international development programs, the orientations of which are not known. OICs are still without news of two other important programs used to finance cooperation projects.
Let us recall that the last few years have been trying for Quebec OICs, which have borne the brunt of major cuts in Canadian international aid budgets in addition to seeing the Quebec share of budgets decrease alarmingly. In constant contact with AQOCI, Minister Lisée is following the file with great attention.
