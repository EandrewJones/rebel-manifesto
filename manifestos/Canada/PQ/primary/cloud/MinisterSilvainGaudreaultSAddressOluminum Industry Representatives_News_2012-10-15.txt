Montreal - The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Member of Parliament for Jonquière, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, is meeting today in Montreal with representatives of the Aluminum Association of Canada ( AAC), which has three of the world&#39;s largest aluminum companies: Alcoa, Aluminerie Alouette Inc. and Rio Tinto Alcan Inc.
&quot;It will be an opportunity for me to share with this structuring and innovative industry that the Government of Quebec recognizes it as a flagship of our economy and as a sector of the future that is part of the perspective of sustainable development&quot;, indicated Mr. Gaudreault.
Quebec is the third largest aluminum exporter on the planet with 7% of world production. More than 10,000 direct jobs as well as a network of 4,500 suppliers and 1,800 processors depend on this industry, which contributes to the economic development of several regions of Quebec.
By using hydroelectricity, the aluminum industry in Quebec uses green energy, which gives it a comparative advantage from an environmental standpoint. Aluminum, by its lightness, contributes to improving the energy efficiency of vehicles. In view of the government&#39;s desire to reduce GHG emissions, it is essential as a material of the future.
“I will take advantage of my visit to this AAC meeting to reiterate Quebec&#39;s commitment to energy independence and transportation electrification. I will also share with representatives of this industry my optimism regarding the contribution of aluminum to the development of transportation in the 21st century, ”concluded Mr. Gaudreault.
