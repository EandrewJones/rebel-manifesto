Quebec - The Minister of Public Security and Minister responsible for the Outaouais region, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, announced today, on behalf of the Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Seniors, Dr. Réjean Hébert , the addition of two beds to the neonatology unit of the Gatineau Health and Social Services Center (CSSS). This addition, which increases the number of beds in the unit from 10 to 12, follows on from a major upgrade that it has just undergone.
In fact, a sum of $ 750,000 was recently invested to enhance the neonatal unit of the CSSS de Gatineau. Of this amount, $ 150,000 was invested by the Gatineau Health Foundation to finance the replacement of twelve physiological monitors. The Outaouais Health and Social Services Agency, for its part, invested $ 250,000 to renovate the premises, in particular through plumbing and electrical work, while the Ministry of Health and Social Services has provided $ 350,000 for the purchase of specialized devices, such as incubators, infusion pumps, non-invasive ventilation devices and phototherapy equipment.
In addition, the Department will allocate an additional annual operating budget of up to $ 500,000 to the CSSS de Gatineau to meet the increase in activities in the neonatal sector.
“This investment is part of an action plan stemming from the 2008-2018 Perinatal Policy. Our government is determined to improve neonatal services across Quebec, particularly in regional centers such as the Gatineau Hospital. In this way, fewer newborns have to be transferred to subspecialty centers. And if there is to be such a transfer, for example in neonatal intensive care units in Ottawa or Montreal, the baby will be able to return to the region more quickly, once his condition has stabilized. In short, more newborns will be able to receive specialized services in their family&#39;s living environment, ”Minister Hébert said.
