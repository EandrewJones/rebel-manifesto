Gatineau– The new satellite dialysis unit at the Papineau Hospital was inaugurated today by the Minister of Public Security and Minister responsible for the Outaouais region, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, at the end of 4,231,000 works. $.
“Creating units like this has the great advantage of bringing services closer to patients. This is of paramount importance for people with chronic kidney disease, as hemodialysis is offered three times a week. This is why we are striving, in the Outaouais as elsewhere in Quebec, to reduce travel times to health care settings as much as possible, for the benefit of people with the disease and their loved ones, ”declared Mr. Bergeron.
The satellite hemodialysis unit was located on the 4th floor of the Papineau Hospital, covering an area of approximately 700 square meters. It has eleven treatment stations, including one in an isolation room and one in reserve, which will eventually allow up to 36 patients to be treated in the eastern part of the region.
The costs of fitting out the premises and acquiring specialized equipment were jointly assumed by the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux ($ 2,000,000), the Agence de la santé et des services sociaux de la Outaouais ($ 931,000), the Center de santé et de services sociaux de Papineau ($ 300,000), as well as the Fondation Santé de Papineau ($ 1,000,000), the latter contribution having been provided by private donors.
“I would like to underline the role played in this project by the team of nephrologists at the Gatineau Health and Social Services Center. Thanks to telemedicine, these specialists are able to provide remote clinical supervision. This is how care is of as good quality and just as safe in satellite units as in large hospitals, with significant gains in terms of accessibility, ”concluded the Minister responsible for Outaouais region.
