Quebec - The Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks and responsible for the Mauricie and Center-du-Québec regions, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet, is pleased to announce, on behalf of the Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, that a subsidy of $ 320,684 is granted to the city of Drummondville for the operation of the public transport service.
This subsidy is paid for the year 2013 as part of the Government Assistance Program for Public Transportation of People (PAGTCP).
“Our government encourages and supports the development of public transit, which makes it possible to optimize the use of the road network while increasing the fluidity of travel, reducing the level of congestion and reducing pollution attributable to the consumption of hydrocarbons. . Today&#39;s announcement will allow the city of Drummondville to consolidate its public transit gains and continue to offer a service that meets the needs of its users, ”said Minister Blanchet.
The operating subsidy component of the PAGTCP aims to support the assumption of responsibility for public transport by municipalities located outside large urban centers, to improve services in terms of frequency and service, as well as offering greater diversity to private carriers called upon to act as service providers to municipalities.
&quot;By participating in the financing of public transit, we are investing in sustainable development and the mobility of people, a social, environmental and economic issue that is at the heart of our government&#39;s mission,&quot; added Mr. Blanchet.
Public transit is one of the cornerstones of the next Québec Sustainable Mobility Policy. Currently being developed, this policy will take over from the Québec Public Transport Policy. The new policy will place the user at the heart of his concerns and will guide the actions that will be undertaken by 2020 with a view to improving the public transport service offer throughout Quebec. The preparatory documents as well as some of the briefs filed during the consultation can be viewed on the website of the Ministère des Transports at www.mtq.gouv.qc.ca.
