Quebec - The Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau, and the Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, today announced the establishment of a working group on the supervision of conditions of sale and service of alcoholic beverages in restaurants.
“The restaurant sector is very important to the Quebec economy, and it is in everyone&#39;s interest that we seek solutions to the irritants that the industry encounters. Our government wishes to act in concert with restaurant owners. This is why, following meetings with representatives of restaurateurs, we agreed to launch a working group to jointly examine the issue raised, ”said Minister Marceau.
“The mandate of the working group will be to ensure the sharing of information and documentation between members and to propose solutions to lighten and modernize the legislative and regulatory framework of the restaurant sector. We will thus help improve the supervision of the conditions of sale and service of alcoholic beverages by Quebec restaurateurs, ”explained Minister Bergeron.
The working group will bring together representatives from the Ministère des Finances et de l&#39;Économie, the Régie des alcools, des courses et des jeux, the Conseil des chains de restaurants du Québec and the Association des restaurateurs du Québec. The Ministère de la Sécurité publique, Revenu Québec and the Société des alcools du Québec may also intervene if necessary.
The task force will provide the government with a report on the state of the discussions, which will propose analyzes and recommendations in the fall of 2013.
