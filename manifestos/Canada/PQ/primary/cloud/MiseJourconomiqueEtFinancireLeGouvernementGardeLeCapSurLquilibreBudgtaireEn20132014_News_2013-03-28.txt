Quebec - The Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau, today presented the economic and financial update for spring 2013. “I confirm that the budget will be balanced in 2013-2014 and that it will be maintained thereafter, as planned in last November&#39;s budget. For 2012-2013, the deficit objective is maintained at $ 1.5 billion, ”he declared.
In terms of economic growth, after real GDP growth of 1.0% in 2012, economic growth in Quebec should stand at 1.3% in 2013 and 1.8% in 2014. For these two years , this is a downward revision of 0.2 percentage point compared to the forecast in the budget of November 2012. The minister indicated that the economy continues to grow, but at a more moderate pace than expected due to the fragile global economic context and uncertainties relating to the financial and budgetary situation in the euro zone and the United States.
In addition, the Minister stressed that the labor market remains robust in Quebec. “30,800 jobs were created in 2012, an increase of 0.8% compared to 2011. The unemployment rate remained stable at 7.8%, but it is expected to decline next year, dropping to 7 , 5% in 2013 and 7.4% in 2014, ”he said.
The minister confirmed that the government intends to meet the budgetary objectives established last November, despite adjustments to government revenues. The monitoring of budgetary revenue and the downward revision of the economic outlook lead to a drop in the government&#39;s own-source revenue of around $ 250 million in 2012-2013 and $ 565 million in 2013-2014.
&quot;These shortfalls will be fully offset by a downward revision of the debt service due to low interest rates, by an increase in equalization income resulting from the update of economic and fiscal data and finally by the &#39;partial use of contingency provisions that had been incorporated into the financial framework of last November,&#39; he explained.
The minister indicated that rigorous expenditure management should be maintained. “The government has taken the necessary steps to absorb the significant overruns noted in September 2012. The spending targets established last November have been maintained. The level of program spending in 2012-2013 is still forecast at $ 62,642 million, an increase of 1.9%. Growth will also stand at 1.9% in 2013-2014, ”he explained.
The Minister reiterated that the government is pursuing the debt reduction objectives, namely to reduce the gross debt to 45% of GDP and the debt representing accumulated deficits to 17% of GDP as of March 31, 2026.
He pointed out that the revenues resulting from the indexation of the price of heritage electricity from 2014, all mining royalties from 2015-2016, the revenues resulting from the increase in Hydro-Québec&#39;s net profit related to when the Gentilly-2 nuclear power station is closed from 2017-2018, and the revenues resulting from the increase in the specific tax on alcoholic beverages will be paid into the Generations Fund. Thus, for 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, sums of nearly $ 1.4 billion will be paid into the Generations Fund for debt reduction.
The Minister recalled that at the end of the Summit on Higher Education, which was held on February 25 and 26, the government confirmed that it will invest nearly 1.8 billion additional dollars over seven years. for the financing of universities and that it will index tuition fees in line with the growth in disposable income per capita in order to take into account the ability of Quebecers to pay. &quot;Our government confirms its commitment to universities by providing them with stable and sustainable funding representing an average annual growth of 4.2% by 2018-2019,&quot; he explained.
The government has also made a commitment to increase financial assistance for students, in particular by increasing the income threshold beyond which the parental contribution to the loans and bursaries plan is considered to be just over $ 28,000. at $ 45,000. Additional improvements will be made to student financial assistance.
&quot;Ultimately, the increase in the parental contribution threshold will benefit some 49,000 students, who will see their financial assistance increase by $ 1,350 per year on average,&quot; said the Minister.
The improvement in financial assistance for studies will be offset by the reduction in the rate of the tax credit for tuition and examination fees from 20% to 8%.
“After four years of deficits, Quebec will return to balanced budgets in 2013-2014. Today&#39;s update maintains this objective while taking into account changing economic conditions. It is necessary to continue rigorous management of our expenses. In this way, we will achieve the objectives we have set for ourselves and return to a balanced budget, ”the Minister concluded.
