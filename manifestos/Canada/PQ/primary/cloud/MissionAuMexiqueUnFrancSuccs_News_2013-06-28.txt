Mexico - The economic and trade mission to Mexico by the Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, was a resounding success. In three particularly intensive days, it enabled more than 100 participants representing 73 SMEs, associations and research institutions to hold more than 400 business meetings with Mexican partners.
During a lunch-conference organized by Quebec, in conjunction with three major Mexican trade associations, the Premier delivered an address to an audience made up of 340 business personalities, including 250 from Mexico. “This activity allowed me to see the strength of the relationship between Quebec and Mexico. On this occasion, everyone understood the need to strengthen and increase economic exchanges between partners within the framework of NAFTA ”, declared Ms. Marois.
