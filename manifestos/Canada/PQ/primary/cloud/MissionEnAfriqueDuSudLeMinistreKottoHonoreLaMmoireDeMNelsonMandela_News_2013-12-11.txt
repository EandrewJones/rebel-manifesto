Quebec - The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, has been appointed as the official representative of the Government of Quebec to participate in the farewell ceremonies for Nelson Mandela, in South Africa, on behalf of the Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois.
On the morning of December 11, 12 and 13, a procession will follow the remains of Nelson Mandela through the streets of Pretoria. On Friday December 13, Minister Kotto will go to the Burning Chapel before the remains are transported to the native village of Nelson Mandela, to then be buried alongside his relatives, on Sunday December 15.
“From now on, the name of Nelson Mandela is inscribed on the short list of the liberators of the people. His fight transcends borders and brings us back to basics: human equality and the meaning of life. To be free, to live in peace, to have access to happiness, ”said Maka Kotto.
“Africa and the whole world have become bigger, more beautiful, more noble after his passage, and we owe him eternal gratitude. I believe that it is by continuing, everywhere on the planet, the fight for freedom and equality among all that we can pay him the most beautiful homage. &quot;
Nelson Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo. Eager to fight injustices and fight for the recognition of equal rights, he obtained a law degree and then joined the African National Congress in 1942. Increasingly defying the apartheid regime, he was arrested and sentenced to five years of penitentiary. New charges are then brought against him, which earns him life imprisonment. In 1990, Nelson Mandela became a free man again, after being imprisoned for twenty-seven years. On May 10, 1994, Mandela was sworn in as South Africa&#39;s first black president.
A hundred heads of state or government, current or former, crowned heads, spiritual leaders or artists have confirmed their presence in South Africa, at the official ceremonies of homage to Nelson Mandela.
