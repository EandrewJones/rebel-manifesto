Quebec - &quot;During his trip to Riyadh in the coming days, Minister Sam Hamad must directly appeal to the government of Saudi Arabia so that it allows the immediate return of Nathalie Morin and her three children to Quebec&quot;.
This is what the member for Lac-Saint-Jean and official opposition spokesperson for international relations and Francophonie, Alexandre Cloutier, asks after learning that a minister from the Charest government will be in Saudi Arabia.
The case of Nathalie Morin, this young Quebecer held against her will in Saudi Arabia since March 2005 by her husband, Saeed Al-Shahrani, has largely mobilized Quebec public opinion. She is physically and psychologically abused, lacks food and lives locked in an apartment to which only Saeed Al-Shahrani has the key. Her three young children, Samir, Abdullah and Sarah, suffer the same abuse. Even today, Saudi Arabia does not allow Ms. Morin and her children to leave the country.
“Minister Hamad cannot limit himself to doing business in Saudi Arabia. He is responsible, on behalf of the Quebec government, to get the Saudi authorities to quickly issue the necessary documents to allow Ms. Morin to leave the country. Canada has already fulfilled all the conditions necessary to welcome Ms. Morin and her family, ”said Alexandre Cloutier.
The Member recalled that the National Assembly adopted two motions supporting the steps aimed at allowing Nathalie Morin and her children to return to Quebec. “Last June, the Premier of Quebec, Jean Charest, said he was concerned and pledged to do everything for the return of Ms. Morin. Minister Hamad therefore has a duty to represent Quebec and carry out the mandate given by its Prime Minister and the National Assembly to put an end to the violation of the fundamental rights of Ms. Morin and her three children. It is high time they returned to Quebec, ”concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
