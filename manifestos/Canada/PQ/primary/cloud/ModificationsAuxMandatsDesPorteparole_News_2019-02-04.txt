“The two newly elected members of our political party, Méganne Perry Mélançon and Joël Arseneau, will have more responsibilities, having quickly proven their value and their ability to defend the issues entrusted to them. Culture, communications and the French language are areas of primary importance to the Parti Québécois; today we associate them with spokespersons who could not be more vigilant and dynamic, who will not hesitate to step up to the plate to put forward our points of view ”, first indicated the parliamentary leader.
“Harold LeBel is taking over regional development and rural issues. He has already made a first proposal in connection with them, during our presessional caucus, in order to respond to the labor shortage and to encourage seniors to remain in the labor market, two major challenges in our regions. Finally, Martin Ouellet will henceforth be responsible for work-related files; it is an area that he knows well and for which his expertise will be put to good use, ”added Pascal Bérubé.
