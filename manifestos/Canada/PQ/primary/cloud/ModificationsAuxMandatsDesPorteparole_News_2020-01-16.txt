Quebec, January 16, 2020 - The member for Matane-Matapédia and parliamentary leader of the Parti Québécois, Pascal Bérubé, made some adjustments to the distribution of spokesperson files within the parliamentary wing of the Parti Québécois.
IN SHORT
A fundamental issue for the Parti Québécois, the French language becomes the responsibility of the parliamentary leader. “I will continue the excellent work accomplished by Joël Arseneau in order to put forward our proposals to promote French and strengthen Bill 101; they are numerous, relevant and can be applied quickly, ”said Pascal Bérubé.
For his part, Joël Arseneau is entrusted with the important responsibility of the health file. “The Caquista government is currently struggling to fulfill its commitments in this area, and we are convinced that Joël will be able to effectively and eloquently defend the interests of Quebecers, who demand better access to health care. At the same time, we are thereby easing the parliamentary responsibilities of Sylvain Gaudreault during the leadership race, ”continued the parliamentary leader.
Finally, Harold LeBel becomes spokesperson for social services. “Harold is a person of heart; its commitment to vulnerable people is constant and sincere. This new responsibility comes in addition to its mandates in terms of social solidarity and for the elderly, in particular, and which it already fulfills brilliantly. The heavy workload of Lorraine Richard&#39;s role as commissioner of the Laurent commission, where she does useful work for the protection of children, made this adjustment necessary, ”said Pascal Bérubé.
