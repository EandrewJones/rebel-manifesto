Quebec - The MNA for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, and the MNA for Terrebonne and Family Critic, Mathieu Traversy, announce that the Official Opposition will table a motion of censure in the National Assembly asking parliamentarians to withdraw their confidence in the Liberal government.
“The Prime Minister promised during the election campaign, but also during his opening speech, not to raise the prices of childcare services beyond inflation. Today&#39;s rate adjustment announcement therefore means that he lied to families in Quebec. However, given that several parliamentarians, even Liberals, have apparently expressed reservations about this measure, we would like them to speak out for the citizens and families of their constituencies and to vote in favor of our motion ”, supported Stéphane Bédard.
“The families of the middle class are directly attacked by the modulation of the tariffs. They were betrayed by the government. They are disappointed and worried about the future. What budget item will they have to sacrifice? With the implementation of this family tax, the government is slashing Quebec&#39;s family policy, ”concluded Mathieu Traversy.
