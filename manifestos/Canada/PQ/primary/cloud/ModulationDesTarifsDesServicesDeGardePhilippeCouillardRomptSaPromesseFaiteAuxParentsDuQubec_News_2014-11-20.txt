Quebec - The member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, and the member for Terrebonne and family spokesperson, Mathieu Traversy, denounce the decision of the Liberal government to adjust the prices of childcare services according to the parents&#39; income. This is a real betrayal on the part of the Prime Minister, who promised, during the election campaign, not to increase tariffs beyond inflation.
“The Prime Minister is breaking his promise today to parents in Quebec, who are disappointed and worried. This is a big step backwards for the political community. What will be the impacts on middle class families? Once again, they are the victims of liberal austerity. How can the minister claim to care about these families when modulation attacks them directly? In which budget item will they have to cut? What difficult decisions will they have to make in order to pay this new tax? », Asked Stéphane Bédard.
The member also deplores that the government has remained deaf to the numerous demonstrations of families and stakeholders in the childcare network, who demanded that our family policy be safeguarded.
&quot;While today we are celebrating the International Day of the Rights of the Child and our family policy is the pride of all Quebecers, the government has decided to slash its measures, thanks to which young parents have been able to reconcile life. family, work and study. Women have been able to enter the labor market en masse. Children benefit from accessible and quality childcare services dedicated to their development and well-being. The government is axing this family policy, and families will pay the price, ”concluded Mathieu Traversy.
