Quebec - The Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, and the Minister of International Relations, La Francophonie and Foreign Trade, and Minister responsible for the Montreal region, Mr. Jean-François Lisée, congratulate the new mayor and salute the speed with which the elected officials of the City of Montreal proceeded to the election of a new mayor.
“I would first like to congratulate Mr. Laurent Blanchard on his election and assure him of my full cooperation. I also want to thank all of the City of Montreal&#39;s elected officials for exercising their right to vote with rigor and commitment despite a difficult context, ”said Minister Gaudreault.
“This quick election shows that Montreal&#39;s institutions are working. Our government remains available to support, if necessary, the elected representatives of the City of Montreal so that the projects follow their course and that services to citizens are provided by the next municipal elections, ”added Minister Lisée.
Let us recall that the Act respecting elections and referendums in municipalities enacts that when the vacancy of the post of mayor is noted in the 12 months preceding the day fixed for the poll of the next general election and that the council has not decreed that it must be filled by a by-election, the councilors must, within 30 days of the notice of the vacancy, elect one of them to this position.
