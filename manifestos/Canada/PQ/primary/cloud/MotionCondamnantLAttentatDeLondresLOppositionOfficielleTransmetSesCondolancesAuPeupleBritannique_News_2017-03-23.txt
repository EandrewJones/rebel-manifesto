Quebec - In the wake of the attack committed near the British parliament in London, the Parti Québécois supported a motion presented to the National Assembly expressing the solidarity of the Quebec nation towards the British.
“Horror claimed innocent lives again yesterday in London. We learn today that the population of Antwerp, Belgium, has been the subject of a similar attempt. These unspeakable attacks challenge us because they target our most cherished values. But our democratic, pluralist and humanist societies cannot be shaken and will demonstrate the necessary resilience under the circumstances. All our thoughts are with the bereaved and the victims of this terrorist act, ”declared the leader of the official opposition, Jean-François Lisée.
For his part, Stéphane Bergeron, spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in international relations, intervened very deeply. “Parliament is the people&#39;s house. To attack this institution is to attack the very essence of democracy, of freedom. I also have a thought for those who, on a daily basis, put their own safety at stake to ensure our own. Every morning, we have the chance and the privilege to wake up in a peaceful and safe society. But, if we can benefit from such tranquility, it is because thousands of people watch over us, day and night, 365 days a year. Unfortunate events like those in London yesterday and in Antwerp today remind us that we must never let our guard down. &quot;
