Quebec - The member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, and the member for Terrebonne and family spokesperson, Mathieu Traversy, demand that the Prime Minister back down on the adjustment of the tariffs of childcare services, a measure that breaks another of its electoral promises and that Quebec families denounce.
“The Prime Minister was elected by promising to cancel the $ 2 increase in the price of child care services, which had been announced before the election: the first broken promise. Then, he knew the real situation of public finances when he entrusted the minister with the task of developing the network and preventing a tariff shock; he therefore reneged on his word for the second time. Quebeckers did not vote for that; the government has deliberately broken the bond of trust with the population, ”declared Stéphane Bédard.
Added to this is the halt in the development of child care spaces, as confirmed, quietly, by the Liberal government in a press release on November 20.
“This other betrayal greatly disappoints families and worries parents who are looking for a place in child care for their little one. Instead of fulfilling its commitment and developing childcare spaces, the government is slowing down almost the majority of projects and opening the door wide to non-subsidized private daycares, ”added Mathieu Traversy.
“Liberal MPs had the opportunity today to speak out for families in their ridings. However, they voted to support the government, despite the fact that it betrayed families by reneging on the election promise it made to them. It will be up to them to explain to parents their decision to support the breaking of their Prime Minister&#39;s promise, ”concluded the leader of the official opposition.
