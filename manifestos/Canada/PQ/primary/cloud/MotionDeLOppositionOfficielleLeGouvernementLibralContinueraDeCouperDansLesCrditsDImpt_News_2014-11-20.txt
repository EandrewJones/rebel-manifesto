Quebec - The member for Rousseau and official opposition critic for finance and revenue, Nicolas Marceau, denounces the Liberal intentions to continue to cut tax credits for businesses. The government voted against a motion calling for the maintenance of these tax credits, presented today to the National Assembly by the deputy.
“This week, Minister Jacques Daoust threw a stone in the pond by declaring himself in disagreement with the cuts in tax credits. These cuts are hurting economic development and job creation. In several areas of excellence in Quebec, these tax credits have enabled many businesses to grow and make their mark. Moreover, despite the current economic situation, where 82,000 full-time jobs have been lost since the Liberals came to power, they still do not have an economic plan. All they offer businesses is uncertainty and worry, ”said Nicolas Marceau.
The motion that the government and the CAQ refused to support reads as follows:
&quot;That the National Assembly approve the position of the Minister of the Economy, Innovation and Exports according to which it is necessary to maintain the tax credits intended for video game companies, aeronautics, technologies of the information and cultural enterprises. &quot;
“The CAQ, for its part, has shown its usual amateurism by demanding that the government reduce tax assistance to businesses by $ 2 billion, which represents practically all of the amounts currently allocated. François Legault had the opportunity to learn, during the debate surrounding the motion, that the appropriations that can be modified or abolished do not total $ 4 billion, as he has claimed on several occasions, but rather half of this amount. . Are we to understand that the head of the CAQ wants to cut all tax assistance granted to businesses? », Nicolas Marceau concluded.
