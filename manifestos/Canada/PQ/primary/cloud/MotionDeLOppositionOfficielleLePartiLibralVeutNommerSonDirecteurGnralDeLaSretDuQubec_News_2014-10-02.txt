Quebec - The member for Matane-Matapédia and official opposition spokesperson for public security, Pascal Bérubé, deplores the fact that the Liberal government voted against a motion that would have exceptionally resulted in the next director general of the Sûreté du Québec (SQ) be appointed by the parliamentarians of the National Assembly.
“The Liberal Party has been raided by police and is currently under investigation. He cannot name the next head of the Sûreté du Québec, that would be quite simply unacceptable! Why refuse that parliamentarians hear the prospective candidates? Why refuse that the next director general of the SQ be appointed by parliamentarians? Why these maneuvers by the Minister of Public Security to avoid being transparent? “Asked Pascal Bérubé.
“When she was appointed, the Minister of Public Security, Lise Thériault, said that she intended to make the process for appointing the director of the SQ more transparent. Unfortunately, we now understand that these were just fine words and that she personally intends to choose who will be the next number one in the SQ, ”added the deputy.
The motion rejected by the Liberals called on the Committee on Institutions to hear the three candidates recommended by the selection committee set up by the Minister of Public Security.
