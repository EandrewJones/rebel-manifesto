Quebec - André Villeneuve, the member for Berthier and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in the areas of agriculture, food, SMEs, entrepreneurship and innovation, calls on the government to support his motion demanding that the federal government maintain integral supply management. The motion, which will be debated tomorrow, reads as follows:
“That in the context of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, the National Assembly demand that the federal government maintain full supply management and that it not make any concessions granting increased market access for dairy products, poultry and eggs, as requested by agricultural producers. &quot;
The member wants the National Assembly to speak with a united voice to defend agricultural producers. “Producers are mobilizing against a federal government that ignores their interests. With this motion, we offer the Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, as well as the other political parties the possibility of forming a united front so that the National Assembly gives its support to the farmers, who demand the full maintenance of the management of the offer. Any concession would have disastrous consequences for producers, ”declared André Villeneuve.
In Quebec, there are more than 7,000 farms whose production is under supply management. The survival of many of them will be threatened if Canada grants increased market access through the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
“The thousands of Quebec farmers who will be affected if the federal government abdicates its responsibilities need the unanimous support of the Members of the National Assembly. I invite parliamentarians to send a clear message to Ottawa: we must not make any concessions on supply management, ”concluded the member for Berthier.
