Quebec - The member for Sanguinet and official opposition critic for labor and pensions, Alain Therrien, deplores the fact that the Liberal government has refused to commit to municipalities submitting up-to-date actuarial valuations to the Régie des rentes du Québec, so that the work on Bill 3 is done in full knowledge of the facts.
“This is a crucial bill for the future of Quebec. We all agree that ensuring the sustainability of municipal pension plans is important. We don&#39;t want to look at it in a hurry; we want very precise information on the extent of the problem. It is sad to see that Minister Pierre Moreau refused to support us so that we can properly begin the detailed study of the bill, ”said Alain Therrien.
The motion defeated by the Liberals reads as follows:
“That the National Assembly demand that municipalities and cities provide, before September 30, 2014, their actuarial valuations updated to December 31, 2013 to the Régie des rentes du Québec;
That the Régie des rentes du Québec send these actuarial valuations, before October 9, 2014, to the Secretariat of the Committees of the National Assembly;
And that this motion be an order of the Assembly. &quot;
