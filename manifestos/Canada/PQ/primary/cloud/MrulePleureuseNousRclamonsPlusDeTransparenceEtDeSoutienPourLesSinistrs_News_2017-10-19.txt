Québec, October 19, 2017 - The member for Rimouski, Harold LeBel, and the official opposition critic for housing, Catherine Fournier, ask the government to make public the report of the interministerial committee created in 2016 responsible for to document the problem of the weeping dry rot, a fungus nicknamed &quot;building cancer&quot;. At the same time, they are calling for a plan to fight this scourge and for a disaster relief fund.
IN SHORT
Weeping dry rot is a fungus affecting an increasing number of constructions in Quebec. Detected too late, it can lead to the destruction of affected buildings, outright. Causing allergies and various other respiratory problems, it also represents a real public health issue.
“For the past three years, I have been accompanying a couple struggling with weeping rot in a municipality in my riding. Like many other Quebec families, he feels alone in the face of this situation, helpless, without means. All of these people are calling for rapid action from the government, clear support that will help them get through this ordeal, which is difficult physically, morally and financially, ”mentioned the Member for Rimouski.
“Homeowners faced with weeping rot often have to leave their homes. Either temporarily, if decontamination can suffice, or permanently, if they are forced to demolish. And they have to bear all the costs! Private insurance does not cover this type of loss, and public security does not consider dry rot as a mass loss. This situation therefore causes a great deal of distress. Some people have nowhere to go. Others had to declare bankruptcy. We must help them, ”insisted Catherine Fournier.
