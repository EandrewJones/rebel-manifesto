Quebec - The MNA for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, Stéphane Bédard, as well as the MNA for Gaspé and spokesperson for municipal affairs, Gaétan Lelièvre, ask the Premier to show respect and honesty towards taxpayers; to do this, he has the duty to meet the mayors, in order to give them clear indications, instead of sending them an ultimatum and threatening them.
“It is clear that we are all part of the &#39;morons&#39; who sincerely thought that the new fiscal pact would lead to generalized tax increases for all taxpayers in Quebec. And it was. What is unfortunate is that Minister Moreau thought that no one was going to notice. And here, what I understand is that he now wants the tax increases to be maintained, but that the name of the Liberal Party is not associated with them. It&#39;s still pretty incredible. It&#39;s mean. It lacks honesty, it lacks respect. What I am asking the Prime Minister to do is to act quickly, to meet with the mayors. Because the government and its minister have lost all credibility, ”declared Stéphane Bédard.
“If the government did not want citizens to see their taxes increased, it should have made another choice than increasing the tax burden on families by $ 500 million. In addition, he passed a bill on taxpayers, letting them believe, falsely, that they would not pay the price. Faithful to the good old liberal recipe, the government of Philippe Couillard centralizes, cuts resources in the regions and passes on tax increases to municipalities. He must now take responsibility for his actions and explain them to the population, ”concluded Gaétan Lelièvre.
