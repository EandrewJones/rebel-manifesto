Quebec - The member for Joliette and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, deplores the imminent closure of the archives of the Museums of Civilization of Quebec.
“Access to the archives of the Museums of Civilization will be closed for an indefinite period. This bad news is another example of the damaging impacts of liberal austerity. Suddenly, a whole part of our national heritage - so important to our researchers that it is recognized by UNESCO - is disappearing. For two years, this government has managed cultural and heritage institutions in a deplorable way. He shows total improvisation, ”denounced the member for Joliette.
“The government is fully responsible for what is happening. What we are witnessing today is exactly the kind of situation that arises when decisions are submitted to the accounting and short-term vision of the Treasury Board, rather than being taken in the light of a real cultural vision. And, once again, as has become the rule, Minister Fortin watches the disaster with folded arms. That can not continue! », Added Véronique Hivon.
