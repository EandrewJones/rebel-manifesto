“You have succeeded in making local culture shine by singing arias by our most illustrious artists such as Jean-Pierre Ferland, Gilles Vigneault and Leonard Cohen. You fell in love with Quebec, and Quebeckers have returned this affection to you. As an ambassador, you carried your message everywhere, to the four corners of the planet, mainly in defense of children&#39;s rights. You are an exceptional woman and an atypical diva. Nana Mouskouri, it is an honor for me to welcome you and present you, on behalf of the people of Quebec, with the insignia of an officer of the National Order of Quebec, ”declared the Premier.
