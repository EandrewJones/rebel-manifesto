Québec, August 15, 2017 - The official opposition spokesperson for secularism, Agnès Maltais, today presented the main points of the amendments that she will be tabling during the detailed study of the bill on religious neutrality of the state.
IN SHORT
“The changes we wanted to see in the bill were sent to the Liberal government almost a year ago. The Minister of Justice took a long time, under the pretext of submitting her amendment proposals to the Liberal caucus before resuming consideration of the bill. We hope she has done her homework. This bill must represent a step forward for Quebec and not a step backwards, as is the case with the original version, ”Agnès Maltais first insisted.
The spokesperson recalls certain significant amendments proposed last fall: &quot;We must include the principle of the secularism of the State and that of equality between women and men in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. . It is also necessary to prohibit the signs of religious conviction for the people in position of authority, and to add the duty of reserve of the civil servants ”, she enumerated.
“It is also essential to remove from the bill the exception concerning the prohibition of the covered face in the provision and reception of public services, and to add to it the express prohibition of wearing the chador in the Quebec public service. Finally, we must regain control over requests for religious accommodation and draw up guidelines so that practices in this matter are clear and uniform throughout the two major public service networks, ”concluded Agnès Maltais.
