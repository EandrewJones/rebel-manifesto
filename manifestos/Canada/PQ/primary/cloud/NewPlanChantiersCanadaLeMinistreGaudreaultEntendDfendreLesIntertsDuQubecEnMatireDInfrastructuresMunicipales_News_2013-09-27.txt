Gatineau– The Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, wishes to take advantage of the presence of the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs, Mr. Denis Lebel, at the meeting of provincial and territorial ministers responsible for local governments to present its demands under the next Building Canada Plan.
“It is essential to defend the interests of Quebec. That is why I intend to make the federal government understand that municipal affairs fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces and territories. This is a fundamental principle that must be respected, ”declared Mr. Gaudreault.
In this sense, the Minister wishes to recall that he is opposed to any direct intervention by the federal government with the municipalities. However, Quebec municipalities have great infrastructure needs and, to meet them, massive investments will have to be made in the coming years. The Quebec government therefore expects to receive its fair share of federal infrastructure funds.
“For the sake of efficiency, I reiterate the importance that this part of the funding be transferred to us en bloc. This way of proceeding will accelerate the start-up of projects and promote our economic growth, ”added the Minister.
Among the Minister&#39;s other demands, let us emphasize that he is demanding that the federal government&#39;s negotiation schedule be adjusted since it does not suit the Quebec reality and that it endangers the next construction season in the municipalities.
&quot;I hope that the demands that I will present during this meeting will be heard and lead to concrete actions on the part of the federal government,&quot; the Minister concluded.
