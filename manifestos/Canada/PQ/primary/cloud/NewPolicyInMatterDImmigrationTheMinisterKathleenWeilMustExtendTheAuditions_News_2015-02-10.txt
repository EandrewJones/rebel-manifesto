Quebec– The member for Bourget and official opposition spokesperson for immigration, Maka Kotto, asks Minister Kathleen Weil to extend the hearings of the public consultation Towards a new Quebec policy on immigration, diversity and inclusion.
“We need more time to hear from groups and citizens. Many people want to participate in this consultation. All the opinions relevant to the work relating to the new immigration policy must be presented to parliamentarians. The minister concocted her consultation document behind closed doors with groups she personally selected last summer. She even made them sign a confidentiality agreement. So there are groups that have had the privilege of being heard twice. Why some and not others? Why a confidentiality agreement? Obviously, the minister has her idea in mind for the new policy. For our part, we believe that everyone must be heard, for the sake of transparency and fairness, ”said Maka Kotto.
The MP stressed the importance of this work on the new immigration policy. &quot;So many issues must be taken into account by the Minister, including the place that French will occupy in the new policy, the problems of underemployment and discrimination affecting immigrants and adopted citizens, regionalization , the diversity of basins, the recognition of skills, the definition of the concept of interculturalism. To do the job properly, the public consultation must be extended, ”concluded Maka Kotto.
