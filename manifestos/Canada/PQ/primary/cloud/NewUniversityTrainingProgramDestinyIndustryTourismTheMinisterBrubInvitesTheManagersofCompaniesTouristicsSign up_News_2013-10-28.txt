Quebec - The Minister for Tourism, Pascal Bérubé, invites managers of the tourism industry to register for a training program designed for them. The program is offered by the Center de perfectionnement of the School of Management Sciences (ESG) of the University of Quebec in Montreal (UQAM).
This training program aims to develop skills for managers of Quebec tourism businesses, taking into account the particularities and challenges of this industry. Spanning seven days, from November 2013 to February 2014, the training activities will focus on diverse subjects such as the challenges of the tourism industry, tourism marketing, innovation and new models in tourism, management in context of change and more.
“The training offered by ESG represents an interesting offer for all managers of the tourism industry to have access to training that concerns them directly. The program has been tailor-made to meet the specific needs and challenges of the tourism industry. I strongly encourage network stakeholders to take advantage of this opportunity by registering now for the training program, the first activity of which is scheduled for November 20, ”said Minister Bérubé.
