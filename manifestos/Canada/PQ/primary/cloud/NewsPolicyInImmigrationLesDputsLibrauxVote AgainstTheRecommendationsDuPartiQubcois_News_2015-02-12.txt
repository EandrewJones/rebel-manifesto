Quebec - The member for Bourget and official opposition critic for immigration and responsible for the Charter of the French language, Maka Kotto, deplores the fact that the Liberal government majority has remained completely closed to the recommendations he made , while the Committee on Citizen Relations met for a working session following public consultations on the documents entitled Towards a New Quebec Policy on Immigration, Diversity and Inclusion.
“In addition to refusing to hear from several groups and citizens who wanted to participate in the consultations, the Liberal deputy rejected all of our recommendations. Minister Weil already had one idea in mind, which was to listen to the groups she had previously chosen for in camera consultations. It is therefore not surprising that the Liberal deputies, in their turn, also rejected any proposal aimed at improving the new immigration policy, ”declared Maka Kotto.
Since the minister categorically refused to continue public consultations, the member for Bourget saw fit to share a series of nine recommendations with her. However, they were all rejected. &quot;By adopting this posture of refusal, the liberal deputies voted in particular against the availability of resources in the regions for the integration of immigrants, against the maintenance of the requirements in terms of fluency in French, and against the dissociation of immigration policy. that of the fight against fundamentalism, ”denounced Maka Kotto.
