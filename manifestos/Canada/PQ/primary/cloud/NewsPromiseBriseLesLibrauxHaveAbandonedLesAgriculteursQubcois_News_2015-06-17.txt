Quebec City - Berthier MP and spokesman for the official opposition on agriculture, fisheries and food, André Villeneuve, laments that the government is dropping farmers by giving up repaying the accumulated deficit of La Financière agricole , as he had committed himself in 2009.
“The Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, is reneging on his government&#39;s word; the latter had clearly committed to paying off the debt of La Financière agricole and increasing its financing to $ 600 million. However, not only did it go back on these commitments, but it also cut $ 151 million from the budgets of La Financière agricole! », Denounced André Villeneuve.
&quot;The mission of La Financière agricole being to support and promote the development of the agricultural and agrifood sector in Quebec, how will it be able, in this context of austerity, to fulfill its mandate with producers? », Continued the spokesperson.
“By doing this, the minister is creating a climate of concern that discourages investment. It is a dangerous message that he sends to farmers, who need much more support and predictability. Should we remind him that, as Minister of Agriculture, his main role is to support agricultural producers? », Concluded the deputy for Berthier.
