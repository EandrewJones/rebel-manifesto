Quebec - Troubled by the information published this morning in the daily Le Devoir concerning the Laval administration headed by Gilles Vaillancourt, the member for Blainville and official opposition spokesperson for municipal affairs, Daniel Ratthé, hopes that this this time, the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Laurent Lessard, will take the matter seriously enough and act accordingly.
“Quebecers do not accept the current impunity. They want change and demand that those who do not respect the law be punished. They want a public commission of inquiry and they are right; it is not by playing ostrich, as the Liberal government is doing, that they will be satisfied. Minister Laurent Lessard must finally act, ”declared Daniel Ratthé, recalling having questioned the Liberal government on several occasions in the National Assembly over the past year on the municipal administration in Laval.
He criticizes the Liberal government for using double standards against certain municipal governments. “In the case of Mascouche, the Minister of Municipal Affairs had no embarrassment last winter to ask the mayor to think about his future. Why does he not do the same with the mayor of Laval, where disturbing information concerning him is increasing? Asks Mr. Ratthé.
To this information unveiled today about political financing by public funds is added the scandal of wetlands, as well as the concentration of engineering contracts awarded to the same firms and the alleged attempt at corruption unveiled by the Liberal MP. de Vimont, Vincent Auclair, and the former Minister of Justice and Public Security, Serge Ménard.
“Laurent Lessard must demonstrate that the Liberal government wants probity in the municipal world, even if the Liberal Party needs Gilles Vaillancourt for the elections, as former minister Thomas Mulcair said. Speaking is no longer enough, we need actions, ”concluded Daniel Ratthé.
