Quebec - The Minister for Native Affairs, Ms. Élizabeth Larouche, says she is confident to reach a final agreement by October 21, 2013 on the issue of the Nation-to-Nation Agreement concerning the management of natural resources.
“I am happy that our government and the Atikamekw have agreed to a three-month extension of this negotiation. Several issues are about to be resolved. I have no doubt that this short time frame will allow us to find common ground. &quot;
Remember that last summer, the government of Quebec and the Atikamekw nation agreed to give themselves until July 21, 2013 to reach a final agreement aimed in particular at: guaranteeing better access to natural resources for the Atikamekw, promoting the sharing of economic benefits and establish a formula for co-management of the territory.
Given the complexity and importance of the file, Minister Larouche has made it a priority. “Negotiations have never stopped since I took office. Bi-monthly meetings were held almost systematically. Two high-level political tables bringing together the three Atikamekw chiefs, the Minister of Natural Resources, Martine Ouellet, and myself, were also held to resolve the impasse surrounding certain contentious issues, ”said Minister Larouche.
The Government of Quebec has also taken concrete steps to demonstrate its good faith. Last May, Ministers Larouche and Ouellet agreed to implement urgent measures, thus granting a volume of wood and additional silvicultural work to preserve jobs in Atikamekw communities. Finally, last week, Minister Larouche presented the chiefs with an offer to try to reach a final agreement.
“Despite our best efforts, no mutually satisfactory solution has so far emerged from the negotiations. This is a complex issue and we must take the time necessary to find an innovative and acceptable outcome for both Parties. For the Government of Quebec, the solution lies in negotiation. », Concluded Ms. Larouche.
