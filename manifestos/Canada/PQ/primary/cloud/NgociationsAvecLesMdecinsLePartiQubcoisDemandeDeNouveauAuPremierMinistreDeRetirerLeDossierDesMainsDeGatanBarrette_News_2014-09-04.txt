Québec– The MNA for Taillon and spokesperson for the official opposition in matters of health and access to care, Diane Lamarre, and the MNA for Richelieu and spokesperson for the Conseil du trésor, Élaine Zakaïb, call again the Prime Minister to withdraw the dossier from the negotiations with the doctors from the hands of the Minister of Health and Social Services, Gaétan Barrette.
“This has been going on for months; Minister Barrette obviously cannot ignore his conflict of interest. He is a doctor who negotiated for the doctors and who is now negotiating on the other side of the table on behalf of the taxpayers. Add to that the $ 1.2 million bonus he pocketed for his work. The solution, from the start, was to give the file to another negotiator. We ask Philippe Couillard to use his common sense, to put an end to this conflict of interest situation and to let the President of the Treasury Board, Martin Coiteux, negotiate with the doctors, ”declared Élaine Zakaïb.
The Member for Richelieu recalls that with regard to the deadline he is giving himself to reach an agreement, Minister Barrette has already changed his speech several times. Today, it is the parliamentary re-entry which is invoked to justify its laxity. However, as this agreement will greatly influence Quebec&#39;s finances, it is imperative to conclude the negotiations quickly, according to her.
“Instead of alienating doctors with these negotiations, Minister Barrette should instead consider a plan to mobilize all medical staff, doctors included, to improve access to care, while providing for indicators of accountability. accounts, ”added Diane Lamarre.
“Minister Barrette&#39;s lack of credibility is damaging the entire government. It is not too late to restore the situation. Before passing a special law concerning an agreement that Dr. Barrette himself concluded in favor of physicians, Philippe Couillard must withdraw his mandate to negotiate with them, ”claimed Élaine Zakaïb.
