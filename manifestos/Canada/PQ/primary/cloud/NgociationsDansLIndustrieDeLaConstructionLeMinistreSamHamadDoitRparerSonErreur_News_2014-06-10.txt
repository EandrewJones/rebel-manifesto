Quebec– Sanguinet MP and Official Opposition Labor Critic Alain Therrien believes Labor Minister Sam Hamad is acting irresponsibly by threatening special legislation to impose conditions work in the construction industry, as negotiations continue.
“A negotiated agreement is always better than an imposed agreement. By his inappropriate comments at this point in the negotiations, the minister risks pushing us towards an imposed agreement. It breaks the balance of power between the bosses and the unions, while its role is precisely to maintain this balance in the world of work ”, declared Alain Therrien.
Remember that when the special law was tabled last year, the Parti Québécois proposed that it be in force for a period of four, then two years, to allow the dust to settle.
“Unfortunately, the Liberals and the Caquists ignored the expert advice and chose the deadline of June 30, 2014. Today, the minister must correct his mistake and put everything in place for a successful negotiation by the 22nd July, ”the spokesperson concluded.
