Quebec - The Minister of Labor, Employment and Social Solidarity and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Mrs. Agn√®s Maltais, sent this afternoon to the various parties a letter in which she asks them to resume, or to continue as the case may be, and stop using the media as a lever for negotiations.
You will find the letter attached.
Quebec, June 15, 2013 Alliance Syndicale Mr. Yves Ouellet Mr. Bernard Girard Mr. Jeannot Levasseur Mr. Sylvain Morissette
Quebec Construction Association (ACQ) Ms. Lyne Marcoux
Association of road and major works constructors of Quebec (ACRGTQ) Mr. Guy Duchesne
Provincial Association of Home Builders of Quebec (APCHQ) M. Dominique Robert Subject: Negotiations of collective agreements in the construction industry
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Negotiations for the renewal of the various collective agreements are at a turning point. The parties at one of the tables are said to have even stopped their work.
No need to remind you of the importance of the stakes and the fact that neither entrepreneurs, nor workers and even less the population want a labor dispute in this sensitive sector. The context has changed and open conflict is no longer a means of resolving disputes.
You have been chosen by your peers to carry out these negotiations. I would therefore remind you of your personal responsibility to do everything possible to reach a settlement which necessarily involves negotiation and therefore compromises.
I ask that the discussions at the tables resume or continue, as the case may be, and that you stop using the &quot;public square&quot; for interventions that are in any case unproductive in the eyes of citizens.
Counting on your prompt collaboration, please accept, Madam and Gentlemen, the expression of my distinguished feelings.
The Minister of Labor,
Original signed by
Agnes Maltais
