Quebec - The member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and president of the Parti Québécois caucus, Nicole Léger, is currently recovering from a successful mouth surgery last Friday.
Currently at rest, Nicole Léger was discharged from hospital yesterday and must cease her activities for three weeks. She wishes to reassure the population and indicate that her constituency office remains open; the staff will provide services to citizens. However, she will not be able to participate in the back-to-school caucus or the opening of the new parliamentary session. In his absence, Sylvain Pagé, the member for Labelle, spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of family, sports, recreation and healthy lifestyles, will chair the caucus.
“We are happy to hear that Nicole&#39;s intervention went well. We wish her a speedy recovery and hope that she will soon return to us in good shape to take up her new duties, with the enthusiasm and energy that we know her, ”said the leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau
