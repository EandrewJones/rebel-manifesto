Quebec - Quebec Premier Pauline Marois warmly congratulates Quebec author of Haitian origin, Dany Laferrière, on his election to the Académie française. He thus becomes the first Quebecer and the first Haitian to join this institution created in 1635 by Cardinal Richelieu.
“This prestigious election once again highlights the incredible talent of Quebec artists and their influence abroad. The work of Mr. Laferrière does honor to the French language. I am convinced that he will be able to make an exceptional contribution to the Académie française and make an original voice heard there, ”declared the Prime Minister.
“I feel a mixture of pride, admiration and recognition for what Dany Laferrière has just accomplished. Quebec literature and Haitian literature entered the Académie française with him. It is both his sensitivity, his passion for the imagination and his understanding of the universality of literature that will make him an extraordinary academician. This is great news for Quebec culture, ”said Maka Kotto.
Writer, journalist and columnist, Dany Laferrière grew up in the village of Petit-Goâve, Haiti. He immigrated to Quebec in 1976. Nine years later, his first novel, How to make love with a nigger without getting tired, made a successful entry into the Quebec literary landscape. He also made himself known and, above all, recognized in France and in the Francophonie.
Mr. Laferrière has received several career awards, including the Governor General&#39;s Award, in the French-language children&#39;s literature category, for his album Je suis fou de Vava; the Medici Prize and the Montreal Book Grand Prix for the Enigma of the Return. He was also crowned La Presse / Radio-Canada Personality of the Year 2009 and received the Blue Metropolis International Literary Grand Prize as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of Quebec at Rimouski. Last April, he also chaired, in Haiti, literary meetings between Haitian and Quebec writers.
