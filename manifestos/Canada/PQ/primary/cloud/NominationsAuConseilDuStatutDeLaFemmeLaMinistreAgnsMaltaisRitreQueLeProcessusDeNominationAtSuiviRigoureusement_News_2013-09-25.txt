Quebec - The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Ms. Agn√®s Maltais, reiterates that the government of Quebec has followed the appointment process very rigorously and that the composition of the Council for the Status of Women complies with the law.
Before being approved by the Council of Ministers, the nomination proposals went through a rigorous selection process. In fact, when the time comes to fill a seat, the circles concerned, those who have seats reserved for the Council under its Act, are consulted to obtain recommendations from people:
Four places were available on the board, three from women&#39;s associations and one from union organizations. In the process provided for by law, 19 associations were solicited and 16 proposals were received. Thus, the appointments recently approved by the Council of Ministers were made:
The rules for appointments to the Council for the Status of Women have therefore been scrupulously respected.
