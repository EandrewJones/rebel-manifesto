Quebec - The Minister of Natural Resources, responsible for northern development, Ms. Martine Ouellet, and the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Natural Resources (northern development component) and Member of Parliament for Ungava, Mr. Luc Ferland, announce the allocation of a special budget of $ 350,000 to the Société de développement de la Baie-James for the repair of four culverts on the James Bay road. This amount, combined with financial assistance from Hydro-Québec ($ 250,000), adds up to $ 600,000, the amount necessary for carrying out the work.
“The James Bay road is highly strategic for northern development. In addition to serving a population of 11,000 people, including several communities in the Cree Nation as well as the community of Radisson, it provides access to our large hydroelectric plants, ”said Luc Ferland.
The work announced will make the repairs permanent and ensure the stabilization of the structure. It should be remembered that the spring freshet caused major breaks in four culverts on the James Bay road (km 104 and 212), including the collapse of the roadway at km 212.
“The repair of the James Bay road is excellent news for the local populations. It will ensure the safety and efficiency of the road network, in addition to facilitating travel, for the current and future development of Northern Quebec, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
