Quebec, March 7, 2017 - “At a time when the print media are going through a very difficult period due to technological changes, Martin Coiteux is adding more and taking away from them an important source of revenue: public notices from municipalities. This is unacceptable, especially since it deprives citizens of a reliable and accessible source of information, ”lamented the Parti Québécois spokesperson for municipal affairs, Martin Ouellet, and regional development. , Sylvain Gaudreault.
“Written media are still those which reach the greatest number of citizens, particularly in regions and rural areas. In the future, citizens will have to look for information themselves on the websites of municipalities. Municipal public notices will become? Wanted notices? for citizens. There is no one today who has the instinct to go to the websites of municipalities. And, since the Internet is not a free service, we would now make citizens pay to have access to information concerning their living environment? This is insane! », Declared Martin Ouellet.
“In Bill 122, currently under study, the government allows municipalities to disseminate their public notices only on the Internet. Result? Overnight, a significant source of income for local media and an essential public service will disappear. By this decision alone, the Liberal government is financially compromising the maintenance of a considerable number of regional newsrooms, ”continued Sylvain Gaudreault.
“The amounts associated with the publication of public notices in newspapers, however, represent only 0.05% of municipal budgets. To properly inform citizens, it is very little. It is also a question of the presence and diversification of information in general in the regions of Quebec, ”concluded Martin Ouellet.
