Quebec - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for the environment and the fight against climate change, Sylvain Gaudreault, the natural resources spokesperson, Sylvain Rochon, and the member responsible for the Outaouais region, Stéphane Bergeron, denounce the fact that the federal government has neglected to consult Quebec on the choice of the Chalk River site for the establishment of a nuclear waste dump. They ask the Quebec government to hold a public consultation with the BAPE on this project.
IN SHORT
“The choice of this site, near the Ottawa River, involves real risks for public health and the environment. However, the Minister of the Environment does not even have an impact study to present to us. It is not true that Quebec must be satisfied with being a simple spectator. By not questioning the choice of the Chalk River site, the government of Quebec is abdicating against the federal government. The Minister must give the BAPE the mandate to hold a public consultation on this project, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
“The government admitted yesterday that it was preparing a contingency plan in the event of radioactive emissions, to be prepared if a disaster strikes. Otherwise, very little information has leaked so far about this project; most of what is available has been published in English by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. Let us remember that thanks to the Parti Québécois government, Quebec has chosen to phase out nuclear power; we therefore have the right to know all the risks associated with this landfill, ”demanded Sylvain Rochon.
“The site was chosen by a federal Crown corporation, without the approval of the Government of Quebec. However, it is for Quebec and Quebecers to decide whether a nuclear waste dump can be installed just one kilometer from the main source of drinking water for the city of Gatineau and many other localities in the region. &#39;Outaouais&#39;, concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
