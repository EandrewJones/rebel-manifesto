Montreal - The question of possible alliances between the Parti Québécois and other sovereignist and progressive forces has been the subject of discussions within the caucus and the team of Pauline Marois for several weeks.
In December, the leader of the Parti Québécois asked her team to assess more concretely the possible avenues of rapprochement and to carry out a detailed analysis of the advantages and disadvantages that this could entail.
This analysis is in progress and should help fuel the discussion.
Several members of the caucus interested in these questions were informed of the holding of this analysis and, through informal contacts, the interest of Pauline Marois in this question was communicated to Québec solidaire.
The objective of the process is to have the greatest number of sovereignist deputies in the National Assembly.
