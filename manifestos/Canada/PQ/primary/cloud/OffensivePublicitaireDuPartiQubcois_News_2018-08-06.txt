Montreal, August 6, 2018 - The President of the Parti Québécois, Gabrielle Lemieux, and the MP for Matane-Matapédia and spokesperson for the initiative, Pascal Bérubé, unveiled the Parti Québécois advertising offensive. Funny and irreverent, these advertisements will be broadcast in several regions of Quebec, as well as on the digital platforms of the Parti Québécois.
“While many are still on vacation, we wanted to challenge Quebeckers in a light and summery tone. I insist, however: through the jokes, there is a serious message. The priorities of Quebecers are serious! We have the best proposals to move Quebec forward; that too is serious! “, Argued Pascal Bérubé.
The Parti Québécois advertisements will be broadcast over the next few days on several radio stations, on the Internet as well as in the form of posters near highways. This will be the opportunity to send a strong message to Quebecers. “We know we have challenges, but we are up to speed and ready for the campaign. Our lucidity and our combativeness will give us the impetus we need. Do you find our campaign surprising? Expect you to be surprised again on October 1, ”concluded Parti Québécois President Gabrielle Lemieux.
