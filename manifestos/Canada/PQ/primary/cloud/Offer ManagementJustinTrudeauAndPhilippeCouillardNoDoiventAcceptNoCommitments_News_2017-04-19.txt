Quebec, April 19, 2017 - Reacting to the remarks of US President Donald Trump, who is attacking supply management in the dairy products sector, the Parti Québécois spokespersons for agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, and economics, Alain Therrien, ask Prime Ministers Trudeau and Couillard not to show any weakness in their defense of Quebec dairy farmers.
IN SHORT
“The Americans want to continue to exploit a loophole in Canadian customs control in order to steal market share from our producers. However, respecting the already existing rules is not a change in our trade! Supply management has been around longer than NAFTA, and that has not prevented its ratification or led to questioning of the agreement in the past. There is therefore no reason to compromise on this subject, especially when we know that American milk is heavily subsidized. Justin Trudeau and Philippe Couillard must maintain 100% supply management, ”said André Villeneuve.
“Let us remember that approximately 83,000 jobs depend on the dairy sector in Quebec. Philippe Couillard cannot remain passive. He must stand up to Justin Trudeau and ensure that Quebec&#39;s interests are taken into account in trade negotiations. For its part, the federal government must, for once, be uncompromising and affirm that we are not touching supply management. The slightest concession would be unacceptable. Justin Trudeau must make a choice: will he, yes or no, defend Quebec&#39;s milk producers? “Asked Alain Therrien.
