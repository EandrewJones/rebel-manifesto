Québec– The MNA for Berthier and Official Opposition critic for agriculture, fisheries and food, André Villeneuve, as well as the MNA for Verchères and spokesperson for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, urge the Liberal government to act to defend the interests of Quebec farmers in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will obviously sacrifice supply management.
“No one is fooled! Across Quebec, farmers are worried. They know that Canada is not playing fair, that it is ready to sacrifice them, that its priorities are far removed from theirs. They are mobilizing everywhere to defend supply management, which allows hundreds of Quebec SMEs to prosper and enrich our regions, ”said André Villeneuve.
For his part, Stéphane Bergeron added that in this matter, the duty of the Government of Quebec is not only to support local farmers and defend their interests, but also to ensure that Ottawa is equally committed. strongly in favor of maintaining supply management. “It is a priority for Quebec, and it is the duty of the Government of Quebec to ensure that it is also a priority for the federal government. We need guarantees from him. In the absence of such guarantees, the Quebec government will have to commit not to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership, ”he said.
&quot;The Minister of Agriculture may say that he is forging alliances with the Canadian provinces, it is not in Toronto that he should put pressure, it is in Ottawa!&quot; He must stop behaving like a beggar and, once and for all, ensure the respect of Quebec farmers, ”added the member for Berthier.
“A Quebec province is a Quebec subject to the leadership of the federal government. An independent Quebec would have its own voice to negotiate international treaties, particularly free trade, ”concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
