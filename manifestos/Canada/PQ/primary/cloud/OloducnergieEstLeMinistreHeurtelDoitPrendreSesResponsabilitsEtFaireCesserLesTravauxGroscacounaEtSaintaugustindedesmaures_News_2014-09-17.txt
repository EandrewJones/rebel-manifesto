Quebec– Sylvain Gaudreault, MP for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and the environment, and Bernard for Marie-Victorin and spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, once again urge the Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment and the Fight against Climate Change, David Heurtel, to assume his responsibilities and to put an end to the work of TransCanada in Gros-Cacouna and Saint-Augustin- de-Desmaures.
“Minister Heurtel issues authorizations individually, without waiting for the overall picture of the BAPE, which he promised, however, but which is still awaited. He chose to endanger the beluga nursery by authorizing the work in Gros-Cacouna. Worse yet, it relies totally on Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The only thing the Minister has done is promise that the work will stop when beluga whales pass, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
The member for Marie-Victorin recalled that the benefits of the project are far from convincing for Quebecers. “This pipeline project, in its current form, does not serve our interests at all. Quebec must not become a highway to get bituminous oil out of Alberta. The environmental risks, in addition to those related to safety, are disproportionate to the anticipated economic benefits, ”he argued.
“Through his responses, Minister Heurtel has clearly shown that he is incapable of ensuring that the ecological integrity of our territory is respected. He accepts without flinching that we are no longer masters of our sustainable development and that others make decisions for us, ”concluded the member for Jonquière.
