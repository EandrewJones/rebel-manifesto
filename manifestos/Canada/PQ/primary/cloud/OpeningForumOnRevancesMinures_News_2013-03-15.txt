Montreal - The Forum on mining royalties opens this morning at HEC Montreal. This important consultative exercise brings together representatives from the circles concerned by the issue of mining royalties around the same table.
“Today, we will be very attentive to the discussions that will take place. They will feed our thinking and our decisions on a new mining tax regime, ”said the Minister of Natural Resources, Martine Ouellet, and the Minister of Finance and the Economy, Nicolas Marceau from the outset.
The consultation paper The Quebec Mining Tax Regime, released last week, confirmed the government&#39;s intention to increase royalties. The government wants to improve the sharing of the wealth created and wants all businesses to contribute a minimum to this objective. Today&#39;s discussions will focus on how to achieve this, the different options offered and possible solutions.
“Ultimately, the government&#39;s goal is to put in place a mining regime ensuring that all Quebecers get their fair share and fully benefit from the value of the resources available on their territory. It must also make it possible to create a competitive and stable environment likely to attract new investments in Quebec ”, maintain the two ministers.
