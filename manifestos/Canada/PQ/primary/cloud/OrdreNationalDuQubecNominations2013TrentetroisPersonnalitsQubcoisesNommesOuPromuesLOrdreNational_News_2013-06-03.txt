Remember that every fall, a public call for candidates is launched on the Web and in the media. After evaluating the candidates, the Council of the National Order of Quebec recommends to the Premier the appointments for the year which are formalized by government decree. Founded in 1984, the Ordre national du Québec is the most prestigious recognition awarded by the Quebec government.
