Quebec - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, strongly denounces the 60% cuts imposed on the 16 organizations specializing in the development of the female workforce by the Minister of the Status of Women, Stéphanie Vallée.
“While the needs are growing, the budget of these organizations has gone from $ 1.2 million to $ 500,000. Is the minister aware of what her decision means? Does she know that thousands of vulnerable women, isolated or single parents, often struggling with financial problems, dependence or violence, have benefited from the support and specific approach of these organizations, which support them in their integration or their reintegration into the labor market? », Asked Carole Poirier.
&quot;After the cuts in home help, in programs promoting the access of women to decision-making positions, in homework help, after the postponement of the development of childcare places, the significant increase in service prices custody, and so on, a new measure is aimed directly at women. The austerity imposed by the Liberal government affects women more, especially women in the regions; moreover, this was recently confirmed by an IRIS study, ”the spokesperson continued.
Carole Poirier maintains that by acting in this way, the government is going squarely against the principles it claims to defend. “The Liberals are trying to lull people to sleep with their rhetoric, when in reality their actions undermine equal opportunities and job development, and help keep the most vulnerable women in poverty. I ask Minister Stéphanie Vallée to stand up and fight to maintain the budgets dedicated to organizations providing employment assistance for women, ”she demanded.
