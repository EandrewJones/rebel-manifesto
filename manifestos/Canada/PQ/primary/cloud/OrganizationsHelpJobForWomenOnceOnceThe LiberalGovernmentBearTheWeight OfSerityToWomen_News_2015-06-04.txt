Quebec - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, denounces the cuts that the Minister for the Status of Women, Stéphanie Vallée, is trying to impose on the 16 organizations which, throughout Quebec, are dedicated to the integration or reintegration of women into the labor market.
In the House this morning, the member asked the minister where the sum of $ 1.2 million had gone to fund organizations whose mission is to integrate women into the labor market, particularly the most disadvantaged women.
These organizations are present in 11 regions and support hundreds of women. Their unique expertise has been the subject of an in-depth study and was recognized in 2014 by the Ministry of Employment and Social Solidarity. However, yesterday, they indicated that they still had not received the sums that have been granted to them for 8 years and which allow them to support their particular mission with women.
“We are witnessing another liberal attack on women. This situation threatens regional economic development and causes the elimination of jobs and services aimed at women, especially young single mothers who wish to break the cycle of poverty. Once again, the Liberal government is putting the weight of austerity on women. This is absurd! », Denounced Carole Poirier.
The member deplores the minister&#39;s response even more, who simply said that organizations should make an effort and tighten their belts. “Once again, the Minister for the Status of Women has failed in her task; she did not know how to defend the women of Quebec. She has chosen to prioritize austerity, to the detriment of women&#39;s well-being and respect for economic rights. I have never seen this! », She concluded.
