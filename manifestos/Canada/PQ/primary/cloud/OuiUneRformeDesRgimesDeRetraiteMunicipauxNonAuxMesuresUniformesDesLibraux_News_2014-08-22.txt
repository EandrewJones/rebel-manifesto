Quebec - At the end of the first week of special consultations on Bill 3 on pension plans, the member for Sanguinet and official opposition spokesperson on this matter, Alain Therrien, once again invites the government to be open to improving the bill, in the best interests of taxpayers, workers, municipalities and retirees.
“Ensuring the sustainability and financial health of pension plans is a goal shared by all. The testimony heard this week allows us to better assess the impact of several aspects of the Liberal bill. The issue of fully funded plans is of particular concern to us, as is the situation of current retirees, ”said Alain Therrien.
The spokesperson recalls that the two main concerns that the Parti Québécois had remain, that is to say the unique solution proposed by the government and respect for signed conventions.
“The fact that Bill 3 affects all pension plans, regardless of their real situation, remains a concern. In addition, we must not lose sight of the negotiated collective agreements; it is important to respect them, to preserve the balance. This was also an objective that we had when we tabled Bill 79, which was a consensus, ”concluded the member for Sanguinet.
