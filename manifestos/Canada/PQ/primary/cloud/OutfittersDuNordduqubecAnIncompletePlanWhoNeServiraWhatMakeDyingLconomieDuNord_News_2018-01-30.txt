Québec, January 30, 2018 - Sylvain Roy, the member for Bonaventure and official opposition critic for forests, wildlife and parks, is dismayed by the announcement made today by the Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, Luc Blanchette. Indeed, the plan he presented puts the last nail in the coffin of wildlife development in Nord ‑ du ‑ Québec, suffocates an entire economic sector.
IN SHORT
&quot;Minister Blanchette affirms that he launched this morning a&quot; strategy for the vitality of northern heritage &quot;. However, the title is misleading: the majority of the sums announced will be devoted to the dismantling of the mobile hunting camps ”, underlined the spokesperson.
Indeed, there is no significant support to stimulate economic diversification in the region. “Once the camps are dismantled, there will be no further aid to develop the North, no source of viability for air transport. The countdown has started for the dismantling of the wildlife economy, ”he continued.
No action since August
Sylvain Roy recalls that the northern outfitters have nevertheless suggested several possible solutions to the Minister. “In December 2016, four days before Christmas, they learned of the closure of the caribou sport hunt, which put their industry in jeopardy. Far from being defeated, the outfitters did their homework: in August, through an interministerial committee, they proposed solutions to diversify the economy of the North. According to the members of the committee, these solutions deserved to be studied. But since then nothing has changed. Last fall, we called on the minister to take action. Still no reaction from Luc Blanchette. And today, six months later, it announces neither more nor less the end of access to Northern Quebec! ”, He summarized.
