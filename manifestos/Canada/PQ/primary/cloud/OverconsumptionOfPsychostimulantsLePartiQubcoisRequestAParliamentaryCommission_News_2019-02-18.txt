Quebec, February 18, 2019 - Sylvain Gaudreault, the member for Jonquière and spokesperson for the second opposition group in health matters, accompanied by pediatricians Jean-Benoît Bouchard, Guy Falardeau, Valérie Labbé and Pierre Claude Poulin, asked the Commission de la santé et des services sociaux (CSSS) to provide itself with a mandate of initiative so that its members can look into the overuse of drugs to regulate ADHD.
IN SHORT
“We know that since the turn of the 2000s, in Quebec, the consumption of drugs against attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the famous ADHD, has exploded. Why exactly? Why does psychological distress seem more marked among young Quebecers? Sylvain Gaudreault worries.
Sharing this concern, last January, nearly fifty pediatricians together sounded the alarm and denounced the too quick and too easy use of drugs to treat the symptoms of ADHD. Today, other pediatricians are joining this group and are proposing concrete solutions to reduce the overuse of psychostimulants: the establishment of a study committee bringing together the ministries of Health and Education, the improvement of psychosocial services, a reflection on assessment questionnaires and guidelines that define ADHD, as well as an increased offer of physical activity for young people, among others.
According to Sylvain Gaudreault, parliamentarians must imperatively look into the possible solutions put forward by these specialists. “We would like the members of the Commission to hear from experts in the field to take stock of this very worrying situation. The health and quality of life of our young people are at stake; this is also the reason why I am asking the other parties to support our request for the holding of this parliamentary commission, ”he demanded.
