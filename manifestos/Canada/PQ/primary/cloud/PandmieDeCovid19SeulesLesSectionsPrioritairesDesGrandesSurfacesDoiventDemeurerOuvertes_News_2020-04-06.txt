Québec, April 6, 2020 - In the collective interest, the Member for Matane-Matapédia and Parliamentary Leader of the Parti Québécois, Pascal Bérubé, as well as the Member for René-Lévesque and spokesperson for the economy and finance, Martin Ouellet, ask the government of Quebec to demand without delay the closure of non-priority sections of big box stores, that is to say of everything that does not concern the grocery store, the pharmacy or the hardware store.
IN SHORT
According to Pascal Bérubé, the message of Public Health has obviously not reached too many supermarkets. “Quebec is on hiatus until May 4; we must therefore all reduce our travel and activities to a minimum. However, some big-box stores allow their customers to shop for shirts, jewelry, video game consoles, etc. This deplorable situation generates unnecessary traffic there, unnecessarily putting the health of employees and customers who have come to purchase essential goods at risk. For the good of all of us, it must stop immediately, ”he demanded.
“At the start of the crisis, the decision to leave big-box stores completely open was understandable: we had to allow everyone to get what they needed to start the confinement period and comply with the instructions. But the time has now come to revise the list of priority services to adapt it to the reality of this protracted crisis, ”added the parliamentary leader.
What is more, believes Martin Ouellet, it is a form of unfair competition for SMEs which sell these same non-priority goods and which, for their part, must remain closed. “Our entrepreneurs should not be punished any more! In their interest, it is time to force supermarkets to close non-priority sections now. The goods will remain available online; consumers will therefore not be deprived of it. It is a question of justice and equity as much as of public health, ”summed up the member for René-Lévesque.
