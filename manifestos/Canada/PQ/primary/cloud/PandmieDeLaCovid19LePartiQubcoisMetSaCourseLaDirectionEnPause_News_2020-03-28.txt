Montreal, March 28, 2020 - To follow up on the government&#39;s request to put Quebec on hiatus and given the state of emergency declared by the City of Montreal, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the conference coordination of the Parti Québécois made the decision to take a break in his leadership race.
“During the re-evaluation of the rules of the race on March 20, we made a commitment to act on the new developments. Today, it is our duty to lead by example and to respect the government&#39;s request: to put Quebec, as well as all non-essential activities, on hiatus. Faced with the unprecedented pandemic facing Quebec, all our energies must be devoted to resolving this crisis, ”said Agnès Maltais, returning president of the Parti Québécois.
Therefore, as of today, the reception of signatures related to the leadership race is suspended. The suspension of donations will be effective from Monday March 30. The coordinating conference will reconvene within a maximum of 30 days to assess the possibility of reopening the nomination period. Following the resumption, candidates will be given a period of 21 days to complete the collection of their signatures.
It should also be noted that with the exception of the date of the end of the nomination period, the calendar adopted on March 20 by the coordination conference remains, for the moment, unchanged.
