Quebec, April 21, 2020 - The deputy for Îles-de-la-Madeleine and Parti Québécois transport spokesperson, Joël Arseneau, wants the Quebec government to quickly offer compensation to another category of essential workers: truckers.
IN SHORT
“Truckers already have a number of heavy financial burdens on their shoulders: skyrocketing insurance, registration, vehicle maintenance, and so on. In addition, not only do they have to get to their destination - with all the risks that this entails, given that they come into contact with many people - but they also have to handle loads, to take care of the paperwork. , to assume the additional costs related to their basic needs, in particular the safety equipment which they must now obtain. They experience anxiety, fearful of putting loved ones at risk or running out of cash. The time has come to offer them real support, ”said the member for Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
To support truckers, the Parti Québécois wants the Quebec government to put in place:
For Joël Arseneau, the government must seize this opportunity to promote the profession of truck driver. “This sector of the economy is also facing a labor shortage; difficult working conditions and heavy financial burdens do not attract the next generation. However, truckers do essential work for our supply chain. We can not do without. As elected officials, we have a responsibility to support workers in all essential services, and freight transport is definitely part of that, ”he concluded.
