Quebec - The Regulation respecting the target benefit pension plans of certain companies in the pulp and paper sector is published in the Gazette officielle du Québec. It will come into effect in two weeks, on November 21, 2013.
The Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity and Minister responsible for the Régie des rentes du Québec, Ms. Agnès Maltais, explained that &quot;the publication of this regulation constitutes the last government obligation necessary for the payment of part of the reductions in pensions, suffered by unionized retirees of White Birch Papers ”. The minister now wants the company to get to work without delay for the benefit of retirees.
The government has acted swiftly on this matter so that the new pension plans for White Birch Papers employees are registered. According to the agreement between the union and the company, the registration of the plans will allow the reinstatement of part of the pension of retirees, retroactively.
“Today, we are taking an important step in this sad issue that has gone on for too long. We have been there for the workers and retirees of the White Birch Papers factories since we took office and we continue to put all the pressure to have their pensions restored, ”added the Minister.
The regulation in question establishes the rules for the operation of the Target Benefit Pension Plans (CHRS) of White Birch Papers. It also applies to Resolute Forest Products plans. It follows up on the Act to allow the establishment of target benefit pension plans in certain companies in the pulp and paper sector (adopted on December 6, 2012) as well as the agreements concluded between these companies and their respective unions.
These CHRS are retroactive to January 1, 2011 for Resolute Forest Products and since September 13, 2012, for White Birch Papers.
