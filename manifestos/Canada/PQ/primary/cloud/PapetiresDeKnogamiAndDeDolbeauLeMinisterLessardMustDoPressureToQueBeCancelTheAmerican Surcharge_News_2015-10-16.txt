Quebec - The deputy for Bonaventure and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on forests, Sylvain Roy, urges the Minister of Forests, Laurent Lessard, to put pressure on the federal government to negotiate the cancellation of the surtax imposed on the export of supercalendered paper from the Kénogami and Dolbeau factories.
“This surtax is a real blow to the workers at the Dolbeau and Kénogami paper mills, as it is for the entire forestry economy in Quebec. The Minister of Forests must assume his responsibilities and ask Ottawa to cancel this surtax which threatens forest communities in Quebec. More than 300 direct jobs are affected by this American measure, in addition to indirect jobs linked to the two factories, ”said Sylvain Roy.
No good omen
The member for Bonaventure further fears that if the Canadian government does not negotiate a new agreement quickly, this decision by the US Department of Commerce is only a prelude to a new softwood lumber war.
“The Americans are now attacking supercalendered paper from Quebec, but they could soon attack softwood lumber, if a new agreement is not negotiated in the short term. Minister Lessard must defend the Quebec forestry regime with the federal government, in order to avoid a new conflict that could close the American market to Quebec exporters and, thus, cause several hundred job losses in the regions of Quebec ”, concluded Sylvain Roy.
