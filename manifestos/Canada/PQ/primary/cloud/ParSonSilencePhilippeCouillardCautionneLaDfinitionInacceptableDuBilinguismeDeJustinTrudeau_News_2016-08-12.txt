Quebec - Following statements by the federal Minister of Justice regarding the supposed bilingualism required for the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court, the member for Joliette and the Parti Québécois justice spokesperson, Véronique Hivon, as well as that the member for Verchères and spokesperson for Quebec-Canada relations, Stéphane Bergeron, denounced the complete silence of the Liberal government regarding the new definition of bilingualism given by Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.
“The Trudeau government&#39;s announcement was obviously window dressing. The minister&#39;s definition of bilingualism is unacceptable, especially since it highlights a total incomprehension of Quebec and of the French fact. Does the Premier of Quebec agree with such a definition? What, in his opinion, is the requirement that we should have for Supreme Court justices? », Asked Véronique Hivon.
“We are once again seeing that despite the rhetoric, Justin Trudeau&#39;s federal government does not understand Quebec. Another promise goes up in smoke, in the total indifference of the Liberal government of Quebec and its Minister responsible for Canadian Relations and La Francophonie, Jean-Marc Fournier, ”added Stéphane Bergeron.
