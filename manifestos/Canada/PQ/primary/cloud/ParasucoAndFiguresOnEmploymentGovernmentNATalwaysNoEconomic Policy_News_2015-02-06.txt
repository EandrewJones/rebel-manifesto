Québec– Pierre Karl Péladeau, MP for Saint-Jérôme and official opposition spokesperson for the economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, as well as the MP for Saint-Jean and spokesperson in terms of employment, Dave Turcotte, deplored the closure of the shops of Parasuco, a Quebec company, and, as a result, the loss of dozens of jobs.
“After Jacob, Mexx and Smart Set, Parasuco today announced the closure of its 6 stores in Quebec, forcing its workers to find new jobs. The government must realize, finally, that its &quot;liberal effect&quot; is not working; people continue to lose their jobs in Quebec, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
The member for Saint-Jérôme wonders if the government of Philippe Couillard realizes that its carelessness is undermining the financial health of families in Quebec. “The government&#39;s all-out cuts, combined with massive job losses since coming to power, are causing Quebec families to suffer; there are fewer services, fewer jobs, more taxes and more taxes, but the Liberals, alone in their bubble, find that all is well. Let them wake up! &quot;, he added.
“The Liberals keep saying that the June 2014 budget is their jobs plan. However, tax increases and cuts in services can in no way be considered as an employment development plan, ”continued the member for Saint-Jérôme.
More full-time job losses
The figures released this morning by Statistics Canada show that Quebec has lost other full-time jobs, lamented Dave Turcotte. He therefore asks the government to unveil its employment plan. “Quebec lost another 4,400 full-time jobs in January; what are the Liberals doing to stop this bleeding? He wondered.
&quot;The government must ensure that the workers of Parasuco and the 4,400 Quebecers who lost their full-time job in January will find one&quot;, declared the member for Saint-Jean, adding that &quot;accompanying measures must also be implemented by Emploi-Québec ”.
