Quebec - Contrary to what Prime Minister Philippe Couillard asserts, the new Council of Ministers, unveiled with great fanfare yesterday, does not make more room for women, believes the Parti Québécois spokesperson on the status of women and MP d&#39;Hochelaga? Maisonneuve, Carole Poirier.
First, Ms. Poirier insisted that no matter how many women step into the Cabinet, if the government continues to move forward with its austerity measures, women will not get any. profit. “For the Prime Minister, gender parity is just a slogan, a cosmetic measure. In fact, women are the first victims of liberal austerity. For example, when we cut childcare centers and employment assistance programs intended for women to favor infrastructure projects, which are mainly aimed at men, the cause of women recedes, it is undeniable. », She declared at the outset.
Moreover, the exercise conducted yesterday by the Prime Minister is not conclusive in terms of parity. “If we look closely, we see that the budgets of the ministries entrusted to women represent only 5% of the total budget of the Quebec state. In comparison, last week again, women managed 9% of Quebec&#39;s budget, according to the Council on the Status of Women, which was already not famous. In reality, therefore, the new Couillard government is a symbol of regression in terms of the representation of women in politics, ”continued the spokesperson.
“Obviously, the appointment of a woman at the head of the Ministry of the Economy is something to be welcomed, but it is in no way a significant budgetary item,” added the MP. All the big ministries are still headed by men. Health, Education, Family, for example, remain 100% male fields. &quot;
