Quebec - You will find attached a joint statement read this morning by the member for Champlain, Ms. Noëlla Champagne, and the member for Saint-Maurice, Mr. Luc Trudel, concerning the impossibility for government members to continue the work within the framework of the mandate to study the impacts related to the decommissioning of the Gentilly-2 nuclear power plant and the economic diversification plan for the Center-du-Québec and Mauritius sectors, during the working session of the Committee on Agriculture , fisheries and natural resources (CAPERN).
To members of the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries, Energy and Natural Resources (CAPERN)
“Considering that the parliamentary committee held on January 29 and 30 on the study of the impacts related to the decommissioning of the Gentilly-2 nuclear power plant and the economic diversification plan for the sectors of Center-du-Québec and Mauricie allowed the various stakeholders to express themselves freely;
“Considering that the sometimes strong discussions have nevertheless enabled the Minister of Natural Resources and the Government of Quebec to fully understand the impacts associated with such a downgrading;
“Considering that a report drawn up by parliamentarians from different political parties obviously seems doomed to deep disagreement;
“Considering that the working session of February 20, demonstrated beyond any doubt the incompatibility of understanding on the substance of things;
“Considering that aggressiveness and shocking remarks made during this working session undermined the smooth running of the meeting and put an end to the elementary bond of respect between parliamentarians;
“Considering that such an atmosphere is in no way conducive to the drafting of a report devoid of all partisanship;
“The members of the parliamentary committee representing the government cannot continue to discuss this report under these conditions.
“Consequently, there is no consent to continue the discussions in order to produce a report to the National Assembly beyond the date proposed in the mandate, namely February 21, 2013.
