Quebec - The MP for Vachon and official opposition critic for mines and shale gas, Martine Ouellet, believes that it would be an aberration for the government of Quebec to consider participating financially in the gas industry in Quebec. shale in the current state of things.
“Before thinking about investing, it would still be necessary to have popular support. We are far from the mark: the social consensus is not there. What we currently need is a moratorium, nothing else, ”said Martine Ouellet.
She is surprised that the Liberal government is opening the door so quickly to this idea launched last week by the industry. “The Liberals say over and over again that it is not for the state to take risks. Investing in shale gas is a huge risk since this industry is going from bad to worse. The risks are as much environmental, social as economic. In short, we are far from the principles of sustainable development and what we see with this rapid openness expressed by Premier Charest is that the government is more at the service of industry than at the service of the population ” , she concluded.
