Saint-Constant - The president of the Parti Québécois de La Prairie, Marcelle Caron, denounces François Rebello&#39;s double speech. &quot;Just before the holidays, François told us that he would stay in the Parti Québécois and that he did not want to know anything about the CAQ. By joining François Legault’s party, he made a false leap to activists and voters who voted for him with confidence ”.
In addition, Marcelle Caron judges that François Rebello seems to have acted out of opportunism, abandoning all his convictions. “He says he remains sovereignist, but he is going to the most flattering party in front of the federal government. He says he has values and convictions, but will join MPs who think the opposite of what he has always proposed. All that has guided him is the thirst for power in the very short term within a new business party ”.
The activists remain taken aback and disappointed.
