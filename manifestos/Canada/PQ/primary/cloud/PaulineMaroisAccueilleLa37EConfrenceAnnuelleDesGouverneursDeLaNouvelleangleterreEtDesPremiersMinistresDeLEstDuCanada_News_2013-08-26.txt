Quebec - Quebec Premier Pauline Marois will welcome her counterparts from the Atlantic Provinces and the New England States to the 37th Annual Conference of New England Governors and Premiers of Eastern Canada, September 8 and 9 in La Malbaie. She will co-chair the deliberations of this meeting along with the Governor of Rhode Island, Lincoln D. Chafee.
The Conference will be an opportunity for heads of government to address common issues such as the energy future, regional initiatives promoting the use of fuel-efficient vehicles and adaptation to climate change, both from the perspective of protection environment than that of mutual aid in an emergency. The meeting will also help to promote consensus building aimed at greater integration of the actions of the various governments in these matters.
