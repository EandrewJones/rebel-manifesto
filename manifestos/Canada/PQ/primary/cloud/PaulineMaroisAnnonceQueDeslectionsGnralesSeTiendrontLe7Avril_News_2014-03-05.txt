Quebec - Premier of Quebec and leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has announced that a general election will be held on April 7.
“Since our government was elected 18 months ago, we have accomplished a lot. We took action against corruption and regained control of government spending for the first time in 10 years. We have taken care of our world, while very actively supporting the Quebec economy. Our policies are ambitious for Quebec. Today, it is time to give ourselves the means to go even further, ”said Pauline Marois.
“Over the past few years, I have brought together some great men and women. With the new candidates that I will present to you in the coming days, our already very solid team will be one of the strongest we have seen in a long time. We have proven ourselves. We were not afraid to make difficult decisions, but necessary ones. We have a plan and the team to succeed, ”added the Premier.
“We are faced with two parties who want to prevent us from moving forward,” she continued. We tabled a responsible budget, but they decided to oppose it even before reading it. By doing so, it is not only the government, but all of Quebec that the opposition parties are holding back. &quot;
“So I convened the Council of Ministers and we made arrangements to dissolve the National Assembly and call general elections. It will now be up to you, Quebeckers, to decide. You know my team, which is very strong. And you know me: I am not afraid to fully assume my responsibilities as head of government. Everything is in place. All we need is to have the means to act. What I am asking you is to give us these means. We have the plan. We have the team. We have the determination. My team is determined. I am determined, ”concluded the Premier.
