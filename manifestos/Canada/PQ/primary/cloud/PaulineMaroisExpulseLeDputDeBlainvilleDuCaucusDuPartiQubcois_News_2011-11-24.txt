Quebec - The MP for Charlevoix and leader of the official opposition, Pauline Marois, expels the MP for Blainville, Daniel Ratthé, from the Parti Québécois caucus.
“After a brief meeting with him, I came to the conclusion that I cannot trust an MP who denies his beliefs out of opportunism. Out of respect for the members of the caucus and for the activists, I cannot accept that a deputy remains within our political formation while he considers joining the Coalition Avenir Québec. The Parti Québécois is a large political formation bringing together activists for whom convictions take precedence over polls. We have big plans for Quebec and we must count on people who have the courage to defend their ideas, ”said Pauline Marois.
