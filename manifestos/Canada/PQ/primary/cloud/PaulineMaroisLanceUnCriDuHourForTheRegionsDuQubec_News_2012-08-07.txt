Sainte-Anne-des-Monts– The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, launched a real cry from the heart for the regions of Quebec. “Our territory is immense and without its regions, Quebec would not be what it is. It is our duty as Quebecers to help each other from one region to another, ”pleaded Pauline Marois.
The Parti Québécois is proposing concrete measures to revive the regions: the creation of the Banque de développement économique du Québec to support regional entrepreneurs and the establishment of a government action group for the Gaspé, chaired by Pauline Marois.
“The people of the Gaspé are very attached to their part of the country and they do everything they can to keep their communities and their villages alive. Regions like the Gaspé have their own realities and must take up specific challenges. We are in the poorest MRC in Quebec. I am very touched by the people I have met here. We must listen to them and support them! Exclaimed the leader of the Parti Québécois.
Pauline Marois also recalled that, unlike other political parties, the Parti Québécois makes regional development a real priority. “I feel a great indifference from the other parties towards the regions. The only thing Jean Charest does for the Gaspésiens is to offer them jobs in the North. As for François Legault, it is radio silence on the regions of Quebec. For the Liberals and the Caquists, it is as if the people of the regions did not exist, ”continued Pauline Marois.
“I guarantee you that a Parti Québécois government will take care of all the regions of Quebec because it is the duty of a Prime Minister to take care of all Quebecers. All of Quebec must help each other! », Concluded the leader of the Parti Québécois.
