Quebec - Quebec Premier Pauline Marois made a point of addressing family members of former Alberta premier Ralph Klein. “I am well aware of the sacrifices that must be made by those close to public figures. To Mr. Klein&#39;s wife, his children and his many grandchildren, who had to share this beloved man with their community, I offer my deepest condolences, ”said Ms. Marois.
The Premier also expressed her deep sympathy to the citizens of Alberta, who learned yesterday of the death of their twelfth premier. “Ralph Klein has devoted 26 years of his life to politics, including 14 years as head of the state of Alberta. You cannot experience such longevity in this function without maintaining a special relationship with the people of your community, ”she added.
Obviously, Ralph Klein&#39;s action was decisive in the history of Alberta. “There is no denying that his influence on Alberta politics will be felt for a long time to come. Ralph Klein will be remembered for his outspokenness, of course, but above all for his exceptional commitment to the citizens of Alberta. Let us hope that his memory will inspire his successors, ”concluded Pauline Marois.
