Montreal - Following the death of Eric Gourdeau, the Member of Parliament for Charlevoix and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pauline Marois, paid tribute to him and offered his condolences to his family and loved ones.
“Éric Gourdeau has been a great servant of the Quebec nation. Having worked with René Lévesque, in particular on the nationalization of electricity, his career perfectly embodies the heroic era of the construction of the State of Quebec. Collectively, we owe a lot to this group of daring, sharp-minded young people who built our institutions, ”said Pauline Marois.
The leader of the official opposition also recalled that Eric Gourdeau&#39;s contribution was not limited to the time of the Quiet Revolution. “He has dedicated his life to building bridges to Indigenous communities, to remembering that the North of Quebec, to which more and more people are turning, should not be developed to the detriment of the people who inhabit it, but rather partnership with them. &quot;
Éric Gourdeau also directed the Fondation de la Maison René-Lévesque, whose objective is to set up a museum in honor of the former premier in New Carlisle in the Gaspé. “Until the end of his life, he devoted himself to promoting Quebec&#39;s history and reminding us of our duty to remember our builders,” concluded Pauline Marois.
