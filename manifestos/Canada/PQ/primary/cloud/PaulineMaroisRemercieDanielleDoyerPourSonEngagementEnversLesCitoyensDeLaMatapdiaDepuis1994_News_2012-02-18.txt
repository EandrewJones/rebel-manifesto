“Montreal, February 17, 2012
Mrs. Danielle Doyer Member of Parliament for Matapédia 1506, boul. Jacques-Cartier Office 02 Mont-Joli (Quebec) G5H 2V4
Dear Colleague,
It is with regret that I learn of your decision not to seek a new mandate in the riding of Matapedia that you have represented so well since 1994. I would like to sincerely thank you for your commitment over all these years.
You are an early activist for the sovereignty of Quebec and you have been able to defend with energy and relentlessly the citizens of Matapedia for 18 years in the National Assembly. You never missed an opportunity to call on the appropriate government bodies, in power as in the opposition, to stimulate the economy of your riding and of the Bas-Saint-Laurent, which has experienced its share of difficulties, particularly in the sector. forest.
I saw you at work with intensity and courage, with and for your fellow citizens, both in the National Assembly and within our caucus. In the performance of your duties, you have defended with conviction and passion people grappling with various problems, workers and community organizations.
I know that the decision you announced today follows a long reflection and that it was not easy to take. I respect your choice and I want to assure you that you will be sorely missed by your colleagues in the National Assembly and the activists and citizens of Matapedia. Until the next election date, I am sure you will continue to give your best.
I want to sincerely thank you for what you have done for so many years and I thank you in advance for the commitment you make to continue your militant action to make Quebec a country.
Original signed
PAULINE MAROIS &quot;
