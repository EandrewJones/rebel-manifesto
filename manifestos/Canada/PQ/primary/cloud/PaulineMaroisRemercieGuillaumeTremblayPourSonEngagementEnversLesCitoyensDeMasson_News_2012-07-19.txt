Quebec - The leader of the official opposition and MP for Charlevoix, Pauline Marois, commented on the decision of the MP for Masson, Guillaume Tremblay, who chooses not to be a candidate in the next general election.
“I would like to thank Guillaume Tremblay for all the work he has accomplished over the past four years. I saw Guillaume invest himself with conviction, ardor and energy for the citizens of Masson and help improve their quality of life, ”said Pauline Marois.
“I respect, understand and salute Guillaume&#39;s decision. When you seek the confidence of citizens for a mandate, you have to make sure you can complete it. At a time when the ambient political cynicism is reaching an unparalleled level, it is to its credit to make this choice which is hers today, ”she added.
“On behalf of all the deputies of the parliamentary wing and on behalf of the members of the Parti Québécois, thank you Guillaume for your commitment to continue your militant action to make Quebec a country. I wish you the best of luck in your future projects, ”concluded Pauline Marois.
