Quebec - The MP for Charlevoix and leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, is surprised at the decision of the MP for La Prairie, François Rebello, to leave his political party to join the ranks of the Coalition Avenir Québec.
&quot;Barely a few weeks ago, Mr. Rebello personally assured me that he was in the Parti Québécois to stay there and that his sovereignist convictions prevailed above all,&quot; said Pauline Marois, recalling that he had even confronted a minister during the question period of December 9, 2011 by asserting to him to have convictions, him.
Pauline Marois said she was deeply disappointed with the departure of the member for La Prairie who chose to join a party that has given up on making Quebec a country. “François Rebello acts out of pure opportunism. In politics, frankness always has its place and lies never pay, ”concluded the leader, wondering how Mr. Rebello will now be able to combine his convictions with those of federalists who have given up on defending Quebec.
