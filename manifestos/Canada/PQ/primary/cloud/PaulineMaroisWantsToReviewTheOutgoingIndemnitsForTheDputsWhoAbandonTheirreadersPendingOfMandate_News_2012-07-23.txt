Lévis - The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, wants to review the severance pay received by members who do not complete the mandate for which they have obtained the confidence of their constituents.
“When you choose to run as a candidate in an election, you do so with the desire to serve your citizens, to devote yourself to them. To abandon them along the way, for very often questionable reasons, is not to do justice to his commitment. We must therefore establish the following principle: an elected representative who abandons the mandate that his fellow citizens have entrusted to him will not receive any compensation, ”said Pauline Marois. The possibility of penalties being imposed on the pension scheme in the event of departure during a term of office should also be examined.
“This is no longer the time to say: &#39;This is always how it was done&#39;. We must listen to Quebeckers and change, ”added the leader of the Parti Québécois, stressing that taxpayers find it inconceivable that bonuses of several thousand dollars be paid to ministers or deputies who resign four or six months after a general election. For example, she recalled the agreement between chef Jean Charest and former minister Monique Jérôme-Forget. The latter left in April 2009, just four months after being elected.
Each resignation represents a huge cost for Quebec taxpayers because it leads to the holding of a by-election. Since the last general election in December 2008, the cost of holding nine by-elections is estimated to be between $ 4.5 million and $ 5 million.
To make such a shift, a legislative amendment to the Act respecting the National Assembly is necessary. “It is a tradition for this kind of change to be done unanimously by the parties. I therefore urge the leaders of all the other political parties to speak out on this principle now, ”concluded Pauline Marois.
