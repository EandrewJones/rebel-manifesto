Quebec - The member for Saint-Jérôme and leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, once again called on the government about the relocation of people staying at the Pavillon Sainte-Marie, in the riding of Saint-Jérôme. On March 2, the 63 severely disabled people who live there learned that they would be torn from their living environment and moved within 15 days.
“These people have lived at Pavillon Sainte-Marie for 10, 15, even 20 years. The professionals, nurses and attendants who take care of them on a daily basis have in a way become a second family for them. Thanks to the mobilization of the families of the people lodged and the users&#39; committee, the move was postponed until April 15. But a question remains: why is this move done in haste, a haste akin to indignity? “Asked Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“The Pavilion is certainly obsolete, hence the desire of all governments over the past three years to provide severely disabled people who live there with a living environment that is better suited to their needs. However, with very short notice, the government is now preparing to destabilize and weaken people who are already excessively vulnerable. The Prime Minister must commit to postponing this decision which, obviously, is greatly precipitated, ”concluded the member for Saint-Jérôme.
