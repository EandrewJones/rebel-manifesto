Quebec - The member for Marie-Victorin and official opposition critic for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, condemns the government for allowing the return of bonuses to executives and senior executives of Hydro- Quebec; he recalled that during this time, in addition to being overcharged by the Crown corporation, taxpayers see their taxes increased and the services offered to them reduced.
&quot;If we take into account the $ 67 million in metering fees improperly billed to customers with a smart meter, the abusive interest rates of 14.4% that the state monopoly imposes on consumers, the payment of a princely annuity of more than $ 450,000, indexed annually, to ex-CEO Thierry Vandal, or even hundreds of millions of dollars unnecessarily spent in the erratic management of the closure of the Gentilly II nuclear power plant, it is obvious that the Senior Hydro-Québec executives do not deserve to be rewarded, while Quebecers are seeing their electricity bills increase because of all these bad decisions, ”said Bernard Drainville.
The deputy recalls that since 2010, provisions had forced the heads of state-owned companies to make an effort comparable to that of the rest of the public sector for the period of return to balanced budgets; however, Bill 28, adopted under gag order by the Liberal government, removed these constraints, allowing the return of bonuses to senior executives.
“The Parti Québécois voted against; It was therefore by gag order that the Liberal government brought back the performance bonuses. The practice is all the more scandalous as these premiums are totally unjustified. Besides, isn&#39;t it the Minister of Natural Resources, Pierre Arcand, who admitted last week that Quebeckers had less money in their pockets since the Liberals were elected? In this context, how can the government allow Hydro-Québec to pay bonuses, financed by Quebecers, to its senior executives? It&#39;s up to him, it&#39;s his duty to put an end to it, ”concluded Bernard Drainville.
