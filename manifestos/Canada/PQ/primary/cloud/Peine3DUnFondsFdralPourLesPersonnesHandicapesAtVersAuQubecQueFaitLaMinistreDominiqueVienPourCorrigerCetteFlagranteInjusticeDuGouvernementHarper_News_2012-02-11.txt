Quebec - Émilien Pelletier, MP for Saint-Hyacinthe and official opposition spokesperson for people with disabilities, protested that less than 3% of the federal government&#39;s Accessibility Fund has been used by people with disabilities in Quebec since 2008.
“It is appalling to see the Conservative government let down disabled people and Quebec rights organizations in this way. The needs are just as great in Quebec as elsewhere. Why has the Minister for Social Services, Dominique Vien, done nothing to correct this injustice? Currently, people with disabilities are paying the price for this nonchalance ”, strongly deplored Emilien Pelletier.
The member seriously wonders about the distribution of this fund when he learns that of the $ 67 million available, 85% of the sums were paid into ridings represented by Conservative members. &quot;It is totally indecent to see how much the federal government of Stephen Harper is playing partisanship on the backs of people with disabilities,&quot; he added.
The Parti Québécois emphasizes that people with disabilities and rights groups have dire needs. “People with disabilities in Quebec also have the right to receive their fair share of federal funds. It is high time that Minister Vien intervened so that this federal envelope was managed in Quebec. We must make the daily life of our people with disabilities who face serious accessibility problems easier, ”concluded Émilien Pelletier.
