Quebec - The member for Saint-Hyacinthe and official opposition spokesperson for people with disabilities, Émilien Pelletier, is concerned about the data reported by the Regroupement des activistes pour l&#39;Inclusion au Québec (RAPLIQ) which estimates at 60% the number of public places inaccessible to people with reduced mobility.
“It is completely unthinkable that in 2011 so many public places are not accessible to people with reduced mobility. Each time a disabled person is removed from these public places, it becomes discriminatory and we cannot let things go that way, ”said Emilien Pelletier.
The official opposition spokesperson for people with disabilities recalls that the release of RAPLIQ is part of the same process as his when, on June 9, he questioned Minister Vien on this subject in the National Assembly. “The problems experienced by people with disabilities are far from trivial. In this case, a 72-year-old woman from Granby with severe osteoporosis could not safely access her medical clinic, as it was not adapted for people with reduced mobility. This is unacceptable! », Indignant the deputy.
“True to form, Minister Vien contented herself with answering the question vaguely without really considering the case of this lady. The time has come to move from words to deeds and to allow real accessibility to public places for people with disabilities. The social exclusion of people with disabilities is unacceptable regardless of the form and I ask the Minister to take seriously all interventions by organizations defending the rights of these people, ”concluded MP Émilien Pelletier.
