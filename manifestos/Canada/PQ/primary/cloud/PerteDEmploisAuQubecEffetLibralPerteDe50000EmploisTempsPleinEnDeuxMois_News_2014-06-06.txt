Quebec - In light of the employment figures in Quebec, released today, the member for Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth , Dave Turcotte, and the member for Saint-Jérôme and spokesperson for the economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, note that the alleged liberal effect on the Quebec economy means the loss of nearly 50,000 full-time jobs in two months. The published statistics also indicate an increase in the unemployment rate of 0.4%, which takes it from 7.6 to 8%.
“After Quebec lost 32,000 jobs in April, the Liberal effect led to the loss of 800 jobs in May. This stagnation in employment hides the loss of 26,700 full-time jobs in the last month. The record since the PLQ came to power is hardly glowing. Obviously, we are seeing that the Liberal promises of job creation are not materializing, ”said Dave Turcotte.
“Will the Liberals apply the same way they did when we were in government, that is, hold themselves accountable for the monthly job creation figures? Finally, the Liberal effect means fewer jobs and less economic growth, ”said the member for Saint-Jean.
The Liberal budget includes a general 20% reduction in tax credits for several sectors of the economy. The business community is worried about these improvised cuts, made without any consultation.
“The Liberals are cutting and will then think through their review commission on Quebec taxation. In addition, the Liberal budget plan contains no clear vision on economic development. There are no structuring actions. I would remind you that the government has abandoned the measures included in the Economic Policy Priority Emploided by the Parti Québécois, a policy that has nevertheless been hailed by the business community ”, for his part affirmed Pierre Karl Péladeau.
