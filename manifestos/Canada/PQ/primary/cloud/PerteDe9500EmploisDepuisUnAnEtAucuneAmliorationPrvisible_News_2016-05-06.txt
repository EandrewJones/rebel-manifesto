Quebec - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for finances and revenue, Nicolas Marceau, the spokesperson for the economy, energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, as well as the spokesperson for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, recalled that the long-term trend is increasingly worrying with regard to employment in Quebec.
“From April 2015 to April 2016, 9,500 jobs were lost in Quebec. All the economic indicators are on the decline, so many signals that should make the government react. On the contrary, Minister Anglade presented us with disparate strategic plans, without vision and without means. After two years of inaction, the Prime Minister finally recognizes the need to bring together all socio-economic partners around the design of a real economic policy to create jobs. He must convene this meeting as quickly as possible, ”demanded the member for Rousseau.
“According to Desjardins, by 2018, Quebec will have created 121,000 jobs, or half of the 250,000 that the Liberal government had promised during the election campaign. At the start, 250,000 jobs was a promise. Then it became a target. Then, a goal and, finally, a myth. Today, it is a farce ”, for his part underlined the deputy of Sanguinet.
“We promised jobs to families in Quebec; instead, the government reneged on its promise and pulled it out of their pockets to make up for its lack of economic vision. We need an economic plan, and quickly, ”concluded the member for Saint-Jean.
