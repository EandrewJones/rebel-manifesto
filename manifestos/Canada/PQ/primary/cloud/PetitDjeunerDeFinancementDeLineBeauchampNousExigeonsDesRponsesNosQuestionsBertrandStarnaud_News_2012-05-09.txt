Quebec - Failing to obtain answers to his questions during the question period concerning Line Beauchamp&#39;s fundraising breakfast on April 9, 2009 in Laval, the member for Chambly, deputy parliamentary leader and spokesperson for the official opposition in matters of ethics and public safety, Bertrand St-Arnaud, transmitted a written question which appears on this morning&#39;s order.
During this fundraising activity for the Liberal Party of Quebec, the newspaper La Presse reports that 15 to 20 guests were present and that this activity brought in the Liberal Association of Bourassa-Sauvé $ 61,500.
“It&#39;s not nothing, we are talking about a fundraising activity organized by engineers in which a well-known member of the Montreal mafia and key players from a firm that was negotiating with the ministry, including Line Beauchamp, participated. was the incumbent. Our questions are legitimate and for a week now, we have had this government answer anything, ”lamented Bertrand St-Arnaud.
The MP submitted a second question, this time relating to another fundraising activity organized for former Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau. “Nathalie Normandeau herself admitted that an engineering firm had organized a fundraising activity for her. And in the Liberal Party none of this seems to be a problem, ”added the Deputy House Leader.
“The questions that arise in relation to these activities are numerous. This is why we have decided to use as many means as possible to obtain answers. No one in this government seems inclined to shed light on these activities. It&#39;s grotesque! Added the member for Chambly.
