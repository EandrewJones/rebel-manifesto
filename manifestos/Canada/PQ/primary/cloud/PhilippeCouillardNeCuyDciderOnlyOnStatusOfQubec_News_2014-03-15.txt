Montreal - During a press briefing held yesterday, the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party, Philippe Couillard, made remarks that deserve important clarification. &quot;The statements by the leader of the Liberal Party, to the effect that he intends to travel across Canada to meet the conditions for Quebec to sign the Canadian Constitution, are very worrying, especially since he refuses to commit to consult Quebeckers on this subject, ”declared the Premier of Quebec and leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois.
Yesterday, Philippe Couillard declared: “In the early days of our government, we will travel the country, meet with the provinces, the Canadian territories, the federal government, first to talk about the economy and employment and by indicating to each both our hope that the specific character of Quebec will be recognized in the Constitution and that any constitutional discussion cannot welcome our participation without the question of Quebec being held there ”.
“Not only is everyone ignoring Philippe Couillard&#39;s conditions, but, unlike Robert Bourassa, who set the precedent during the referendum on the Charlottetown Accord, the Liberal leader seems to be ready to commit the future of Quebec as s &#39;it was a simple administrative formality,&#39; added the Prime Minister.
“Philippe Couillard should know that British Columbia and Alberta have passed laws that require a referendum before their legislatures can approve any constitutional amendment. This amounts to saying that the citizens of the other provinces would be consulted on our future, but not Quebeckers. This is unacceptable, ”concluded the leader of the Parti Québécois.
We have a plan and the team to be successful. Today, it is time to give ourselves the means to go even further.
