Quebec - Stéphane Bédard, MP for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, and Stéphane Bergeron, MP for Verchères and spokesperson for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, call on the Prime Minister to take concrete action to promote the Quebec&#39;s interests vis-à-vis the federal government.
“Philippe Couillard took the wrong platform; it is to Ottawa that he must go. At Queen&#39;s Park, he says that Canada will one day have to recognize Quebec&#39;s specificity, but what has he done over the past year to assert it? It&#39;s all well and good to address the Ontario Parliament, but what about concrete actions with Ottawa? Take the issues of the application of Bill 101 to federally chartered businesses and the firearms registry; even before making any demands, the government abdicated. Indeed, he will not claim compensation for the destruction of the data. Obviously, Philippe Couillard much prefers to attack families and regions of Quebec rather than claiming their fair share against Ottawa, ”said Stéphane Bédard.
The leader of the official opposition also recalls that last August, the Premier of Ontario, Kathleen Wynne, affirmed that Quebec&#39;s place within Canada was not on the radar screen.
Stéphane Bergeron for his part blasted the Prime Minister for the very short and timid list of demands he presented to Ottawa in anticipation of the next federal election. “The Prime Minister&#39;s list is clearly insufficient. Philippe Couillard presents even fewer requests than Jean Charest, who had listed a dozen in the 2008 federal election. Quebec is totally ignored in several cases, including those of the toll on the Champlain Bridge, from which it should come back for the shipbuilding contracts, and the imposition of a pan-Canadian securities commission. The list is long; the Prime Minister must go beyond words and finally assume his responsibilities, ”he added.
