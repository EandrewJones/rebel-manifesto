Quebec, November 21, 2017 - The official opposition spokesperson for finance, Nicolas Marceau, denounces the Liberal ploy which consisted in depriving Quebec of essential services, under the pretext that &quot;it was necessary&quot;, then to applaud because now is the time to redistribute, in the form of election candy, the money taken from taxpayers, patients and students.
IN SHORT
“We have just witnessed the start of the liberal electoral campaign. The tax cuts announced today have been paid for by taxpayers and by the drastic cuts in services over the past three years. The PLQ neglected the sick, students and the elderly in order to finance its 2018 elections, ”declared Nicolas Marceau.
“The reinvestments announced in public services are not comparable to what has been cut in recent years. Children who have been deprived of the professionals they need all this time will find it difficult to catch up; these students were sacrificed. The misery in which our seniors have been left, as the Ombudsperson has repeatedly denounced, will not be erased by clearly insufficient reinvestments. When we asked the Prime Minister why he had cut so much, he told us that &quot;it was necessary&quot;. We understand today that it was necessary only for his re-election plan, ”added the spokesperson.
“Philippe Couillard takes Quebeckers for idiots by imagining that they still trust the one who abandoned their children and their parents for an election check for $ 278. Same thing when he fails to tell them that with the little we are being told today for health, there will always be more money to increase doctors&#39; salaries than for the development of patient care. We sincerely believe that people can understand Liberal maneuvers and will remember them when the time comes. At that time, the Parti Québécois will be there to repair the damage caused by the Liberals, ”Nicolas Marceau concluded.
