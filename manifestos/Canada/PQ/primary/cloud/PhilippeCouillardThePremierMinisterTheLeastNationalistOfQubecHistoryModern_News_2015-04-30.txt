Quebec - The member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, asked Prime Minister Philippe Couillard to do his duty, which is to protect the interests of Quebecers vis-à-vis the federal government.
“Philippe Couillard took a step that no prime minister had taken before him: he completely put the defense of Quebec&#39;s interests in the hands of Quebec federal deputies. I remind him that his role is precisely to defend our interests in the face of unilateral decisions by the federal government, which penalize Quebec. Can someone wake him up? The Premier of Quebec is Canadian first, Canadian at all costs, ”declared Stéphane Bédard.
In the case of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program, for example, the Leader of the Official Opposition points out that the federal measures, which come into force today, violate an agreement signed with Quebec. In addition, they will have significant economic impacts. Business representatives unanimously decried the administrative burden imposed on them by the federal government. As for the Liberal government, it has never seen fit to document the real effects of these measures on the Quebec economy.
In addition, yesterday, the Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, confirmed that due to the changes made to the TFSA and the RRIF in the last federal budget, Quebec will lose $ 100 million per year.
“This loss of income will obviously have to be compensated for by Quebeckers, on whom we will impose new cuts. This is how the Liberal resignation to Ottawa continues. Before, Quebec affirmed its positions; now, we have a government that no longer leads any battles, a government that systematically abdicates. Ottawa says no, Quebec is crashing! », Concluded Stéphane Bédard.
