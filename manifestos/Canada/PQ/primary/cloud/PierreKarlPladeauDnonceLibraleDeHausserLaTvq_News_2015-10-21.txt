Quebec - As the Liberal government&#39;s economic update approaches, the member for Saint-Jérôme and leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, denounces the Prime Minister&#39;s intention to increase the QST this fall.
“The Liberal Prime Minister refused to answer my questions and to close the door on an increase in the QST. However, eight associations representing the retail sector in Quebec are warning the government against the devastating effects of a third QST hike in five years. According to them, some 480,000 jobs could be affected by this decision. The first two increases resulted in sales growth twice as low as in other years. What does the Prime Minister say to the associations of retailers who represent these 480,000 workers? “Asked Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“While Quebec already has the highest sales tax in North America, the government is unable to specify how it intends to resolve the booming problems associated with cross-border e-commerce. In 2012, Quebec was already losing half a billion in tax revenue because of this practice. In 2015, this amount is certainly much higher, since Internet sales increase by more than 10% per year and, often, no tax is charged. The Border Services Agency does nothing, Canada Post does nothing, and the Government of Quebec does not control the customs, the postal services, or the banks that issue the credit cards used for payments. While it intends to raise the QST, what will the government do to stem these problems? Added the leader of the official opposition.
