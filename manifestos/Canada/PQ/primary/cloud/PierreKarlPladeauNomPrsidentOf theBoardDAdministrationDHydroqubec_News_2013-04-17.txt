The Council of Ministers of the Marois government today appointed Mr. Pierre Karl Péladeau as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Hydro-Québec. He will take up his duties on May 15, 2013.
Pauline Marois asked one of the great entrepreneurs of Quebec to take the head of the board of directors of one of our most important crown corporations. There is no doubt about his competence: his experience, his expertise, his business acumen will benefit all of Quebec.
Mr. Péladeau has agreed to donate his time and share his expertise, without pay. We welcome this gesture. He also committed to withdraw from any board meeting if questions related to Quebecor arise.
Hydro-Quebec is a gem that belongs to all Quebecers; an entrepreneur at the head of its board of directors will be beneficial for all of Quebec.
