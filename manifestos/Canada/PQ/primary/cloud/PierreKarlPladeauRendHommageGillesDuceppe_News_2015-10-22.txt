Quebec - The member for Saint-Jérôme and leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, paid tribute to Gilles Duceppe, following the announcement of his departure.
“Gilles Duceppe is a man of convictions. Throughout his career, he defended the interests of Quebecers on the federal scene with passion and rigor. Over the months, since my arrival in politics, I have been able to appreciate Gilles&#39; depth, experience and intellectual honesty, qualities which have enabled us to forge a beautiful friendship. Quebec owes him a lot, as does the independence movement. His contribution to our project is invaluable, and I know he will continue to serve the cause. We can only be grateful to him for all his commitment to Quebec. Thanks, Gilles! », Declared Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“In June 2015, Gilles made a courageous decision to come back as leader of the Bloc Québécois. He led a very good electoral campaign and was able to demonstrate all his knowledge of the issues linking Quebec to the federal government. He mobilized around him a team of determined candidates, made up of many young people of the emerging independence. I wish him a peaceful return to his wife, Yolande, and to his family, ”concluded the leader of the official opposition.
