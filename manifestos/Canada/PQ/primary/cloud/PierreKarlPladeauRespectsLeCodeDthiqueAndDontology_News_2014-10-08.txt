Quebec - As he has always undertaken to do, the MNA for Saint-Jérôme, Pierre Karl Péladeau, insisted on fully respecting the provisions of the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct for Members of the National Assembly.
To this end, as indicated in article 25 of the Code, before the debate begins on the Caquist motion concerning him by name, the deputy publicly and without delay declared a personal interest distinct from that of all the deputies. . He therefore withdrew from the meeting without exercising his right to vote or participate in the debate on the matter.
The member for Saint-Jérôme had informed the Secretary General of the National Assembly and the Ethics and Professional Conduct Commissioner.
