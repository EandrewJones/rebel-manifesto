Quebec, February 15, 2017 - Nicole Léger, Parti Québécois spokesperson for the Conseil du trésor, deplores that the president of the Conseil du trésor, Pierre Moreau, has still not succeeded in settling the labor dispute that his government is making continue with state lawyers, and that her colleague Minister of Justice, Stéphanie Vallée, washes her hands of it.
“Lawyers believed Pierre Moreau when he said that settling this conflict was his priority and that of his Prime Minister. Rather, it made the climate worse yesterday. It is becoming increasingly clear that the government is engaged in a strategy aimed at the exhaustion of strikers rather than in good faith negotiations, ”explained Nicole Léger.
“The Parti Québécois is once again asking Pierre Moreau to publicly table the offers the government has made to state lawyers. People want to know if the minister&#39;s claims are correct; they want confirmation that the offers made to state lawyers and notaries are the same as those submitted to criminal and penal prosecutors, ”added the spokesperson.
Nicole Léger is surprised, moreover, by the absence in the file of the Minister of Justice. &quot;Where is Stéphanie Vallée, once again?&quot; What is she doing to defend the rule of law and justice in Quebec? The state acts without a legal compass. We have never seen a Minister of Justice abdicate her responsibilities so much. It has let down its lawyers, who are its right arms in the governance of the state. It has also and above all failed Quebeckers, those who are before the courts and who are waiting to settle their case. More than 3000 files are delayed because of this strike! Yesterday, the Bar once again urged her to consider the fundamental role of state lawyers in the smooth running of legislative activities. Where is she? », She asked.
