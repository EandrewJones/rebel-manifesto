Québec, August 29, 2016 - André Villeneuve, the member for Berthier and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on agriculture, protests against the general increase in property taxes that farmers will suffer from 2017, a consequence of the reform of the Agricultural Property Tax Credit Program (PCTFA). Because, contrary to the assertions of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Paradis, 83% of agricultural producers will see their tax bill increase.
“Minister Paradis has misled farmers by claiming that the changes to the PCTFA will be done at zero cost. The analysis produced by his department is clear: under the new program, 83% of agricultural producers in Quebec will pay more taxes. Some of them will have to pay additional sums of up to thousands of dollars! In total, the Liberal government will brazenly pluck millions from the pockets of our producers, ”denounced André Villeneuve.
Let us recall that during the study of the appropriations, last April, the Minister trivialized the legitimate concerns raised by the reform of the PCTFA. “Pierre Paradis again tried to fool the farmers. Without the questions asked by the Parti Québécois, they would have had a very bad surprise when they received their tax bill. Now, the minister must admit his faults and cancel his unjust and abusive reform, ”concluded the deputy for Berthier.
