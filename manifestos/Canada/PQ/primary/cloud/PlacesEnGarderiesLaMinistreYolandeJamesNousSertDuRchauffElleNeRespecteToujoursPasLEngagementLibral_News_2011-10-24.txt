Quebec - &quot;Minister James&#39; announcement today for the development of 15,000 new subsidized child care spaces not only smacks of hot air, but is a decoy: these spaces will not be available for another five years. . It is a confirmation that the liberal commitment will not be respected ”.
This is what the member for Iberville and official opposition critic for family matters, Marie Bouillé, said, who believes that Minister Yolande James is trying to make people believe that the Liberal government is in action while the development of child care spaces has stagnated for several years.
In the budget presented in March 2011 by the Minister of Finance, Raymond Bachand, the latter specified in the appendices that the 15,000 places promised during the 2008 election campaign will not be delivered before 2016. “Or else it is Minister Bachand or it&#39;s Minister James, but one of them is not telling us the truth. In the meantime, it is the parents who pay the price, they who are waiting for places in a glaring and urgent way in several cases, ”continued Marie Bouillé.
The member also recalls that in 2007 the Liberal government undertook to create 18,000 places by March 2011. However, of these promised places, still 4300 places have not been created. “By insisting on the 15,000 places that must be created, the minister herself seems to forget that she still has 4,300 from the previous commitment. In short, the delay accumulates and development is done in a trickle, &quot;illustrates the spokesperson.
She did not fail to point out that the day after the budget speech, Minister James issued a press release in which she said that the creation of the 15,000 spaces, “let&#39;s go! », According to his expression. “She uses the same expression even today in her press release! Yet nothing has changed. All this is just window dressing. What parents want is action, not political marketing, ”concluded Marie Bouillé.
