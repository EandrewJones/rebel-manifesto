Québec– The MNA for Marie-Victorin and official opposition spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, and the MNA for Jonquière and spokesperson for sustainable development and the environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, note that the Liberal government is secretly reopening the shale gas industry, hiding behind a new environmental study.
The best sign the Liberals are prepared to do is their refusal to debate a motion this week calling for the government to reintroduce Bill 37, which would impose a moratorium on exploration and mining. exploitation of shale gas.
“Even if we add a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) to the two public hearings on the environment and to the SEA that has already taken place, there will not be more social acceptability for shale gas. The people of the St. Lawrence Valley do not want it. We are witnessing a proliferation of studies in the hope of changing popular perception, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
Otherwise, the Liberal plan unveiled today repeats what the Parti Québécois did to correct the mistakes of the Charest government. “The Liberals are continuing in our direction for Anticosti, Old Harry, Enbridge, and the drinking water regulation. For Anticosti, for example, they had let go of the permits for a bite of bread. With the government of the Parti Québécois, the population had resumed its rights on Anticosti, ”recalled Bernard Drainville.
