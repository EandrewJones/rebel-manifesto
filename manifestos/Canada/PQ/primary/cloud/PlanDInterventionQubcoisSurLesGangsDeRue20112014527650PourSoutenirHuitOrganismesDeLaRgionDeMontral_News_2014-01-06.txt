“I am happy to financially support these projects aimed at offering young people in the community various services tailored to their needs, thus preventing crime and preventing them from joining street gangs. The mission of these organizations is a fine example of an initiative that the Government of Quebec wishes to encourage, so that they can continue their essential work, ”said Mr. Bergeron.
&quot;Through their commitment and targeted actions, the workers in these organizations help prevent and counter the phenomenon of street gangs, and it is with pride that we support them in concrete terms in their efforts,&quot; said Mr. Lisée. .
This program ensures that the pressure on street gangs is maintained and offers young people perspectives other than the world of delinquency and criminality. It makes it possible to pursue actions aimed at reducing the crime associated with street gangs, deterring young people at risk from joining them and helping members of street gangs to leave this universe.
