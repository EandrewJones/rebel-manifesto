Quebec - The Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron and Ms. Marie Malavoy, Minister responsible for the Montérégie region, announce the granting of $ 45,780 to the Maison des jeunes Merciérois, as part of the Plan Quebec intervention on street gangs.
“I am happy to financially support this organization&#39;s project aimed at offering young people in the community various services tailored to their needs, thereby preventing crime and preventing them from joining street gangs. The mission of the Maison des jeunes Merciérois is a fine example of an initiative that the Government of Quebec wishes to encourage, so that the organization can continue this essential work ”, declared Mr. Bergeron.
&quot;Through their commitment and their targeted actions, the interveners of the Maison des jeunes Merciérois contribute to preventing and countering the phenomenon of street gangs, and it is with pride that we support them concretely in their efforts&quot;, declared Mrs. Malavoy.
This program ensures that the pressure on street gangs is maintained and offers young people perspectives other than the world of delinquency and criminality. It makes it possible to pursue actions aimed at reducing the crime associated with street gangs, deterring young people at risk from joining them and helping members of street gangs to leave this universe.
