Quebec - The Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron and Mr. Bernard Drainville, Member of Parliament for Marie-Victorin, announce the granting of $ 50,756 to the organization Macadam Sud, as part of the Intervention Plan Quebecers on street gangs.
“I am happy to financially support this organization&#39;s project aimed at offering young people in the community various services tailored to their needs, thereby preventing crime and preventing them from joining street gangs. Macadam Sud&#39;s mission is a fine example of an initiative that the Government of Quebec wishes to encourage, so that the organization can continue this essential work, ”declared Mr. Bergeron.
“Macadam Sud is making a concrete contribution to fighting the street gang phenomenon in Longueuil. Its contribution is essential to our community and it is the fieldwork and proximity that makes it possible to achieve this mission. I am very proud of our government&#39;s support for this organization, ”said Mr. Drainville.
This program provides an alternative to the attraction of street gangs and offers young people perspectives other than delinquency and crime. It makes it possible to pursue actions aimed at reducing the crime associated with street gangs, deterring young people at risk from joining them and helping members of street gangs to leave this environment.
