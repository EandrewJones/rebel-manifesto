Montreal - The MP for Vachon and official opposition spokesperson for mines and shale gas, Martine Ouellet, notes that the concerns of the Parti Québécois on Jean Charest&#39;s Marketing Plan for the North are shared by the employees of the State, according to information published by the daily Le Devoir, on Saturday, January 28.
In an internal document, the Syndicat de la function publique du Québec denounces the laxity of the Liberal government, which does nothing to ensure that the State has the staff required to ensure the sustainable development of projects that could eventually emerge from the Plan Nord. . &quot;Everything is in place so that the open bar is maintained and that companies benefit from it without giving Quebecers their fair share because the Charest government refuses to carry out responsible economic development,&quot; criticized Martine Ouellet.
The Parti Québécois tried, without success, to pass an amendment to Bill 14 on mines so that the government is obliged to make public, each year, the tonnage extracted, the royalties collected and the net value. resources withdrawn. “The refusal of the Liberals and Minister Serge Simard is unacceptable. Quebecers have the right to know what is coming out of their basement, ”continued Martine Ouellet.
In addition, the member for Vachon corroborates the information to the effect that expertise is extremely rare in the field. “In a parliamentary committee last spring, we learned that there are only three full-time inspectors to monitor all mines in Quebec! With the size of our territory and the current mining boom, this situation is laughable, ”she added.
&quot;It is imperative to strengthen the expertise of the State for sustainable mining development so as not to relive a situation like at the Quebec Ministry of Transport where the private sector literally took the keys to the ministry,&quot; concluded Martine Ouellet.
