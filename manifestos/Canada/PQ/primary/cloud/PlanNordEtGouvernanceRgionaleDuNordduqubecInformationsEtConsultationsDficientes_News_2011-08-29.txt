Chibougamau - Following numerous comments heard from his fellow citizens during the summer period and at the end of a regional tour of Nord-du-Québec, the Member of Parliament for Ungava and official opposition spokesperson for Nordic Development Officer, Luc Ferland, concludes that there are serious gaps in the transmission of information about the Plan Nord in the region.
“Beyond the announcements of Prime Minister Jean Charest concerning some infrastructure projects and promotional tours outside Quebec, very little regional information has allowed citizens to get a precise idea of what this Plan Nord represents for the Nord-du-Québec region. Let us be clear: it is not normal for a project of this scale to remain unknown to residents of the main region concerned, ”said Luc Ferland.
Several questions remain unanswered. “What happens with the announcement of the subtraction of 50% of the territory from all industrial activity? The law creating the Société du Plan Nord should be passed this fall, we still have no idea who will represent us and in what proportion? Where will the head office and the main officers be located? In the north or in the south? Asks the deputy of Ungava.
Remember that new governance of the James Bay territory was announced last May between the Crees, the Jamesians and the government of Quebec. On this occasion, the partners set themselves a deadline of 12 months to reach a negotiated settlement. In this regard, the deputy is concerned about the little information provided on the progress of this operation.
“I firmly intend to ensure that specific information tours are organized in our region. The government has a duty to meet, first and foremost, the populations directly affected by projects of this nature, especially when we know that they will inevitably have an impact on our future, ”concluded Luc Ferland.
