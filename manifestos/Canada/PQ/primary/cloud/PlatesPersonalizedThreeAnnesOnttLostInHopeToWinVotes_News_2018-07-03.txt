Official Opposition Finance Critic Nicolas Marceau, Transport Critic Martin Ouellet and Former Parti Québécois Transport Minister Sylvain Gaudreault deplore the Liberal government to procrastinate for three years before allowing personalized license plates.
IN SHORT
Minister of Transport in the Parti Québécois government, Sylvain Gaudreault recalls: “We announced that in the fall of 2015, Quebec would allow personalized license plates. Almost three years later, after hesitating, procrastinating and dodging, the Liberals finally announce that the program will be implemented. Surprisingly, this announcement takes place three months before the election; It&#39;s still amazing! The government must explain to us why it made Quebeckers wait so long, if only to take advantage of the pre-electoral context, ”he explained.
“It was during our study of Bill 150, the government&#39;s financial omnibus, that we learned that the Liberals had decided to bring this proposal back to the table. What a surprise! The Liberals did an about-face and quickly removed the provision for personalized plaques. It is thanks to our vigilance that it was brought back. In short, the government will announce it today, but people are not fooled: they know that these three years of waiting are the result of Liberal calculation, ”continued Nicolas Marceau.
“Of course, since the Liberals&#39; late announcement is practically copied from the one made by the Parti Québécois, we welcome it positively. Vehicle owners have been calling for such a possibility for many years. It was high time that Quebec followed suit with the rest of North America! », Concluded Martin Ouellet.
