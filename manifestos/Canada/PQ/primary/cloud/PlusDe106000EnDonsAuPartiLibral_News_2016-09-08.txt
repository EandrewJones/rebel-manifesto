Québec, September 8, 2016 - The member for Taschereau and the Parti Québécois spokesperson in matters of ethics and integrity, Agnès Maltais, remains dissatisfied with the answers provided by Laurent Lessard and Philippe Couillard regarding the conflict of interests in which the first is immersed since this morning.
“We first learned about the Lessard affair, which can be summed up as follows: Pyrobiom Énergies inc., The forestry company of Yvon Nadeau, a former political attaché to the Minister of Forests at the time, Laurent Lessard, received the maximum admissible subsidy of $ 3M from the Technoclimat program. We are now revealing that since 2000, the directors of Pyrobiom Énergies Inc., and other related companies, have collectively contributed to the Liberal Party for a sum of $ 106,150, ”indicated the Member for Taschereau.
“This morning&#39;s revelations already raised many questions about the allocation of the $ 3M grant to Pyrobiom Énergies inc. Yet Premier Couillard does not seem the least bit disturbed - nor interested, for that matter - by the doubts hanging over his new Minister of Transport. Now, with these new revelations about liberal donors appearing in the file, we discover the extent of the presence of the liberal sector in this affair. We are talking about more than $ 100,000 collected among the administrators concerned who went into the Liberal Party&#39;s election fund! Added the spokesperson.
“The more we dig into the Lessard affair, the more questions we ask ourselves about the integrity of the Liberal Party. Once again, Philippe Couillard fails an ethics test by brushing aside serious revelations about a minister in his government, ”concluded Agnès Maltais.
