Sainte-Marie - The Minister of Labor, Employment and Social Solidarity and Minister responsible for the Capitale-Nationale and Chaudière-Appalaches regions, Ms. Agnès Maltais, on behalf of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and of Land Occupation and Minister of Transport, Sylvain Gaudreault, announces the allocation of financial assistance of $ 201,000 to the Corporation du Domaine du Seigneur Taschereau for the construction of an overhead walkway.
Located in the heart of the City of Sainte-Marie, the Domaine du Seigneur Taschereau is a vast public space of more than 50 hectares dedicated to the observation and interpretation of a natural wetland specific to Beauce: the plain floodplain of the Chaudière River and its wet ecosystems. Deploying over 270 meters in length and 4.5 meters in height, the aerial footbridge will fly over, successively, a marsh, a shrub swamp, a woodland and a wet meadow. Visitors will be able to appreciate the extent of the floods which, otherwise, leave no trace in the summer season.
&quot;It is with great pride that our government supports this structuring project in terms of tourism and ecology, which will develop the outdoor offer in the region and ensure the conservation and enhancement of the site&#39;s ecological diversity for the benefit of current and future generations ”, declared Minister Agnès Maltais.
Financial assistance comes from the conjunctural development fund of the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy.
