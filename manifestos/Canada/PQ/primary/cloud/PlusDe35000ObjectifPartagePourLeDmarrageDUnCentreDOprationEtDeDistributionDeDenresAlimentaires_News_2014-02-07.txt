Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts– The Vice-President of the National Assembly and Member of Parliament for Bertrand, Mr. Claude Cousineau, on behalf of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announces the allocation of financial assistance of $ 35,600 to Objectif Partage for the start-up of a food operation and distribution center.
Objectif Partage is a group of non-profit organizations that provide food support to more than 500 disadvantaged people in the Regional County Municipality (MRC) of the Laurentians. To pursue its mission and meet ever-growing demand, the organization must upgrade its equipment and set up an operation, collection and distribution center at the six food counters and the seven collective kitchens of the MRC. This center would be equipped with cold rooms, unloading equipment and a refrigerated truck to collect food from major suppliers and redistribute them as needed. It will thus be able to meet the needs of the citizens of seven municipalities in the southern part of the MRC.
“Solidarity is a primordial value for our government, and that is why it is at the heart of our concerns and our action. It is therefore with pride that we support the realization of this promising project, which will ensure the well-being of the most vulnerable individuals and families in the MRC des Laurentides, ”said MP Cousineau.
Financial assistance comes from the conjunctural development fund of the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy.
