Quebec - The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, today announces a historic increase in the eligibility thresholds for legal aid, which will in particular give access to free legal aid to people working full time at minimum wage. As of January 1, this increase will also make it possible to offer free coverage to seniors living alone and mainly benefiting from the guaranteed income supplement.
The announcement was made to the National Assembly in the presence of the Bâtonnière du Québec, Maître Johanne Brodeur, Ad. E., and the President of the Legal Services Commission, Maître Denis Roy.
“This substantial improvement in the Quebec legal aid system is at the heart of the Quebec government&#39;s commitments to more accessible justice, justice for all. With this historic increase in the eligibility thresholds for legal aid, more than 500,000 additional people will soon have access to the free component of this plan, ”said the Minister of Justice.
With this substantial increase, the Government of Quebec is responding to the recommendations made over the years in numerous reports, and to the concerns expressed for decades by the judiciary, the Barreau du Québec and several groups from the community sector.
“For almost 30 years, a person working full time for minimum wage has not been eligible for free legal aid. This is unacceptable and contrary to the spirit of the legal aid program introduced in 1973. It is also a considerable obstacle to our fellow citizens&#39; access to justice. We made a commitment that that will change, and that will change, ”added the Minister of Justice.
The new regulation, which will be published in the Gazette officielle du Québec next week, will lead, over a period of one and a half years, to an increase of more than 30% in the eligibility thresholds for free legal aid for a single person. This threshold will first drop from $ 14,140 currently to $ 16,306 on January 1, 2014 - 15.3% increase - before being set on June 1, 2015 at the amount corresponding to the annual income of a person then working in the minimum wage at the rate of 35 hours per week.
For a couple with two children, the thresholds for the free component will go from $ 23,184 at present to $ 26,737 on January 1, 2014, then to more than $ 30,000 on June 1, 2015.
The costs of this improvement are evaluated, in the long term, at nearly $ 17 million per year. They may fluctuate depending on the requests actually accepted.
In addition, an important element, the eligibility threshold for legal aid will henceforth be automatically adjusted according to the minimum wage, thus ensuring that access to legal aid is permanently maintained.
Remember that legal aid covers the services provided for in the Legal Aid Act and the provision of certain other legal services. In particular, it can be granted for cases relating to civil, family, administrative, criminal, mental health, immigration and youth law.
“The Government of Quebec makes it a point of honor to administer justice with integrity, fairness and humanity. Today, I am proud to say that our justice system will henceforth be even more human, even more united, ”concluded the Minister of Justice.
