Quebec - The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, confirms that the Council of Ministers yesterday adopted the regulation providing for a historic increase in the eligibility thresholds for legal aid as of January 1, 2014.
Starting next month, this increase will provide free coverage to seniors living alone and mostly benefiting from the guaranteed income supplement. Then, in June 2015, it will give access to free legal aid to people working full time at minimum wage.
“With this substantial improvement to the Quebec legal aid plan, more than 500,000 additional people will soon have access to the free component of this plan. This increase will help make our justice system even more humane and more united, ”said the Minister of Justice.
For almost 30 years, a person working full-time at minimum wage was not eligible for free legal aid, which was contrary to the spirit of this program introduced in 1973. By correcting this situation, the government of Québec has come to respond to the recommendations made over the years in numerous reports as well as to the concerns expressed for decades by the judiciary, the Barreau du Québec and several groups from the community sector.
Thus, between January 1, 2014 and June 1, 2015, the eligibility threshold for free legal aid for a single person will increase by 30%. Currently set at $ 14,140, it will be increased to $ 16,306 as of January 1, 2014, or a 15.3% increase. As of June 1, 2015, it will be set at the amount corresponding to the annual income of a person working at minimum wage for 35 hours per week, then indexed annually.
For a couple with two children, the thresholds for the free component will go from $ 23,184 at present to $ 26,737 on January 1, 2014, then to more than $ 30,000 on June 1, 2015.
The costs of this improvement are evaluated, in the long term, at nearly $ 17 million per year. They may fluctuate depending on the requests actually accepted.
The increase in the eligibility thresholds for legal aid is in line with the government orientations on which the “Solidarity” pillar is based, one of the four pillars of government action, along with integrity, prosperity and identity. These guidelines, made public on October 30 by Prime Minister Pauline Marois, will guide the government&#39;s action in implementing measures aimed at improving the well-being of the most vulnerable individuals and families. The government thus wants to give new impetus to solidarity, a value inseparable from collective wealth.
