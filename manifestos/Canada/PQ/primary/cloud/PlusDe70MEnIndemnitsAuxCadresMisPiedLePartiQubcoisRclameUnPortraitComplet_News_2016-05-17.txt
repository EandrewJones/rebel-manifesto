Quebec - In the case of the reform of health structures of Gaétan Barrette, Diane Lamarre, Member of Parliament for Taillon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of health and accessibility to care, deplores the fact that patients are once again the big ones losers. It requires the Minister to make public a complete, clear and up-to-date portrait of the amounts paid in severance pay to executives and for the management of the transition in the institutions.
&quot;While the Minister had confirmed this fall that 38 million would be paid in severance pay to the 1051 executives of the health network who were shown the door in 2015-2016, the total that we determined using requests access to information is more than 70 million. And that&#39;s without taking into account that managers who are still in post have to deal with a double or even a triple task. The effects are also starting to be felt, ”lamented the spokesperson.
“The amount of compensation paid, ie 70 million, is equivalent to the new investments announced in the budget for health; out of a total of 33.8 billion, it is a drop in the ocean, ”continued Diane Lamarre.
“We should also mention that four establishments refused to answer us; We demand, for the sake of transparency, that the minister make public the information held by these establishments concerning the allowances paid to executives. This complete portrait that we are asking for would allow us to follow up, although partial but necessary, of the deployment of this reform, the effects of which on the ground are not very shining, ”added the deputy.
“Finally, let us recall that the request for an evaluation of the Minister&#39;s reforms by the Auditor General remained unanswered, despite the high number of signatories who joined their voices to those of Paul Lamarche, Pierre Joubert and Marc-André Maranda. We support this approach; it seems essential to us that a neutral and objective assessment be made, ”concluded Diane Lamarre.
