Quebec - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and Parti Québécois spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, deplores the fact that the Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Lise Thériault, has refused her proposal to hold public consultations for the next policy and action plan relating to gender equality.
“Just before the study of the estimates, along with the Group of 13, we asked the minister to hold her consultations in the open, instead of in camera. She refused. It is a break with tradition. The minister did not even attend the consultations held with the groups behind closed doors! However, public consultations make it possible to sensitize the population to the question of equality between women and men, and to make links between the interventions of the groups, a more effective way of doing things than consulting them on an individual basis ” , said Carole Poirier.
The Member recalls that consultations were carried out for the first policy (2007-2011), as well as for the second (2011-2015). At that time, 42 groups had been heard in parliamentary committee at the National Assembly. For the third policy, the Secretariat for the Status of Women consulted 64 groups behind closed doors.
Carole Poirier also denounced the impacts of austerity policies on the living conditions of women in Quebec. “Violence against women is not just sexual, physical or psychological. It is also embodied in economic policies which directly affect them. Several elements must be discussed and put in place so that legal equality becomes de facto equality, whether in terms of the representation of women in politics or in those of public health, childcare centers, or fight against sexual violence. This government has made massive cuts in several of these sectors, mostly affecting women. Today the minister had the chance to raise the bar; she should have taken this opportunity to openly consult all the people and organizations concerned, ”concluded Carole Poirier.
