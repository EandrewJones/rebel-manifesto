Papineauville - As part of a tour of Quebec which stops today in the Outaouais, the Minister for the Regions and Minister responsible for the Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine region, Mr. Gaétan Lelièvre, accompanied by Minister of Public Security and Minister responsible for the Outaouais region, Stéphane Bergeron, has confirmed the granting of more than $ 5 million to rural MRCs in the Outaouais region for the implementation of implementation of the National Rurality Policy. Following a commitment by the Premier of Quebec, Ms. Pauline Marois, to improve rural pacts, the National Policy on Rurality was renewed for a period of ten years with an envelope of $ 470 million. Created in 2001 by the Parti Québécois, the National Policy on Rurality provides unprecedented support to rural areas and regions of Quebec.
“The assistance announced today will allow those who have the development of their community at heart to give new impetus to the most inspiring and promising projects in their community. Long matured, this policy is based on the capacity of rural areas to mobilize and work on an intersectoral basis: an innovative and decisive approach for land use and rural life in Quebec. This new national policy on rurality will allow the implementation of major projects in the regions of Quebec, ”said Minister Lelièvre.
