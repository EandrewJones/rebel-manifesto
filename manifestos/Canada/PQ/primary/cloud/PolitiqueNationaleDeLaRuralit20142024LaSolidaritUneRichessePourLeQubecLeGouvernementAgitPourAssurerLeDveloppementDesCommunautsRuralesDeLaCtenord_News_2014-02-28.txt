This new national policy on rurality will allow the implementation of major projects in the regions of Quebec, ”said Minister Lelièvre.

The intersectoral approach should henceforth characterize the management of the rural pact as well as that of the &quot;pact plus&quot; since it is by rallying around a common vision and ensuring the complementarity of their actions that the actors of rural development will be able to optimize. the repercussions on their environment.

Our government is thus sending a clear signal of its desire to support rural Quebec. The Parti Québécois shows that it is the true party of the regions, ”concluded Marjolain Dufour.
“The development of rural areas is a priority for the development of our region. It is therefore an important promise that our government is making today to the citizens of the Côte-Nord, since the sums granted will allow rural actors to continue the development of their communities and to embark on the realization of promising projects that will contribute to build strong rurality throughout the region, ”said MP Richard.
