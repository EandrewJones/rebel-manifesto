Chapais– As part of a tour of Quebec which stops today in Nord-du-Quebec, the Minister for the Regions and Minister responsible for the Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine region, Mr. Gaétan Lelièvre, accompanied by the Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Natural Resources (Nordic Affairs section) and Member of Parliament for Ungava, Mr. Luc Ferland, confirmed the granting of more than one million dollars to the Baie-James regional administration for the implementation of the National Rurality Policy in the Nord-du-Québec region. Following a commitment by the Premier of Quebec, Ms. Pauline Marois, to improve rural pacts, the National Policy on Rurality was renewed for a period of ten years with an envelope of $ 470 million. Created in 2001 by the Parti Québécois, the National Policy on Rurality provides unprecedented support to rural areas and regions of Quebec.
