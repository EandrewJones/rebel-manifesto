Quebec - The MNA for Champlain and official opposition spokesperson for rurality, Noëlla Champagne, is pleased to mark the 10th anniversary of the National Policy on Rurality.
“Ten years ago, a Parti Québécois government adopted the National Policy on Rurality with the aim of giving the rural world and regions more development tools. When we know that more than 8000 projects have resulted from this policy, we can conclude that it is a great success. Moreover, an international organization as prestigious as the OECD has explicitly recognized this, ”declared Noëlla Champagne.
The Parti Québécois has always believed that it is through a bottom-up approach that Quebec can fully develop its full potential. It is no coincidence that the National Policy on Rurality was part of a series of measures respecting this approach:
-creation of regional county municipalities (MRC), -Law on land use planning and planning, -Policy to support local and regional development, -creation of local development centers (CLD).
“Today, the Parti Québécois continues in this direction. We have just tabled Bill 499 on the dynamic occupation of the territory and decentralization and over the coming months, we will closely monitor the government so that it draws up a 3rd version of the National Rurality Policy which would allow the rural world to go even further, ”concluded the Member for Champlain.
