Quebec - The Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Marie Malavoy, this morning launched the first of three national consultations announced in the wake of the launch of the green paper entitled The taste and the pleasure of moving: towards a national policy of sport, leisure and physical activity. For the occasion, she was accompanied by her parliamentary assistant and Member of Parliament for Labelle, Mr. Sylvain Pagé, who was given the mandate to lead the national and regional meetings.
“The points of view that will be shared during these consultations will shed valuable light on the development of our future national policy on sport, recreation and physical activity. Let us together set the objective that this policy is the reflection of the society that we want to build, a society in action, which takes charge of itself and which goes to the limit of its potential, ”concluded Minister Malavoy.
Remember that the first two national meetings, which will be held in Quebec City on June 18 and 20, deal respectively with the development of sports practice, the promotion of a physically active lifestyle and the development of recreational activities. During the third meeting, which will take place in Montreal on June 21, the partners will discuss the development of sports excellence.
“This week we are meeting key players in sport, leisure and physical activity who, with the expertise they have developed, will help us find the keys to give Quebeckers the desire to move. I want to thank them for their presence at these consultations, which eloquently testifies to their commitment. This presence is the first step in the success of our project, ”concluded Mr. Pagé.
