Montreal - The Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports, Ms. Marie Malavoy, presented this morning, along with her parliamentary assistant and Member of Parliament for Labelle, Mr. Sylvain Pagé, the green paper entitled Le Taste et le Pleasure to move: towards a national policy on sport, leisure and physical activity.
“The green paper that I am presenting to you today will support an important democratic exercise: the holding of national and regional consultations as well as a public consultation,” said the Minister. “The national policy on sport, leisure and physical activity concerns all citizens of Quebec, regardless of their age. It aims to bring them together around a collective challenge, a social project animated and supported by the State, with the support of all the actors concerned and all sectors of society, ”she added. .
This green paper focuses on four issues. First, on access to physical, recreational and sports activities: whether it be access to facilities, available time or financial constraints of various kinds. Second, on the quality of the experiences, that is to say on the supervision necessary to meet the needs of the people and the establishment of a security framework. Third, on the promotion of the practice of physical, recreational and sports activities. To change behavior, we must educate, inform and motivate citizens. And finally, on consultation. A clear and shared vision of the roles and responsibilities of the different partners involved is an essential condition for offering the appropriate services.
