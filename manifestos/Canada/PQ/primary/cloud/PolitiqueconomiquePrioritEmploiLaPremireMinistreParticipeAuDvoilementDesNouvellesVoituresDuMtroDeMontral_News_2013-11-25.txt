La Pocatière - The Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, accompanied by the Minister for Tourism and Minister responsible for the Bas-Saint-Laurent region, Pascal Bérubé, participated this morning in the unveiling of the new cars for the Montreal metro, at an event held at the Bombardier plant in La Pocatière, in the presence of more than 600 employees.
“Today, above all, we are celebrating Quebec&#39;s know-how and the excellence of its workers. These new state-of-the-art metro cars are impressive. These cars will offer exceptional comfort, greater passenger capacity, optimal safety, greater performance and increased reliability, ”said the Premier.
Presented by the Bombardier-Alstom consortium, these first nine cars, of the 468 to be produced in total, represent an important milestone in the implementation of a major government priority: the electrification of transport. “The Société de transport de Montréal is an essential partner in electrifying transportation. Her contribution is invaluable and will help us collectively reach the ambitious target of energy independence, ”added Pauline Marois.
The production of the new Montreal metro cars directly and indirectly creates hundreds of jobs, not only in La Pocatière, but also everywhere else in Quebec.
“I am proud to see that the challenge launched to the Bombardier-Alstom consortium has been successfully taken up by the workers of Bas-Saint-Laurent. Even more concretely, this challenge represents quality jobs and stimulates the entire regional economy. Future niches such as public and electric transport are refreshing for Bas-Saint-Laurent, ”concluded the Minister for Tourism and Minister responsible for the Bas-Saint-Laurent region.
The new cars will be integrated gradually until the end of 2018.
