Montreal - &quot;We are very disappointed with the partisan response of the Premier of Quebec, Jean Charest, who rejected out of hand the proposition that the Parti Québécois made yesterday to form a delegation of elected officials, of business people. and representatives of the Coalition Champlain in the works: When? to meet with the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, to demand a commitment from the federal government to build a new bridge. We believe that it is more than ever necessary to organize a summit meeting with Mr. Harper in order to break the current impasse which leaves the citizens of the South Shore and the Island of Montreal in uncertainty ” said Nicolas Girard, official opposition spokesperson for transport and MNA for Gouin.
“Despite Quebec unanimity in favor of the construction of a new Champlain Bridge, nothing is happening in Ottawa. Jean Charest&#39;s strategy is not working, he needs help, ”said the member for Gouin.
Nicolas Girard recalled that the Prime Minister last week implored the Harper government to give a signal on the future of the Champlain Bridge. “To get out of the cul-de-sac with Ottawa on the Champlain Bridge, has the Premier of Quebec at least demanded a meeting with Stephen Harper? Added the official opposition spokesperson for transport.
The Parti Québécois is once again reaching out to the Premier of Quebec in order to work together to obtain a commitment from the federal government for the construction of a new Champlain Bridge. “This is a major issue for the economy of Montreal. The wait has gone on long enough, ”he added.
“Should we remember that the Liberal Minister of Transport still refuses, despite repeated requests from all stakeholders, to make public all the inspection reports of all road structures in the greater Montreal area. Didn&#39;t he promise to do so in the days following the collapse of the Viger tunnel? Does he think people have forgotten? », Wondered Nicolas Girard.
