Quebec - The MP for Vachon and official opposition spokesperson for transport, Martine Ouellet, and the MP for Terrebonne, Mathieu Traversy, denounced the authorization given by the Minister of Transport, Robert Poëti, for the toll rates on the Highway 25 bridge are increased by 26% during rush hour.
“It&#39;s absurd to accept a 26% increase for users when the company is already making millions of dollars in profits. This measure will pay off twice for her since, inevitably, traffic will increase over time; if we add to that the increase in prices, the private company will make a lot more money, at the expense of the middle class, ”said Martine Ouellet.
The highway 25 bridge was privatized by the Charest government for its maintenance and management. The company finances its operations through the revenues from the tolls. However, if we rely on the new schedule presented by the company and authorized by the Minister, if you do not have a transponder, you will now have to pay $ 16.84 for a single return trip between Montreal and Laval.
“Now that the citizens of the North Shore have gotten into the habit of using the Highway 25 bridge to avoid traffic on other bridges, prices are increasing by 26% all at once and the Minister of Transport seems to find that normal. The truth is that the Liberal government has abandoned the citizens of the North Shore, ”added Mathieu Traversy.
“Minister Poëti even tried to justify this increase by invoking the improvement in the flow of traffic on the bridge. Does he realize that by reasoning in this way, he is creating two categories of bridges: one fluid bridge for those able to pay a high price, and other congested bridges for the middle class? », Concluded Martine Ouellet.
