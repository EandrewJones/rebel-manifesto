Saguenay - As they had undertaken to do last summer, the Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, and Member of Parliament for Jonquière, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, and the President of the Treasury Board, Minister responsible for the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region and MP for Chicoutimi, Stéphane Bédard, today presented the 2014-2019 action plan for the Dubuc Bridge and its approaches.
This plan confirms the priority given to user safety and the desire to improve the fluidity of travel between the two shores of the Saguenay. The main elements are as follows:
“Our plan clearly demonstrates the government&#39;s commitment to the people of the region. The large-scale work, estimated at $ 45 million, will bring about considerable improvements to the Dubuc Bridge, a solid and high-quality infrastructure that is at the heart of our daily activities, ”declared Minister Gaudreault.
“Beyond the major work that will be carried out by 2019, through this plan we are giving ourselves all the elements to meet the needs of the population for several decades,” said Minister Bédard.
The work, which will begin next spring, will focus this year on repairing the foundations, repairing slabs and bearings. The public will be informed of the content and planning of the work in order to minimize their impact on traffic. The Department will also work in close collaboration with the City of Saguenay.
“The action plan is a tangible example of the government&#39;s desire to provide a safe road network that is in line with the needs of the population. Investments in the Dubuc Bridge respect our commitments and will at the same time contribute to the prosperity of our region, ”concluded Minister Sylvain Gaudreault.
