Quebec - The MP for Gouin and official opposition spokesperson for transport, Nicolas Girard, strongly denounces the statements of the Minister of Transport, Sam Hamad, who said in the daily edition of The Gazette on Thursday, June 30 that he refused to make public inspection reports on the condition of the Mercier Bridge because Quebeckers would not understand them.
“Traffic between the Island of Montreal and the South Shore has become hell for thousands of motorists and truckers. Everything indicates that the problems will last for months if not years and that this will have considerable economic impacts. The minister should demonstrate transparency and not paternalism and contempt, ”declared Nicolas Girard.
“Faced with this attitude of the Liberal government, Quebeckers are entitled to ask questions. Does the Minister of Transport have anything to hide? If not, why play hide and seek? Asked the member of the Parti Québécois.
“Mr. Hamad must recover as quickly as possible, assume his responsibilities and systematically make public all inspection reports that lead to emergency road section closures. The farce has gone on long enough. Quebecers have the right to know, ”said the member for Gouin.
It is not only in the Mercier Bridge file that the Minister of Transport lacks transparency. For months, Minister Hamad has refused to make public a pre-feasibility study on the construction of a new Champlain Bridge, the cost of which has been assumed 40% by the government of Quebec, despite repeated requests from the opposition. official and Liberal MP Fatima Houda-Pepin.
