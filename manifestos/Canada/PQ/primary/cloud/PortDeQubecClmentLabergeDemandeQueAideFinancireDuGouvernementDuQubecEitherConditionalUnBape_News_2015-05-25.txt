Quebec - The Parti Québécois candidate in the riding of Jean-Talon, Clément Laberge, and the Member of Parliament for Taschereau and official opposition spokesperson for the Capitale-Nationale region, Agnès Maltais, ask that the government funding of $ 35 million dedicated to the Port of Quebec is conditional on the holding of a BAPE.
“The Port of Quebec file took pride of place in the by-elections. Following pressure from Clément, the Quebec government agreed to hold a BAPE on the expansion project. However, this idea was rejected out of hand by the Port of Quebec. The government still has one option, which has agreed to finance the Port project to the tune of $ 35 million: that this financial assistance be conditional on the holding of a BAPE. Never has a Quebec government invested in a port facility. Accepting the BAPE to look into the matter would be a gesture of goodwill on the part of the Port. If they want the project to succeed, and in the interest of the population, the partners must trust each other, ”said Agnès Maltais.
“This major project will affect the quality of life of hundreds of citizens of Jean-Talon, but it could see the light of day regardless of their questions or concerns about their safety. The liberal candidate, Sébastien Proulx, recognizes the danger linked to the increase in rail activity, but he refuses to comment on the question. In this case, as in many others, his hands are tied. I ask him to take a stand. We hope for the development of the Port of Quebec, but only after a credible and independent process of consulting citizens, ”concluded Clément Laberge.
