Quebec - The Minister responsible for Democratic Institutions and Citizen Participation, Bernard Drainville, has decided, for security reasons, to cancel his participation in a debate on the Quebec Charter of Values, which was to be held this noon, at the &#39;Concordia University. The event organized by the Graduate Student Association and on the Quebec Charter of Values was to bring together Minister Drainville, Liberal MP, Kathleen Weil, and André Frappier from Québec Solidaire.
For the occasion, an invitation to demonstrate against the charter was launched on social networks. The organizers of this event did not rule out wanting to “disrupt” the event or even prevent it from taking place. In light of this information, the minister&#39;s office wanted to ensure that Concordia University could guarantee the safety of both those attending the debate and that of the panelists. However, the University has been unable to offer these guarantees of security. In such circumstances, Bernard Drainville deemed it preferable to cancel his participation.
“Since the beginning of the debate on the Quebec charter of values, I have always said that the tone would be as important as the substance and that we should debate while respecting the opinions of all. However, we see here a group of people who threaten to disrupt the conduct of the debate in order to deprive us of a democratic discussion. I sincerely regret this situation, ”said Bernard Drainville. &quot;I have taken the decision not to participate in the debate in order to avoid unsightly incidents tarnishing the discussion around the charter, a discussion which has so far taken place for the most part in calm, tolerance and the respect. &quot;
