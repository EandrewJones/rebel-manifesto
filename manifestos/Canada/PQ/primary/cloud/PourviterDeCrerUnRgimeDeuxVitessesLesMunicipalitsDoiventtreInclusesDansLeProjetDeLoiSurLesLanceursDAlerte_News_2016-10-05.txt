Quebec - The member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois for the Treasury Board, Nicole Léger, denounces the stubbornness of the government, which refuses to include the municipalities in Bill 87, An Act to facilitate the disclosure of wrongdoing in public bodies.
“Last Thursday during question period, we asked the government to confirm that municipal employees would be protected. Ministers Carlos Leitão, Jean-Marc Fournier and Martin Coiteux responded to me in turn that, indeed, the municipalities were included in Bill 87, which was already a flip-flop on their part. However, the next day at the end of the day, the government saw fit to point out that the municipalities would rather be subject to another bill. What improvisation, what scattering and what inconsistency on the part of the government! », Indignant the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles.
“Let us remember the recommendations of the Charbonneau commission regarding the adoption of a general protection regime for whistleblowers; twenty-five of them concern municipalities. We have been insisting for months with Minister Carlos Leitão but, each time, he refers us to his colleague from Municipal Affairs, who is supposed to table a bill soon… but which we are still waiting for, ”continued the spokesperson.
“Many groups have spoken out in favor of municipalities being included in Bill 87. It is absolutely necessary to protect people who denounce, it is in the public interest. It is not normal that so many workers are neither protected nor supported. If the bill is not as inclusive as possible, whistleblowers could remain silent for fear of reprisals that could go as far as dismissal, ”concluded Nicole Léger.
