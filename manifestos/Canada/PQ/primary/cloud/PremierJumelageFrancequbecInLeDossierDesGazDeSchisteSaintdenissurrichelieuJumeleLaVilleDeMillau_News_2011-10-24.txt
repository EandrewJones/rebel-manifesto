The Presentation - “The Municipality of Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu in Montérégie and the City of Millau in France become partners in the issue of shale gas. This is a unique opportunity for the exchange of expertise and a unique bridge to discuss the respective realities of two municipalities grappling with similar issues regarding the exploration and exploitation of shale gas ”, s &#39;is delighted the member for Vachon and official opposition critic for mines and shale gas, Martine Ouellet.
The mayor of Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu, Jacques Villemaire, is thrilled by this twinning. &quot;The exchanges that will take place between our two municipalities can only improve our knowledge of this sector and strengthen our conviction to protect our water, our air and our environment,&quot; he declared.
“I congratulate the Municipality of Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu for this agreement with the City of Millau in France. Just like us, several French localities fear the presence of the shale gas industry in their backyards. The risks associated with this industry are enormous and information sharing is the key in a context where the government is leading its boat without worrying too much about the legitimate fears of the population! », Concluded the Member of Parliament for Verchères, Stéphane Bergeron.
It was in March 2011 that the Parti Québécois, supported by José Bové, announced a twinning between Quebec and France to follow up the citizen mobilization stimulated by concerns surrounding the exploitation of shale gas.
