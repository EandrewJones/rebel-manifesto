Mirabel - The Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, and the Minister of Finance and the Economy, Nicolas Marceau, today participated in the start of construction of the first North American plant of Aerolia. This project represents investments of more than $ 82.4 million, and will create more than 170 jobs.
&quot;It is with pride that my government welcomes this major French manufacturer of aircraft fuselage components to Quebec,&quot; said Pauline Marois. Under a 15-year agreement with Aéroports de Montréal, Aerolia will establish, at Montréal-Mirabel airport, its first North American fuselage factory as well as the head office of its Canadian subsidiary. Aerolia brings strategic expertise that will benefit our aerospace industry, which is already among the leaders in innovation and technology internationally. The arrival of Aerolia in Quebec also opens up a substantial market for Quebec companies, which means major spinoffs for our economy. &quot;
