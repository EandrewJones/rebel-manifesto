Quebec— The Minister of Public Security, Stéphane Bergeron, today tabled a bill to determine the registration rules for non-restricted firearms in Quebec, commonly known as long guns. These represent more than 90% of all firearms currently registered in Quebec.
By presenting Bill 20, the Quebec government is laying the foundations for the establishment of a Quebec registry of non-restricted firearms.
“Keeping such a register and consulting it are extremely useful in emergency situations, among others, in matters of domestic violence, suicide prevention, trafficking or smuggling of weapons, the taking of &#39;hostage. This is to support peace officers in their investigation and field operations. If only one life can be saved, it is our duty to act, ”declared Minister Bergeron, accompanied by spokespersons for opposition parties, various groups supporting the registry and police representatives.
The presentation of this bill responds to the unanimous will of the National Assembly expressed on December 6 and to the commitment of the Premier of Quebec to this effect, made during the presentation of the Council of Ministers and the opening speech.
It should be remembered that this project demonstrates the determination of the Government of Quebec to fully assume its powers in the administration of justice as well as property and civil rights in its territory.
