Montreal - The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, accompanied by the Mayor of Montreal, Mr. Denis Coderre, and the Mayor of Longueuil, Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire , met with the members of the Mobilité Montréal steering committee to coordinate efforts to mitigate the effects on traffic of the closure of a lane on the Champlain Bridge.
This morning&#39;s meeting made it possible to decide on the short-term implementation of twelve traffic management and public transport measures in order to ensure the fluidity of travel between the South Shore and Montreal.
The proposed measures will be reassessed on a regular basis to provide solutions to problematic areas.
The Minister and the Mobility Montreal partners wish to remind road users that they can use the Champlain Bridge in complete safety. The Jacques Cartier and Champlain Bridges Incorporated ensures that all the necessary work will be carried out, as quickly as possible, in order to allow the right lane to be reopened in complete safety.
Everyone is part of the solution In order to facilitate the mobility of people and goods in the coming weeks, everyone&#39;s collaboration is requested. Public transit and carpooling therefore represent winning solutions to facilitate travel between the South Shore and Montreal.
Regularly consult the Mobility Montreal section of the sitequebec511.info to follow the implementation and range of measures in place and thus better plan your trips.
