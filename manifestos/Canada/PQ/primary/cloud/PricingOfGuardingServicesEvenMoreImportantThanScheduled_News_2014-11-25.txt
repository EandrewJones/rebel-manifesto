Quebec - The member for Rousseau and official opposition critic for finances and income, Nicolas Marceau, deplores the improvisation of the Liberal government in the matter of the tariffs of childcare services. First, he broke his promise, made during the election campaign, to only index tariffs. Then, we learn that nothing has been formally agreed with Ottawa on the inclusion of federal tax credits.
“To get rid of the tariff shock pill that it will impose on middle-class families, the government has indicated that it will give them the right to tax credits for federal child care expenses. However, we learned this morning that the Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, has nothing to do with Ottawa. So he improvised and once again embarrassed his Prime Minister by making him promise highly speculative amounts. This government has broken its promise, it will tax families and, in addition, it says anything to the population, ”declared Nicolas Marceau.
The MP recalled that several tax experts believe that the part of the amount invoiced to parents for childcare services through their income tax returns would not be eligible for federal tax credits. Asked about this, the minister admitted that he had nothing to do with Ottawa, adding that he did not have to.
“For a family, in addition to the increase announced by the government, this could mean an additional sum of more than $ 1,000. How can the government present increases reduced by tax credits, when formally nothing is planned? What should families do? Provide a large family tax or a very large family tax? », Nicolas Marceau concluded.
