Gatineau– The Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, was visiting the Gatineau Chamber of Commerce today, along with the Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Seniors, Réjean Hébert, and the Minister of Public security and Minister responsible for the Outaouais region, Stéphane Bergeron. She announced that her government will contribute to the Canadian Francophone Games, which will be held in Gatineau from July 23 to 27, 2014.
“I am happy to confirm that we support these games. This is a healthy competition that highlights the talent of young people and at the same time reaffirms the Quebec identity within the large Francophone community. This allows young people to open their horizons, to surpass themselves, to deliver the best of themselves, both intellectually and physically. This is a fine example of what our teenagers are capable of: discipline, performance and, of course, friendship, ”said Pauline Marois.
The Canadian Francophone Games are one of the largest gatherings of Francophone youth in Canada. This is the sixth edition of the event, which brings together a thousand young people aged 13 to 18 from coast to coast. Evaluations will focus on their performance in the arts and sports, as well as their talents as leaders. Government financial assistance will amount to $ 472,500.
