Quebec - Diane Lamarre, MP for Taillon and official opposition spokesperson for health and access to care, believes that it is high time that Philippe Couillard demanded the resignation of his Minister of Education , Leisure and Sport, Yves Bolduc.
“According to information published in the media yesterday, Yves Bolduc would be one of the 14 doctors who received the most lucrative bonuses resulting from this measure, which places him among the most privileged 0.3%. Remember that 5,400 doctors received a premium thanks to the letter of understanding no. 245, set up by Yves Bolduc himself. This incentive will have cost the Quebec government more than $ 72 million since 2011, ”said Diane Lamarre.
“We also note that the average premium received by physicians in all regions of Quebec is around $ 13,000. Yves Bolduc therefore pocketed more than 16 times the average bonus. The minister had the opportunity to give his bonus of $ 215,000 back to Quebeckers in full, but by refusing, he showed that he did not understand the real nature of his fault. His decision inexorably condemns him today to having to resign. He obviously did not grasp the ethical issue of his deviations, ”she added.
The member indicates that the situation is better understood by observing that of other doctors who are not, however, also members of Parliament. The minister has shown either a blatant lack of ethics or a serious lack of judgment. If the Prime Minister accepts his behavior, then it is permissible to question the promise of integrity he made to Quebeckers.
“To have, by his choices, taken advantage of this program by not respecting his commitments to vulnerable patients, Yves Bolduc must reimburse his premium in full and resign. Otherwise, the Prime Minister must take the only necessary decision: request the departure of his minister, ”concluded Diane Lamarre.
