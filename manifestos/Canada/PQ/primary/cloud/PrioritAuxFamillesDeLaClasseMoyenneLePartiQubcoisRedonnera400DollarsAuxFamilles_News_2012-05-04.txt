Quebec - &quot;A government of the Parti Québécois will abolish the health tax and give back to Quebec families the $ 400 that the Liberals of Jean Charest took from them, who have overtaxed the middle class in recent years,&quot; said at the outset. Member of Parliament for Taschereau and Official Opposition Health Critic, Agnès Maltais.
&quot;We want to restore economic justice in Quebec,&quot; continued the member for Rousseau and finance critic, Nicolas Marceau. “This health tax is an illustration of a lack of courage on the part of the Liberal Party, which has chosen to bill all Quebecers regardless of their income. The poorest and middle class families are penalized and it is unfair. &quot;
The solution proposed by the Parti Québécois does not represent any additional expense for the government. Indeed, richer people will be put to greater use, they who had been less affected by the effort to return to a balanced budget and who had benefited from tax cuts for which we did not have the means in 2007. We will indeed put in place a new tax system that will restore a better balance in the tax system. With the Parti Québécois, it is the taxpayers who earn more than $ 130,000 and especially those who earn more than $ 250,000 who will make the bulk of the effort. We also propose to review the taxation applicable to part of the return on certain financial assets. Our solution, I repeat, is at zero cost, ”continued Nicolas Marceau.
The fate of Quebec women is also at the heart of the Parti Québécois&#39; priorities. As they are more affected by poverty, women are directly penalized by the liberal health tax. “For a single mother, $ 200 at the end of the year makes all the difference. But that seems like the Liberals are not thinking about it. We care about the good of women, we care about the good of the middle class, which is why we will abolish this unjust tax, ”concluded Marguerite-D&#39;Youville MNA Monique Richard.
