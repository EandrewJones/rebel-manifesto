Quebec - The member for Taillon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of health and access to care, Diane Lamarre, together with the president of the Association des couples infertiles du Québec, Ms. Céline Braun, denounced the privatization of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and all the obstacles infertile couples have had to overcome since the adoption of Bill 20.
“We have before us a government that has chosen to privatize in vitro fertilization, thus denying access to all couples who do not have the means to pay the $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 required. What is only mathematical for the minister translates into real human despair. Since November 10, it has been injustice and chaos for infertile couples, ”lamented Diane Lamarre.
The MP reported heartbreaking cases, including that of a woman whose ectopic pregnancy counted as one pregnancy, which automatically excluded her from the reimbursement program. For another woman, the drugs were not available in the region, which prevented her from having access to her prescription before November 10, and therefore from continuing her treatments as planned.
“The minister&#39;s choices are inhumane. There is a flagrant lack of compassion within this government. Today we were treated to an opening start from the minister, but he refused to make a commitment, despite the promise he had made, that all couples who had started an IVF cycle , including those cited as an example, can sue him. Infertile couples feel not only abandoned by the minister, but also despised and deceived, ”lamented the member.
