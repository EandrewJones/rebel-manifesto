Quebec - The member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, underlines the fact that in the matter of the privatization of state corporations, Premier Philippe Couillard completely disowned two of his ministers, that of Finance , Carlos Leitão, and that of the Economy, Jacques Daoust.
“While in Quebec, he claimed the opposite, the Minister of Finance clearly mentioned the privatization of our state corporations in front of brokers to whom he was trying to sell Quebec bonds. This is the third time in just a year that the Liberal government has let this rumor run wild, especially about Hydro-Québec. The prime minister then rebuked Carlos Leitão saying there was no plan to privatize assets. Can he call his ministers to order and prevent them from thinking about their aspirations out loud? Their aims are obviously not those of Quebecers, nor even those of Philippe Couillard, ”said Stéphane Bédard.
The Minister of Finance is not the only member of the government to make sweeping statements; indeed, as recently as today, Minister Jacques Daoust wondered aloud in front of an audience of journalists: &quot;Is it the role of the state to manage casinos?&quot; This is a question we can ask ourselves. &quot;
“It is therefore a new disavowal on the part of the Prime Minister, who had to be transparent with Quebeckers. The privatization of state-owned companies is not a solution to improve public finances in the long term. These companies belong to all Quebecers, and they have the right to know what the government intends to do with them, ”concluded the leader of the official opposition.
