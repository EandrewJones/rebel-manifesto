Quebec - More than three months after having made the request, the Parti Québécois is back to have the government consider setting a ceiling price for the price of gasoline.
“As the holiday season is in full swing, the price of gasoline is rising by 7 or 10 cents a liter, without any intelligent and valid explanation. To avoid such shocks to motorists, the Charest government must draw inspiration from what is being done elsewhere, such as in New Brunswick or Nova Scotia, where the price of gasoline is stable and lower, ”declared the Minister. member for La Prairie and official opposition critic for consumer protection, François Rebello.
Last May, the Parti Québécois invited the Government of Quebec to study this proposal. The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, affirmed that her department as well as the Régie de l&#39;énergie were working on the analysis of this idea and would do so promptly.
MP Rebello criticizes Minister Normandeau for taking up the argument of the oil companies rather than the consumers. “This is a proposal that has merit and that has stabilized prices in the Maritime provinces for years. If it&#39;s good for them, why wouldn&#39;t it be good for Quebec motorists? He asks himself, recalling that this ceiling price proposal obtains the support of the Union des consommateurs and the Quebec Association of Petroleum Independents. Note that a Quebec family will have to pay an additional amount of approximately $ 1,000 this year, compared to last year, if the price of gasoline remains around $ 1.40 / liter.
“As with the electrification of transportation, the Liberal government is being lax about the price of oil. As long as we do not free ourselves from oil, we must take all means to help Quebec motorists who are currently victims of a price per liter of gasoline more expensive than elsewhere. This is what we expect from a government that cares about consumers, not oil companies, ”concluded François Rebello.
