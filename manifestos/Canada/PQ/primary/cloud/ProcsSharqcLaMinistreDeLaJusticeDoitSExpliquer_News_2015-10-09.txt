Quebec - As we learn today that the legal proceedings against five motorcyclists accused in the context of Operation SharQc have been stopped, the spokespersons of the Parti Québécois in matters of justice and public security, Stéphane Bédard and Pascal Bérubé , ask the Minister of Justice, Stéphanie Vallée, to reassure the population and provide explanations as to the reasons which led the judge to make this decision.
This episode follows the release, in 2011, of 31 of the 156 co-accused of Operation SharQc. &quot;The Minister of Justice must shed light on the events that led to this disappointing result,&quot; said Stéphane Bédard.
&quot;I have a thought for the police officers who have devoted themselves body and soul to put together a solid case so that charges are laid against these dangerous individuals, and who, today, see the risk that their efforts will be reduced to nothing&quot; , added Pascal Bérubé.
This news comes just as we recently learned that the Liberal government has decided to cut 40% of the posts of prosecutors fighting against organized crime. In addition, the pledge of reinvestment in the resources of the Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions, made in 2012, has never been honored. The reduction in the workforce is therefore very real. “There is no compromise that can be made with regard to the means available to prosecutors. This is the conclusion reached by the former Minister of Justice, Jean-Marc Fournier, when the judicial proceedings were stopped in 2011. Four years later, we demand that Minister Vallée provide explanations to Quebecers and that it act with diligence in the case of mega-trials, ”concluded Stéphane Bédard.
