Quebec– Sylvain Roy, MP for Bonaventure and official opposition spokesperson for forests, deplores the Liberal government&#39;s inaction on the closure of machine number 9 at the Resolute Forest Products plant in Alma, where 85 workers will lose their jobs as of April 1.
“It is a real tragedy which still shakes the forest sector. The government had a good opportunity to intervene to bring together the various players and thus prevent a shutdown that will send 85 workers out of work. Unfortunately, he did not respond to the region&#39;s distress call and today we are faced with significant job losses. Once again, it is the regions of Quebec that are hit hard, ”said Sylvain Roy.
The member for Bonaventure urges the Minister of Forests, Laurent Lessard, to bring together the various stakeholders in the Quebec forest in order to avoid further plant closures in the regions of Quebec.
“If the government is serious, it will very quickly convene forest stakeholders in order to find solutions that will allow the forest industry to remain competitive. He must defend the forest regions and maintain jobs here in Quebec. The community is worried and the Minister has a duty to reassure the families who live from the forest, ”added Sylvain Roy.
