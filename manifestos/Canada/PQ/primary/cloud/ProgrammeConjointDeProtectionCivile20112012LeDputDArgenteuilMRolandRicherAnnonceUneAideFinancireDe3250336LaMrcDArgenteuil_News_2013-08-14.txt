Quebec - The deputy for Argenteuil, Mr. Roland Richer, announces, on behalf of the Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, financial assistance of $ 32,503.36 to the MRC d&#39;Argenteuil under the Joint Program of civil protection (PCPC) 2011-2012.
“The MRC d&#39;Argenteuil is benefiting from this financial assistance for the project allowing it to acquire a generator and to set up a rest room for the regional coordination center, and thus to cope with possible disasters with more than &#39;efficiency,&#39; said Richer.
The generator and interactive television connected to the MRC&#39;s computer network facilitate communications and allow, in particular, the projection of cartographic data, access to decision-making tools and the holding of teleconferences.
“We are proud to support the municipalities that put in place measures to prevent a disaster from occurring or, where applicable, to facilitate the return to normal life of victims affected by such circumstances. I would like to underline the efforts made by the MRC d&#39;Argenteuil to ensure the safety of the citizens of the region, ”said Minister Bergeron.
Remember that the PCPC is a federal program aimed at municipalities, regional county municipalities, metropolitan communities as well as departments and agencies of the Government of Quebec. This program, under the responsibility of Public Safety Canada, is administered in Quebec by the Ministère de la Sécurité publique. It aims to encourage efforts to improve and increase emergency response capacity through civil protection projects.
