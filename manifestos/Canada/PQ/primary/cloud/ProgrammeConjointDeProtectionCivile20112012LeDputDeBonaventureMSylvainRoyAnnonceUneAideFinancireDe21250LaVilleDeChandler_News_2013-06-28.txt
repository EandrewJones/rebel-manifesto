Quebec - The MNA for Bonaventure, Mr. Sylvain Roy, on behalf of the Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, submitted financial assistance of $ 21,250 to the City of Chandler under the Joint Civil Protection Program ( PCPC) 2011-2012.
&quot;The Town of Chandler is benefiting from this financial assistance for the project, allowing it to acquire a search and rescue boat, and thus to deal with possible disasters more efficiently,&quot; said Mr. Roy.
This project will make it possible to intervene with boaters who have broken down or who are ill, or during nautical activities, rescue operations for kayakers and search for people.
“We are proud to support the municipalities that put in place measures to prevent a disaster from occurring or, where applicable, to facilitate the return to normal life of victims affected by such circumstances. I would like to underline the efforts made by the City of Chandler to ensure the safety of the citizens of the region, ”said Minister Bergeron.
Remember that the PCPC is a federal program aimed at municipalities, regional county municipalities, metropolitan communities as well as departments and agencies of the Government of Quebec. This program, under the responsibility of Public Safety Canada, is administered in Quebec by the Ministère de la Sécurité publique. It aims to encourage efforts to improve and increase emergency response capacity through civil protection projects.
