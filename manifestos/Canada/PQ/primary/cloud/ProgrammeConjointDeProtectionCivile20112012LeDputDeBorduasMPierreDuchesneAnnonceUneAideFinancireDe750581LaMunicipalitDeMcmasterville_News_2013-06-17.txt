Quebec - The member for Borduas, Mr. Pierre Duchesne, on behalf of the Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, submitted financial assistance of $ 7,505.81 to the Municipality of McMasterville under the Joint Protection Program Civilian (PCPC) 2011-2012.
&quot;The Municipality of McMasterville is benefiting from this financial assistance for the project allowing it to acquire a generator for the mobile emergency operation center, and thus to face possible disasters with more efficiency&quot;, said Mr. Duchesne. This project will ensure the safety of the population in the event of a disaster, loss of power, or if the place of the incident is a hostile environment where the usual services are absent.
“We are proud to support the municipalities that put in place measures to prevent a disaster from occurring or, where applicable, to facilitate the return to normal life of victims affected by such circumstances. I would like to underline the efforts made by the Municipality of McMasterville to ensure the safety of the citizens of the region, ”said Minister Bergeron.
Remember that the PCPC is a federal program aimed at municipalities, regional county municipalities, metropolitan communities as well as departments and agencies of the Government of Quebec. This program, under the responsibility of Public Safety Canada, is administered in Quebec by the Ministère de la Sécurité publique. It aims to encourage efforts to improve and increase emergency response capacity through civil protection projects.
