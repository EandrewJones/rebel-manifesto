Quebec - The member for Borduas, Mr. Pierre Duchesne, on behalf of the Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, submitted financial assistance of $ 9,245.56 to the City of Beloeil under the Joint Protection Program Civilian (PCPC) 2011-2012.
&quot;The City of Beloeil is benefiting from this financial assistance for the project, allowing it to acquire a thermal camera, and thus to deal with possible disasters more efficiently,&quot; said Mr. Duchesne.
This equipment will make search and rescue operations even more efficient and rapid.
“We are proud to support the municipalities that put in place measures to prevent a disaster from occurring or, where applicable, to facilitate the return to normal life of victims affected by such circumstances. I would like to underline the efforts made by the City of Beloeil to ensure the safety of the citizens of the region, ”said Minister Bergeron.
Remember that the PCPC is a federal program aimed at municipalities, regional county municipalities, metropolitan communities as well as departments and agencies of the Government of Quebec. This program, under the responsibility of Public Safety Canada, is administered in Quebec by the Ministère de la Sécurité publique. It aims to encourage efforts to improve and increase emergency response capacity through civil protection projects.
