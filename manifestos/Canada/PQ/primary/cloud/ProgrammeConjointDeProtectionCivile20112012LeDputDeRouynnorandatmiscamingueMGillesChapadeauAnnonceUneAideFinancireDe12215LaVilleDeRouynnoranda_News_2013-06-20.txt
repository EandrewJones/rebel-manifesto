Quebec - The MNA for Rouyn-Noranda-Témiscamingue, Mr. Gilles Chapadeau, on behalf of the Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, presented financial assistance of $ 12,215 to the City of Rouyn-Noranda under the terms of the Joint Emergency Preparedness Program (JEPP) 2011-2012.
&quot;The City of Rouyn-Noranda is benefiting from this financial assistance for the project, allowing it to offer civil protection training, and thus to deal with possible disasters more effectively,&quot; said Mr. Chapadeau. This project will allow targeted personnel to better understand their role in the context of emergency measures and to be better equipped for the future.
“We are proud to support the municipalities that put in place measures to prevent a disaster from occurring or, where applicable, to facilitate the return to normal life of victims affected by such circumstances. I would like to underline the efforts made by the City of Rouyn-Noranda to ensure the safety of the citizens of the region, ”said Minister Bergeron.
Remember that the PCPC is a federal program aimed at municipalities, regional county municipalities, metropolitan communities as well as departments and agencies of the Government of Quebec. This program, under the responsibility of Public Safety Canada, is administered in Quebec by the Ministère de la Sécurité publique. It aims to encourage efforts to improve and increase emergency response capacity through civil protection projects.
