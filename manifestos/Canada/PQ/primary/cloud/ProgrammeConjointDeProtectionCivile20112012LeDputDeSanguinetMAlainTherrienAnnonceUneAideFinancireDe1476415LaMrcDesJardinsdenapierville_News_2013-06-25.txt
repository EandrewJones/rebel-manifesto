&quot;The Jardins-de-Napierville RCM is benefiting from this financial assistance for the project, allowing it to acquire a mobile command post, and thus to deal with possible disasters more efficiently,&quot; said Mr. Therrien.
This vehicle will be able to provide significant support during critical events and will be available to local municipalities.
“We are proud to support the municipalities that put in place measures to prevent a disaster from occurring or, where applicable, to facilitate the return to normal life of victims affected by such circumstances. I would like to underline the efforts made by the MRC des Jardins-de-Napierville to ensure the safety of the citizens of the region, ”said Minister Bergeron.
Remember that the PCPC is a federal program aimed at municipalities, regional county municipalities, metropolitan communities as well as departments and agencies of the Government of Quebec. This program, under the responsibility of Public Safety Canada, is administered in Quebec by the Ministère de la Sécurité publique. It aims to encourage efforts to improve and increase emergency response capacity through civil protection projects.
