Quebec - The Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, gave financial assistance of $ 9,577.52 to the City of Longueuil under the 2011-2012 Joint Emergency Preparedness Program (PCPC).
&quot;The City of Longueuil is benefiting from this financial assistance for the project, allowing it to offer civil protection training, and thus to deal with possible disasters more effectively,&quot; declared Mr. Bergeron.
This project will allow the municipal agglomerations of each of the related cities as well as the agglomeration of Longueuil to better understand the importance of civil security and to be better prepared.
“We are proud to support the municipalities that put in place measures to prevent a disaster from occurring or, where applicable, to facilitate the return to normal life of victims affected by such circumstances. I would like to underline the efforts made by Ville de Longueuil to ensure the safety of the citizens of the region, ”added the Minister.
Remember that the PCPC is a federal program aimed at municipalities, regional county municipalities, metropolitan communities as well as departments and agencies of the Government of Quebec. This program, under the responsibility of Public Safety Canada, is administered in Quebec by the Ministère de la Sécurité publique. It aims to encourage efforts to improve and increase emergency response capacity through civil protection projects.
