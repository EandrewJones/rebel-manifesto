Quebec - The Minister responsible for the Mauricie region and the Center-du-Québec region, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet, announces, on behalf of the Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, financial assistance of 9 $ 617.83 to the City of Saint-Tite under the 2011-2012 Joint Emergency Preparedness Program (PCPC).
&quot;The City of Saint-Tite is benefiting from this financial assistance for the project, allowing it to set up a coordination center, and thus to deal with possible disasters more efficiently,&quot; declared Mr. Blanchet.
This project will allow rapid communication with local stakeholders and ministries of different levels of government, such as civil protection, the environment and transport. The coordination of actions and interventions will be facilitated since the material and human resources will be brought together in one place.
“We are proud to support the municipalities that put in place measures to prevent a disaster from occurring or, where applicable, to facilitate the return to normal life of victims affected by such circumstances. I would like to underline the efforts made by the City of Saint-Tite to ensure the safety of the citizens of the region, ”said Minister Bergeron.
Remember that the PCPC is a federal program aimed at municipalities, regional county municipalities, metropolitan communities as well as departments and agencies of the Government of Quebec. This program, under the responsibility of Public Safety Canada, is administered in Quebec by the Ministère de la Sécurité publique. It aims to encourage efforts to improve and increase emergency response capacity through civil protection projects.
