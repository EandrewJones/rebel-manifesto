Quebec - The Minister responsible for the Bas-Saint-Laurent region, Mr. Pascal Bérubé, on behalf of the Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, provided financial assistance of $ 11,619.71 to the Régie intermunicipale in fire protection of Kamouraska Ouest under the Joint Civil Protection Program (PCPC) 2011-2012.
&quot;The Intermunicipal board of fire protection of Kamouraska Ouest benefits from this financial assistance for the project allowing it to acquire rescue equipment, and thus to face possible disasters with more efficiency&quot;, declared Mr. Bérubé.
This project will make it possible, among other things, to carry out rescues in the forest or in other places that are difficult to access.
“We are proud to support the municipalities that put in place measures to prevent a disaster from occurring or, where applicable, to facilitate the return to normal life of victims affected by such circumstances. I would like to underline the efforts made by the Intermunicipal board for fire protection of Kamouraska Ouest to ensure the safety of the citizens of the region, ”said Minister Bergeron.
Remember that the PCPC is a federal program aimed at municipalities, regional county municipalities, metropolitan communities as well as departments and agencies of the Government of Quebec. This program, under the responsibility of Public Safety Canada, is administered in Quebec by the Ministère de la Sécurité publique. It aims to encourage efforts to improve and increase emergency response capacity through civil protection projects.
