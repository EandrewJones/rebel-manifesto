Quebec - The Minister responsible for the Bas-Saint-Laurent region, Mr. Pascal Bérubé, on behalf of the Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, presented financial assistance of $ 1,800.04 to the MRC de La Mitis under the Joint Emergency Preparedness Program (JEPP) 2011-2012.
&quot;The MRC de La Mitis is benefiting from this financial assistance for the project, allowing it to acquire a deployment kit, and thus to deal with possible disasters more effectively,&quot; said Mr. Bérubé.
This kit will make it possible to intervene effectively throughout the territory of the MRC de La Mitis.
“We are proud to support the municipalities that put in place measures to prevent a disaster from occurring or, where applicable, to facilitate the return to normal life of victims affected by such circumstances. I would like to underline the efforts made by the MRC de La Mitis to ensure the safety of the citizens of the region, ”said Minister Bergeron.
Remember that the PCPC is a federal program aimed at municipalities, regional county municipalities, metropolitan communities as well as departments and agencies of the Government of Quebec. This program, under the responsibility of Public Safety Canada, is administered in Quebec by the Ministère de la Sécurité publique. It aims to encourage efforts to improve and increase emergency response capacity through civil protection projects.
