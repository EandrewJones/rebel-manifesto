Quebec - The government official for the Laurentides region and Member of Parliament for Labelle, Mr. Sylvain Pagé, on behalf of the Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, presented financial assistance of $ 23,353.79 to the City of Boisbriand under the 2011-2012 Joint Emergency Preparedness Program (JEPP).
&quot;The City of Boisbriand is benefiting from this financial assistance for the project, allowing it to revise the municipal civil protection plan, and thus deal with possible disasters more effectively,&quot; declared Mr. Pagé.
This project will allow city workers to be better equipped to intervene in an exceptional situation.
“We are proud to support the municipalities that put in place measures to prevent a disaster from occurring or, where applicable, to facilitate the return to normal life of victims affected by such circumstances. I would like to underline the efforts made by the City of Boisbriand to ensure the safety of the citizens of the region, ”said Minister Bergeron.
Remember that the PCPC is a federal program aimed at municipalities, regional county municipalities, metropolitan communities as well as departments and agencies of the Government of Quebec. This program, under the responsibility of Public Safety Canada, is administered in Quebec by the Ministère de la Sécurité publique. It aims to encourage efforts to improve and increase emergency response capacity through civil protection projects.
