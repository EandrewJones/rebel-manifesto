Quebec– The MP for Bonaventure and official opposition spokesperson for forests, Sylvain Roy, strongly denounces the draconian cut of nearly $ 10 million in the Sustainable Forest Management Program. These cuts are once again hitting the forestry economy in the regions of Quebec with full force.
“This program, which allowed forestry workers across Quebec to finance specific forestry projects and encouraged regional cooperation, has been cut by more than half of its budget. Indeed, it goes from $ 17 million to $ 8 million, which is a real tragedy for the forest economy. The Liberal government is continuing its work of destructuring the regions of Quebec. Not only did it abolish, in the spring, consultation tools such as the regional conferences of elected officials, which financed promising projects in collaboration with the community, but in addition it cut the budgets intended for the development of forest resources by more than 50%. It is unacceptable, ”said Sylvain Roy.
The member for Bonaventure also denounces the negative consequences for forest owners who are once again affected by the Liberal government&#39;s cuts.
“Part of the budgets for this program helped private forest owners manage their forest lots. After having seen the Forest Job Creation Program and the Silvicultural Investment Program be abolished, once again, we are abandoning the owners of private forests who instead need a helping hand to stimulate their business environment, ”concluded the Member for Bonaventure.
