Piedmont - The Member for Bertrand and Vice-President of the National Assembly, Mr. Claude Cousineau, on behalf of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Minister of Transport and Member for Jonquière, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, is pleased to announce that the Municipality of Piedmont will receive a financial contribution of $ 2,006,000 for the replacement of drinking water pipes. This assistance is granted under the Quebec-Municipalities Infrastructure Program (PIQM).
More specifically, the project aims to replace drinking water pipes under Beausoleil, Belvédère, de la Corniche, du Cap and des Pignons roads. At the end of this work, drinking water pipes over nearly two and a half kilometers will be renewed.
“I am very happy with the financial support granted to the Municipality of Piedmont. Our government recognizes the need to renew and develop drinking water, wastewater and stormwater infrastructure in communities across Quebec. This is why, in partnership with the municipalities, we want to ensure that citizens benefit from quality sustainable public services for current and future generations, ”said MP Cousineau.
&quot;It is with great pleasure that I learned that the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, responded to our request for a grant for the establishment of an aqueduct network in the Mont-Belvédère sector, because this sector is currently served by high density polyethylene pipes of very small diameters and located behind the lots. », Declared the mayor of Piedmont, Clément Cardin.
Completion of this project requires maximum government financial assistance of $ 2,006,000, under component 1.5 of the PIQM. With a total envelope of $ 462 million, this new component not only ensures the sustainability of infrastructure, but also improves the quality of life of the population and creates many jobs in all regions of the Quebec.
The Quebec government&#39;s support for this project is part of the 2013-2023 Quebec Infrastructure Plan (PQI) made public in April 2013. It should be remembered that this ten-year plan will ultimately result in investments of $ 8.1 billion. dollars for the municipal infrastructure component. It will have a major economic impact throughout Quebec, with nearly 60,000 jobs created or maintained on average per year.
The PQI also marks a shift in the way we invest and manage public infrastructure. This new way of doing things will make it possible to prospectively assess the needs, based on the priorities of Quebecers, to properly measure the costs associated with them and thus to make informed choices.
