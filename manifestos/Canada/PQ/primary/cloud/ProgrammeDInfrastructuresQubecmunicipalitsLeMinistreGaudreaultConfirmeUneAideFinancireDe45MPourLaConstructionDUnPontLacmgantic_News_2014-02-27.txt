Lac-Mégantic– The Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, is pleased to confirm the financial assistance of $ 4.5 million granted by the Government of Quebec for construction work on the new Lac-Mégantic bridge.
“The financial assistance confirmed today shows that our government is continuing its actions towards the City of Lac-Mégantic, so that its citizens quickly resume a normal life. The construction of this bridge will also help to unify, symbolically and economically, the founding districts of the City, ”said Minister Gaudreault.
More concretely, this future infrastructure will facilitate travel between the west and the east of the municipal territory by linking the Fatima sector to the city center. This major project stems from the special urban planning program that the municipal council of Lac-Mégantic adopted on September 9 in order to define a vision for the future for its downtown area. The Government of Quebec&#39;s contribution comes from the Quebec-Municipalities Infrastructure Program (PIQM) included in the 2013-2023 Quebec Infrastructure Plan.
In addition, let us recall that the Council of Ministers proceeded, on January 15, to the appointment of Mr. Martin Arsenault as Assistant Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy. Mr. Arsenault is responsible for coordinating government interventions in the reconstruction of downtown and Lac-Mégantic infrastructures.
