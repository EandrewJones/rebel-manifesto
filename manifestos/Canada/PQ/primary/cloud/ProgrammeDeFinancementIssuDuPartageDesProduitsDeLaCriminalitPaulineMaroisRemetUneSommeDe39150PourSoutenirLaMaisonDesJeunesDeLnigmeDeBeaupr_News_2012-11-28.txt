Beaupré– The Premier of Quebec and Member of Parliament for Charlevoix – Côte-de-Beaupré, Pauline Marois, today donated $ 39,150 to the Maison des jeunes l&#39;Énigme de Beaupré. This amount comes from the sale of goods seized by the various police services in Quebec and of goods seized by the courts.
“Crime prevention is a priority for the Government of Quebec, and it is with pride that I donate this amount to the Maison des jeunes l&#39;Énigme. This money will allow stakeholders to pursue their mission, in particular the TAG - Street work project, the aim of which is to listen, inform, educate and support people who are experiencing certain difficulties or who are socially disrupted, in order to to promote their care, ”declared the Member for Charlevoix – Côte-de-Beaupré.
The Maison des jeunes l&#39;Énigme de Beaupré is an organization whose commitment and actions towards the community are recognized today. This financial assistance will be used to provide a lively place for young people aged 11 to 17 to promote their autonomy and provide them with the tools to manage their lives.
Since 1999, a proportion of 25% of the net proceeds from the resale of goods obtained illegally and which have become the property of the State as a result of police operations, has been remitted each year to community organizations in Quebec. This program provides financial assistance to those who work with young people in particular to carry out a crime prevention project.
“I would like to point out that the Government of Quebec was the first, and for a long time the only one, to redistribute a portion of the sums resulting from the resale of property acquired during criminal activities. Thus, organizations working with victims of crime and those dedicated to crime prevention can benefit, ”concluded the Premier.
