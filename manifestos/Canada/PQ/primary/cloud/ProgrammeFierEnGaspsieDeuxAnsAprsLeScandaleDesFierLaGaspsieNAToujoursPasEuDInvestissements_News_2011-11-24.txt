Quebec - The member for Matane, Pascal Bérubé, wonders about the role of FIER Gaspésie, which has still not made any investments in Gaspésie since the outbreak of the FIER scandal by the Parti Québécois in 2009.
“Out of a total envelope of $ 5 million, the largest investment was made in a transportation company in the Outaouais two years ago to the tune of $ 750,000. The other investment was made at Marinard in Rivière-au-Renard for $ 500,000. But for two years, nothing has happened. Why? It is certainly not because the Gaspé is in need of projects and investments, ”said Pascal Bérubé.
Questioned by the member for Matane, Minister Sam Hamad had no structuring answer to deliver to the Gaspésiens. “Three quarters of the overall $ 5 million envelope is still sleeping somewhere in the coffers of FIER Gaspésie, which has no contact with developers in the Gaspé. Announced with great fanfare, the FIERs were to propel the regions with attractive risk capital. It is a failure for the Gaspé ”, continued the member for Matane.
He also points out that the Gaspé, which no longer has a regional minister from the field, a first in 50 years, has suffered a major slap in the face of the Verreault shipyards. “The Liberal government rolled out the red carpet for Davie in Lévis, which we agreed with, but did not lift a finger for Verreault shipyards in Matane. Two weights, two measures. Once again, it is the people of the Gaspé who suffer, with total indifference from the Liberal government, ”concluded Pascal Bérubé.
