Quebec - “We have been calling for a bill to be tabled for almost two years that will increase the role of pharmacists in the health care system. It is time for the Liberal government to finally understand common sense and act. Now, we hope that this bill will be adopted during the current parliamentary session and that it be implemented from 2012 ”.
This is what the member for Taschereau and official opposition spokesperson for health, Agnès Maltais, said after quickly reading Bill 41 tabled today by the Minister of Health and of Social Services, Yves Bolduc.

This Parti Québécois proposal was announced in the spring of 2010 and duly included in the program adopted in April 2011. This proposal would, once implemented, allow pharmacists in Quebec to offer a local service, everywhere on the Internet. the vast territory of Quebec.
The member for Taschereau reminds that pharmacists in Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick and Ontario have this permission to extend, renew and sometimes, under certain conditions, prescribe drugs.
&quot;When we know that one in four Quebecers does not have a family doctor and that the overcrowding in medical clinics and emergencies is often attributable to drug refills, it is the least of things to entrust of this competence to drug specialists, namely pharmacists, ”concluded Agnès Maltais.
