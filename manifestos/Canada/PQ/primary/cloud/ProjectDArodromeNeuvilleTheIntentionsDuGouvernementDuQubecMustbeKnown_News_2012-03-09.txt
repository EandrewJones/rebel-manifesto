Quebec - The Parti Québécois calls on the Liberal government to make public the letter sent to Federal Minister Denis Lebel concerning the aerodrome project in Neuville.
“If four ministers bothered to send a letter to the Government of Canada, there must be some important and significant reasons. We have been calling the government for weeks and the only action has been to send a letter! We want to see her. We need to know the real intentions of the Government of Quebec in such circumstances. If the government wants the support of the official opposition, we still have to know what it is asking for, ”said the member for Taschereau and official opposition spokesperson for the Capitale-Nationale, Agnès Maltais, in recalling in passing that, in the present case, the project does not receive the popular approval of the citizens of Neuville.
The Parti Québécois criticizes the Liberal government for remaining passive. “Correspondence federalism has given no results in recent years. So more must be done. I hope that this letter sets out the actions that the Government of Quebec intends to take to protect the rights of Quebecers, ”continued the member for Marie-Victorin and spokesperson for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Bernard Drainville.
For his part, the member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata and agriculture and food spokesperson André Simard is concerned about the impacts that this aerodrome project could have, particularly on agricultural land, but also on to respect the laws of Quebec.
“The principle is simple: Quebec laws must apply on Quebec territory, particularly those which protect our agricultural territory. Time is running out because the promoters will be able to pave the track in a few weeks and it will be too late. Quebec ministers must act quickly and obtain a response from Denis Lebel, ”added André Simard.
