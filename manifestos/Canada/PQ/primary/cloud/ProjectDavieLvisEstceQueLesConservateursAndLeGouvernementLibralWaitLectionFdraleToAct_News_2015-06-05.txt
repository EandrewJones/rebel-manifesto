Quebec - This morning, at the Salon Bleu, the member for Rousseau and official opposition critic for finance and revenue, Nicolas Marceau, wanted to know if the Liberal government and the Conservatives intended to act to ensure Davie Shipyard receives its fair share of federal marine contracts ahead of the federal election.
&quot; Hurry up. Workers at the Davie shipyard have been living in uncertainty for several months now. The federal government has still not recognized the site so that it can receive contracts, while in Vancouver and Halifax, things are overflowing. The Liberal government and the Minister of the Economy are unable to move the file forward for Quebec, ”said the member for Rousseau.
&quot;Will the Minister of the Economy wait for the federal election campaign to defend the workers at the Davie site who have lost or are at risk of losing their jobs?&quot; Is he resigned to this point? What does he have to say to worried workers and to the mayor of Lévis, who makes it a priority for his city? “, Wanted to know the spokesperson.
Nicolas Marceau recalls that in this context, the shipyard had to lay off 200 of its workers, and that 200 others risk suffering the same fate if the federal government persists in not granting it a contract. “There is no mystery: either the Conservatives are waiting for the election campaign to announce contracts at the Davie shipyard, or they will wait the day after the election to announce that there will not be any. Either way, it&#39;s a filthy political process, ”he continued.
In closing, Nicolas Marceau pointed out that Davie is the largest shipyard in Canada, and that it was named “North American Shipyard of the Year” at the industry&#39;s most prestigious award ceremony. , the Lloyd&#39;s List North American Maritime Awards 2015.
