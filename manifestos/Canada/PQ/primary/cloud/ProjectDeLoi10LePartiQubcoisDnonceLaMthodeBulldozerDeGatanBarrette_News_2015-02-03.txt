Quebec - In reaction to the possibility of a gag order for the adoption of Bill 10, the member for Taillon and official opposition critic for health and access to care, Diane Lamarre, denounces the method of Minister Gaétan Barrette, which consists in &quot;bulldozing&quot; all those who do not share his aims.
“Since day 1, Minister Gaétan Barrette has been talking about the gag order. His technique is to jostle all those who do not think like him. Here, he wants to deviate from the democratic process; It&#39;s not nothing! It is all the more revolting as almost all of the groups heard in parliamentary committee were against his bill. However, to disagree is not to obstruct; the minister seems incapable of understanding this nuance, ”said Diane Lamarre.
The Parti Québécois is trying to improve the bill for the benefit of patients The MP recalls that last week, the minister had to table a series of amendments, proof that his bill requires improvements and that it is not not acceptable in its initial version. The bill aims to correct the current structure of the network, which, let us remember, was set up by Prime Minister Philippe Couillard and adopted under gag order in 2003.
“Bill 10 aims to reorganize the health network according to the wishes of the only person who believes himself to be worthy of judgment in Quebec in matters of health: Minister Gaétan Barrette. He pleads for an application of his law before April 1. For the good of patients, we must take the time to do parliamentary work properly and not give in to pressure from the minister, who wants a quick adoption, but refuses to answer questions. Our work made it possible to make some gains, despite the minister&#39;s closure on the majority of our proposals to improve the bill; we must continue in this direction, ”added the deputy.
Diane Lamarre also recalls that from the start, in this matter, the CAQ shares the aims of liberal austerity and endorses the government&#39;s attacks against the regions.
