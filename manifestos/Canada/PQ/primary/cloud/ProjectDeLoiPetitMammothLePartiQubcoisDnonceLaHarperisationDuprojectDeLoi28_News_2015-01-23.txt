Quebec - The member for Rousseau and official opposition critic for finances and revenue, Nicolas Marceau, once again denounces the method used by the Liberal government to push through its rate increases and its cuts.
“By amalgamating several issues, Bill 28 is in line with the methods of the Harper government. The increases in daycare fees, the abolition of CRÉs and CLDs, the imposition of cuts on pharmacists ... these decisions have in common that they were not taken in the budget, but that they were added to the bill implementing implement this budget, ”declared Nicolas Marceau.
&quot;The government, with its&quot; little mammoth &quot;bill, wants to obscure the debate and bypass the legislative process to pass its cuts and tariff increases as quickly as possible, which is disrespectful for the people directly affected by these measures . Regions, families, pharmacists and many others are getting bad Liberal decisions down their throats. As for us, we refuse to play the government&#39;s game; we will take the time to listen to the speakers in parliamentary committee and to study each aspect of the bill, ”concluded the member for Rousseau.
