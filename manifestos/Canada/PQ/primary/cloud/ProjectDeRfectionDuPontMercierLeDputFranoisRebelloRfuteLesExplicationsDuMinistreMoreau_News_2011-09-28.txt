Quebec - The member for La Prairie, François Rebello, rejects the explanations of the Minister of Transport, Pierre Moreau, concerning the payment of a sum of $ 9 million by the government of Quebec for the repair of the Mercier Bridge. However, after the &quot;extras&quot;, this sum now reaches 20 million dollars.
In 2008, the Société Les Ponts Jacques Cartier et Champlain inc., A company in which the Government of Quebec is a stakeholder and therefore responsible, entered into an agreement with the Mohawk Bridge Consortium. An appendix to this contract stipulates precisely that a single supplier will be selected, namely the company Shockbéton.
It is unprecedented that in the signing of a contract, we specifically name a company. Furthermore, this contract was not subject to a call for tenders. “Minister Moreau maintains that this is common. It&#39;s wrong. This is an extremely rare case. Consequently, the explanations to the effect that the work carried out by Shockbéton would have been carried out in the federal portion of the bridge and its request for an apology are, to say the least, crazy! », Declared François Rebello.
