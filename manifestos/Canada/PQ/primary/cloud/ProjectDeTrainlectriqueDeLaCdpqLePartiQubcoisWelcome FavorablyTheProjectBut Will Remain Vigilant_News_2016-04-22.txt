Quebec - The MP for Vachon and transport spokesperson for the Parti Québécois, Martine Ouellet, and the finance and revenue spokesperson, Nicolas Marceau, ask several questions on behalf of users of the future public transit system announced this morning by the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ).
“Overall, we welcome this electric public transit project in the greater Montreal area, but we will be vigilant on several issues. For example, how does the Caisse plan to meet its performance obligations to retirees while maintaining competitive rates? There is no transportation company in Quebec that is not heavily subsidized by the government and, despite this, many are experiencing financial difficulties. However, all the details of the project seem known, except one: the prices. The Caisse must be transparent with the population of the metropolitan region. If it is able, today, to speak publicly about the hours of service, the travel times and the number of stations, it should be able to advance on the tariffs it intends to impose to achieve profitability and generate profits, as it expects, ”said Martine Ouellet.
Members recall that the Parti Québécois asked the question during the detailed study of the bill establishing the CDPQ-Infra and the answer was clear: the government cannot subsidize the CDPQ-Infra, as it does for others. public transport companies.
“Several other questions arise, therefore. For example, what are the guarantees for retirees that their money is protected when the Caisse starts building and operating public transport services for the first time in Quebec? The Caisse already indicates that part of the profitability of the project will come from its speculation on other real estate projects located along the route. Transparency is essential so that the population knows what to expect, ”added Nicolas Marceau.
