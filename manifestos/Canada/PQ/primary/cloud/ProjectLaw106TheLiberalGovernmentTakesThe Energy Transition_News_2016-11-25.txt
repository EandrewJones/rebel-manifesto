Québec, November 25, 2016 - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Sylvain Rochon, calls on the Liberal government to stop holding the energy transition hostage by forcing the opposition to adopt, within the same bill, the unacceptable chapter on hydrocarbons.
“The Parti Québécois and all the other opposition parties have shown openness, offering Minister Arcand the immediate adoption of the chapters of Bill 106 which concern the energy transition. However, rather than accept this outstretched hand, the minister persists in wanting to associate it with the law on hydrocarbons, which opens the door to a new shale gas crisis in the St.Lawrence lowlands, and pushes the odious until letting the gag hover. Quebec&#39;s transition to renewable energies is a major issue that concerns all Quebecers and which should not be subjected to the questionable political maneuvers of the Liberal Party, ”insisted the spokesperson.
&quot;The government wants to pass a law on hydrocarbons which not only does not prohibit fracking - a risky and controversial technique at the base of the shale gas crisis of a few years ago - but which, in addition , don&#39;t even dare to name it! The Minister tries to reassure us by telling us that fracking will be framed in a possible regulation, but he refuses at the same time to show us this regulation or even to allow the study of it by a parliamentary committee, when it will finally be tabled ” , added the deputy.
“The Liberal government refused our amendments aimed at including, in the basic principles of the law on hydrocarbons, social acceptability, the protection of our agricultural lands and the Gaspé bays, as well as respect for the competences of the municipalities. It is not by closing himself off from the legitimate concerns of scientists, farmers, municipalities and the general public that he will reduce the fears raised by his bill, ”concluded Sylvain Rochon.
