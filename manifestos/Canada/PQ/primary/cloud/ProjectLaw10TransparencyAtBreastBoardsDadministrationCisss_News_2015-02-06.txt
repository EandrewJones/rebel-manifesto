Québec, February 6, 2015 - Diane Lamarre, the member for Taillon and official opposition critic for health and access to care, is delighted with a gain obtained by the Parti Québécois during the study clause of Bill 10.
“The meetings of the boards of directors will be public instead of being in camera, as the minister had initially envisaged in his first set of amendments. This goes in the direction of openness to the population and will undoubtedly have a positive effect on the link between citizens and the decision-making bodies of the CISSS ”, declared Diane Lamarre.
“Despite the adoption under gag order, we are continuing our work in accordance with the priorities we set yesterday; transparency of boards of directors was one of them, ”she added.
