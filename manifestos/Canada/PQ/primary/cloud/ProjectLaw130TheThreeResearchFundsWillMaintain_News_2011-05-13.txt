Quebec - Sylvain Simard, the member for Richelieu and official opposition spokesperson for the Conseil du trésor, the public service and government services, and the member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata and official opposition spokesperson for of research, technology and innovation, André Simard, are very happy to have convinced the Liberal government to maintain the three research funds of Quebec.
The merger of the three research funds provided for in Bill 130 was criticized by the near unanimity of partners in the research community. “The initial intention to merge the three funds surprised everyone, especially since no one had ever questioned the structure. Rather, this model was touted as efficient and effective. The government has never been able to convince us of the value of throwing out a model that works well. Our efforts, combined with those in the community, made it possible to make the government listen to reason. We are happy about it, ”said Sylvain Simard.
The member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata, André Simard, agrees. “We were convinced that the targeted objectives of savings, intersectorality and better performance could be achieved without the merger of the three funds. Today, the government&#39;s retreat proves it. For a year, the research community was mobilized against this merger. Research is the pillar of our economic and social development; we cannot afford to waste so much time in structural debate. Now we have to move forward without wasting time, ”added André Simard.
For her part, the MP for Taillon and official opposition spokesperson for higher education, Marie Malavoy, believes that “the pressure from researchers and faculty will have helped to make the government listen to reason. We have therefore worked in the same direction, all together, for the benefit of research in Quebec ”.
