Quebec - The Minister of Immigration and Cultural Communities and Minister responsible for the Charter of the French Language, Ms. Diane De Courcy, announces that following the vote in principle adopted by the National Assembly, Bill 14 will be studied article by article next fall. The bill seeks to amend the Charter of the French language, the Charter of human rights and freedoms and other legislative provisions in order to strengthen the use of French in various spheres of activity in Quebec society.
“Parliamentarians from three of the four parties represented in the National Assembly supported the principle of strengthening the Charter of the French language. The Liberals chose to do as they did in 1977, that is, to reject everything and to filibuster. Despite the renewal announced by Mr. Couillard, the Liberals still resort to the same old methods. For my part, I believe in the importance of ensuring respect for the right of Quebeckers, by birth or adoption, to live and work in French in Quebec. This is the primary objective of Bill 14, a bill resulting from findings on the notable setbacks in the use of French, in particular in the workplace, ”declared the Minister.
In its last opinion, the Conseil supérieur de la langue française pointed out that in Quebec as a whole, the share of employees of private companies who generally work in French reached 70.8% in 1989. It fell to 59.7% in 1989. 2010.
Ms. De Courcy recalled that the concerns raised by the Coalition Avenir Québec et Québec solidaire as well as the suggestions proposed by speakers in parliamentary committees will be the subject of discussions during the study of each of the articles of the bill. &quot;The real work begins,&quot; said the minister. “I will work with rigor and attention to improve the bill with the elected officials who have indicated their interest. By all working together, we will be able to find solutions so that all Quebecers can live, succeed and work in French in Quebec. &quot;
