Quebec - The Parti Québécois does not understand why the Liberal government of Jean Charest refuses to enrich Quebecers.
“By refusing to include the issues of transformation and royalties in Bill 14, the Charest government is making the deliberate choice to enrich the large foreign multinationals to the detriment of the Quebec population. Why? Asks the member for Vachon and official opposition critic for mines and shale gas, Martine Ouellet.
The member is however delighted to learn that some Liberal MPs now share her point of view. “The news this morning that Liberal MP Daniel Bernard is looking for an alternative to the bad Bill 14 is a good sign; it was time for a Liberal member to stand up and make his government understand that Bill 14 does not enrich Quebeckers, ”she added.
For the Parti Québécois, the Liberal tricks to avoid addressing these issues in the debate on Bill 14 are a hoax. “The natural resources present on Quebec territory belong to us. It&#39;s up to us to make sure that we get the maximum benefit from it. This is our role as elected to the National Assembly and I intend to assume it to the end, ”continued Martine Ouellet.
She pointed out that the study of Bill 14 is progressing well and that in this regard, 90% of the work has been completed. “Next Monday, we will continue studying the bill. There are only 12 articles left to study. We must hope that the government hears the message of the people that we need, with our resources, more royalties to Quebecers and processing in Quebec. We are currently missing out on a potential that can be calculated in billions of dollars, with thousands of jobs in secondary and tertiary processing. Quebec is experiencing a mining boom, but the Charest government prefers to enrich multinationals before the population. We must improve this bill so that it enriches Quebeckers first, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
