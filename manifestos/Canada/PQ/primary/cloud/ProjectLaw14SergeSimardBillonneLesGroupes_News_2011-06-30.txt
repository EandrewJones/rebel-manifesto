Quebec - Following the refusal of the Minister for Natural Resources and Wildlife, Serge Simard, to hear the groups that want to testify in a parliamentary committee on Bill 14, An Act to amend the Mining Act, the Parti Québécois questions the minister&#39;s real desire to reach a consensus on exploration and mining in Quebec.
“As legislators, we need to make sure we have the best bill possible. In that sense, the refusal to hear from groups that have expressed an interest is distressing, said official opposition mining critic Scott McKay. The Liberal government and Minister Simard must stop gagging members of civil society who want to participate in debates. The Union des producteurs agricoles, Manufacturiers et Exportateurs du Québec, the Regional Conference of Elected Officials of Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Sept-Îles sans Uranium, the Confederation of National Trade Unions and Mines Agnico-Eagle Ltée have all submitted a request to be heard and the minister ignored them all. The groups always have relevant additions and comments to make to bills, it is the people on the ground and it is imperative that we hear them, ”added the Member for L&#39;Assomption.
“In Bill 14, the Minister added articles from amendments tabled by the Parti Québécois to the late Bill 79 when, at the time of the detailed study of the latter, the government had voted against these amendments. ! The minister should avoid repeating these mistakes and hear what groups have to say about Bill 14, which is far from being unanimous, ”concluded Scott McKay.
