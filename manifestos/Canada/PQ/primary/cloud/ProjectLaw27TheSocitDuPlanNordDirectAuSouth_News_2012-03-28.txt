Quebec - &quot;The Société du Plan Nord seems on the verge of being set up with the aim of first accommodating the people of the South&quot;, declared the deputy for Ungava and official opposition spokesperson for northern development , Luc Ferland, following the government&#39;s refusal to adopt an amendment proposed by the Parti Québécois.
In fact, the opposition proposed that the president and CEO of the Société du Plan Nord be required to live in the territory covered by the Plan Nord. “It seems to me that it goes without saying that the CEO remains in the territory. Why the Liberals&#39; refusal to include it in the bill? What is the message behind this refusal? », Asked the deputy of Ungava.
“From the start, we have insisted that the Liberal government&#39;s northern marketing plan truly benefits the people who inhabit the territory. Here is another demonstration of the lack of will of the government of Jean Charest. If the main leader of the Société du Plan Nord does not live in the territory, how will he be able to immerse himself in the North and act for the people of the North? “Asked Luc Ferland.
“Unless the Liberal government has already made its choice of CEO and the latter refuses to move north, I do not understand this refusal of an amendment that goes without saying. Once again, this gesture shows that the liberal marketing plan is not a real development plan for the North and its communities, ”concluded Luc Ferland.
