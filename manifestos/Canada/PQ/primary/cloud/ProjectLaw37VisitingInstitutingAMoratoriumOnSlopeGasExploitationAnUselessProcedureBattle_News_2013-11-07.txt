Quebec - The Quebec government denounces the attitude of the opposition parties who insist on delaying the adoption in principle of Bill 37 aimed at establishing a moratorium on certain activities related to the exploration for or the exploitation of natural gas in the shale of the St. Lawrence Lowlands. Through purely procedural maneuvers, the members of the Liberal Party (PLQ) and the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) unduly delay the holding of consultations, the detailed study of the bill and, possibly, the adoption of a requested moratorium. by the citizens of Beauce, Center-du-Québec, Montérégie and Mauricie.
“The question is simple: are we for or against the principle of a moratorium on shale gas, yes or no? We do not want to relive the impact of Bill 43 and waste precious time for citizens, municipalities and experts. If the opposition members are serious about their request for consultations, they need only stop their stubbornness. After adoption in principle, we undertake to hold consultations before the detailed study of the bill, ”declared MP Scott McKay, MP for Repentigny and Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Sustainable Development, the Environment, Wildlife and Parks (National Water Policy section).
It is not unusual to hold special consultations after the adoption of a bill in principle. In the past year, six bills have followed this procedure, which is completely legitimate from a minority government which faces opposition which seems determined to block consideration of the bill. It is therefore out of a concern not to conduct unnecessary consultations involving the expenditure of time and money on the part of several persons or groups that the government proposes to conduct these special consultations after the adoption of the principle.
This procedural battle, however, seems to hide an obvious unease among the members of the CAQ and the PLQ who do not dare to publicly display their opinion on the moratorium project. “So what is the position of the opposition MPs ?, asks the MP for Sainte-Marie-Saint-Jacques and parliamentary assistant to the Prime Minister (electrification of transport), Daniel Breton. We know that the Liberals are behind the financial interests of gas companies. The position of CAQ deputies is more astonishing, when the adoption of a moratorium on shale gas was part of one of their electoral promises. Are they for or against today? I put the question in particular to François Legault (L&#39;Assomption), Donald Martel (Nicolet-Bécancour), Sylvie Roy (Arthabaska) and Sébastien Schneeberger (Drummond-Bois-Franc). Their constituents are waiting for an answer. &quot;
Tabled in the National Assembly on May 15, Bill 37 must pass an additional stage with a view to its official adoption, i.e. a detailed study in a parliamentary committee, before coming back to all the partners for its final adoption.
It should be remembered that the purpose of this bill is to suspend the issuance of certificates of authorization for shale gas exploration or exploitation projects in the Basses-terre-du-Saint-Laurent until &#39;&#39; that the National Assembly has adopted a comprehensive legislative framework. The maximum duration of the moratorium established by the bill is five years.
