Quebec - The member for Sanguinet and official opposition spokesperson for pension plans, Alain Therrien, recalled that thanks to the Parti Québécois amendments to Bill 3, more than 35,000 retirees, who are saw deprived of the indexation of their pension by the Liberal bill, will receive compensation and thus regain their purchasing power.
“Despite our opposition and since the government has a majority, we had two options: let the project be adopted as is, under gag order, or work to obtain the maximum gains for workers and retirees in the municipal sector. We have therefore acted responsibly to reduce the devastating effects of the bill, ”said Alain Therrien.
Indeed, the liberal measures, including the suspension of the indexation of the pension of the retirees, impoverished already vulnerable people. “After 77 hours of work in parliamentary committee, thanks to us, the impact on workers and retirees will be much less. Despite everything, we are going to vote against the bill, among other things because it is a breach of contract, ”said the spokesperson.
“In the coming months, Bill 3 could serve as the basis for further legislative changes affecting defined benefit pension plans in the university and private sectors. Consequently, the gain achieved today will benefit the tens of thousands of retirees who will be affected, ”concluded Alain Therrien.
