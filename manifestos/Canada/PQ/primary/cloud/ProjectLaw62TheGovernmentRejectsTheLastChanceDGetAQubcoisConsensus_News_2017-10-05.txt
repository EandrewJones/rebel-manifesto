Quebec, October 5, 2017 - The official opposition spokesperson for secularism, Agnès Maltais, deplores the fact that the Couillard government has once again refused to adhere to the Quebec consensus on the secularism of the state.
IN SHORT
“Today, our parliamentary rules offered the Couillard government a final opportunity to adhere to the Quebec consensus on secularism. Even though they aimed to translate this consensus into the bill, our latest amendments were all rejected by all the Liberal members; this definitively rules out any possibility of unity on the issue, ”deplores Agnès Maltais.
Here are the amendments proposed by the Parti Québécois:
“The government will therefore impose its solution on Quebecers, instead of hearing their concerns. Let us add that its refusal to clearly include the principle of the secularism of the State in our laws sends the signal that the State must submit to all religious precepts. In other words, the bill in no way protects the state from the influence of religions, a principle dear to Quebeckers, ”concluded Agnès Maltais.
