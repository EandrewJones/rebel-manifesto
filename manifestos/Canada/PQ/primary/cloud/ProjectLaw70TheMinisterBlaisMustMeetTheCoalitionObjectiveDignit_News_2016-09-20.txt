Quebec - The deputy for Saint-Jean and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of employment, social solidarity and the fight against poverty, Dave Turcotte, and the deputy for Gouin and spokesperson for Québec solidaire, Françoise David, ask the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, François Blais, to meet with representatives of the Objectif Dignité Coalition in order to discuss the proposal it put forward yesterday.
“The Coalition made a constructive proposal and I think the minister should listen to it, that&#39;s the least of it. If François Blais refuses to discuss with the Coalition, we will have to conclude that the dice are loaded and that he had received an order from his leader, Philippe Couillard, to pass Bill 70 under the gag order. On the other hand, if he is in good faith, the minister will agree to sit down with the groups to find a solution. The Coalition rejects the status quo, it proposes changes. Why would the minister close the door? Asked Dave Turcotte.
“The time is not for a gag order, but for negotiation. The Coalition represents frontline workers with social assistance recipients. His proposal must be taken seriously. I sincerely hope that Minister Blais will agree to sit down quickly with his members to find a solution that will achieve consensus among parliamentarians and in civil society. Imposing penalties could lead providers to the streets or to petty crime. Quebec must move forward towards the creation of an effective program that can help new recipients of social assistance to voluntarily embark on a path that will definitely lift them out of poverty, ”considers Françoise David for her part.
The Objectif Dignité Coalition proposes two things in particular:
“Our goal is above all to encourage people to participate in return-to-work programs, while avoiding putting them in a perilous situation. However, in its current form, Bill 70 does quite the opposite, ”concluded the two spokespersons.
