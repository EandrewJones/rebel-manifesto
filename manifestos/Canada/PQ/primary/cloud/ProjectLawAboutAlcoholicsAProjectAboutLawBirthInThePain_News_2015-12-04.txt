Quebec - The Parti Québécois welcomes the tabling of Bill 88 on the development of the artisanal alcoholic beverage industry, tabled today in the National Assembly by the Minister of Finance. “However, it must be noted that the bill falls far short of fulfilling the promises the Liberal Party made to Quebec wine and alcohol producers. The Liberal government is once again disappointing. This is what the member for Rousseau and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of finance and revenue, Nicolas Marceau, declared.
“The quarrels between the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Agriculture got the better of Bill 395 tabled by the member for Huntingdon. Today, the latter should not be very proud of his government, ”continued the member for Rousseau.
Berthier&#39;s deputy and spokesman for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, noted the lack of ambition of the Minister of Agriculture to develop the craft alcoholic beverage sector. &quot;For the second year in a row, it took the intervention of the Parti Québécois for the government to commit to fulfilling its financial obligations to winegrowers.&quot; Minister Paradis has no vision or ambition for the Quebec agri-food sector and for the alcoholic beverage sector in particular. Bill 88 demonstrates this reality once again. It is not with this bill that the booming Quebec alcoholic beverage sector will see its ambitions supported by the government, ”he concluded.
