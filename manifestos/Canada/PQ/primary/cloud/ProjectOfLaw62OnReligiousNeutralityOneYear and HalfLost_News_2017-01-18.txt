Quebec, January 18, 2017 - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on secularism, Agnès Maltais, welcomes the decision of the Minister of Justice to amend Bill 62 on the religious neutrality of the State, which, in its current form, has a large number of shortcomings. Let us recall that the Parti Québécois has made numerous amendment proposals to it; we expect her to respond positively to them.
“Among the significant amendments proposed in the fall, we must include the principle of the secularism of the State and that of equality between women and men in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. It is also necessary to prohibit the signs of religious conviction for the people in position of authority, and to add the duty of reserve of the civil servants ”, initially insisted Agnès Maltais.
“It is also essential to remove from the bill the exception concerning the prohibition of the covered face in the provision and reception of public services, and to add to it the express prohibition of wearing the chador in the Quebec public service. Finally, we must regain control over requests for religious accommodation and draw up guidelines so that practices in this matter are clear and uniform throughout the two major public service networks, ”she continued.
“While the Parti Québécois has been defending the secularism of the state for years, after two and a half years of Liberal government, nothing has yet been settled. The government, if it had listened to citizens, should have understood as early as 2015 that its bill did not meet the expectations of Quebecers in matters of secularism. But no! For a year and a half, he has persisted in wanting to pass this &quot;liberal&quot; bill, as the Minister of Justice described it, &quot;said Agnès Maltais.
