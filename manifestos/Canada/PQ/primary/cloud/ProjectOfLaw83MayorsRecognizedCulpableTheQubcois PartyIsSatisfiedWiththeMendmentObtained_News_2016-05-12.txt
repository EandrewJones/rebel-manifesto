Quebec - The MNA for René-Lévesque, Martin Ouellet, welcomes the adoption of an amendment concerning mayors convicted of offenses against the Criminal Code in Bill 83, An Act to amend various legislative provisions in municipal matters, in particular concerning funding Politics. &quot;The minister finally agreed with our arguments, and we are very satisfied with it,&quot; he said.
Remember that in April, the Parti Québécois asked the minister to ensure that mayors found guilty of an offense under the Criminal Code can be dismissed, regardless of the sentence. The tabling of an amendment to the bill responded to this legitimate demand.
“This is great news. Some situations had become untenable and we had to find a way to remedy them. The tabling of a petition and the exit of the Parti Québécois will probably have opened the eyes of the Minister, ”explained Martin Ouellet.
Indeed, a week before Minister Coiteux&#39;s announcement, the deputy for René-Lévesque and his colleague Carole Poirier, in the company of members of the CALACS Lumière Boréale of Baie-Comeau, the Regroupement des femmes de la Côte-Nord and the Regroupement women&#39;s groups in the Capitale? Nationale region (Portneuf – Québec – Charlevoix), had drawn media attention to this important issue.
“I hope the law will be applied soon after it comes into force. The victims have waited long enough, and the situation in which they find themselves is unacceptable, ”concluded Martin Ouellet.
