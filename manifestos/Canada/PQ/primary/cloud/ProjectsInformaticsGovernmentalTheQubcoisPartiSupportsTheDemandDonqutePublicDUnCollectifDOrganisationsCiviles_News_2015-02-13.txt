Quebec– The member for Bonaventure and official opposition spokesperson for information resources, Sylvain Roy, welcomes with opening the request for a public inquiry into the awarding of contracts in the field of information technologies and implementation of IT projects in the government of Quebec, formulated by a collective of 16 civil organizations.
“Quebeckers are tired of their money being wasted on computer fiascos. We must act sustainably. We are open to a process of inquiry and to a public debate, as suggested by the collective. It will be necessary to evaluate and adapt the proposed formula in order to obtain the best possible result. However, measures must be put in place immediately by the President of the Treasury Board, Martin Coiteux, ”said Sylvain Roy.
The member also reminds us that we would not be there if ten years of Liberal rule had not considerably reduced professional expertise in the Government of Quebec.
“In 18 months, the Parti Québécois government had acted on three fronts: creation of two centers of expertise in the regions, promotion of the use of free software and reflection on contractual practices and calls for tenders. Martin Coiteux must stop blocking these concrete actions so that the situation can improve now, ”concluded the MP for Bonaventure.
