Quebec– The deputy for Bonaventure, Sylvain Roy, indicates that the Parti Québécois will support Bill 37, which subjects the Port-Daniel – Gascons cement plant and marine terminal project to the only authorization regime provided for in article 22 of the Environment Quality Act.
“We are very proud to see the cement plant project take shape. It was our government which, with the partners and the people of Gaspé, had relaunched it; we believed, with Premier Pauline Marois in mind, in the economic and social development of the Gaspé. The establishment of a cement plant in Port-Daniel – Gascons will create lasting jobs and diversify the region&#39;s economy. In this sense, we will support Bill 37, ”said Sylvain Roy.
In addition, the member for Bonaventure would like the company Ciment McInnis to submit specific commitments regarding the conversion of the cement plant to fuels with lower environmental impact. “We support the environmental monitoring committee and the environmental mediation process set up jointly by the Center québécois du droit de l&#39;environnement and Ciment McInnis; We can thus hope to make the cement plant progress towards reducing its environmental footprint, ”added Sylvain Roy.
