Québec– The Member for Duplessis and official opposition spokesperson for northern development, Lorraine Richard, is delighted that the amendments made by the Parti Québécois to Bill 11 have meant that the Société du Plan Nord will have to be more present north of the 49th parallel, more transparent and more attentive to the populations of the territory.
“The best placed to implement sustainable and responsible development in the North, and thus avoid the mistakes of the past, are the Quebeckers who live there. After several hours of debate in parliamentary committee, we succeeded in convincing the government that it is essential that the Société du Plan Nord be more in harmony with the local populations. The amendments we have made to the bill creating the Company are a reflection of this concern, ”said Lorraine Richard.
These amendments are, in particular:
The MNA for Marie-Victorin and official opposition spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, and the MNA for Bonaventure and spokesperson for forests, Sylvain Roy, also participated in the parliamentary committee. &quot;The exploitation of natural resources in the territory covered by the Plan Nord must be done in a responsible manner and for the benefit of all Quebecers, more particularly the people who live there,&quot; they stressed.
