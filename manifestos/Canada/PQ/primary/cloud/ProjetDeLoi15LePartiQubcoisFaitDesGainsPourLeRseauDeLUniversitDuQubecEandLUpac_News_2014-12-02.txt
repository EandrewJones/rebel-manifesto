Quebec - Following the detailed study of Bill 15, the MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Carole Poirier, announced that thanks to the gains obtained by the Parti Québécois in parliamentary committee, the Université du Québec network will not be subject to a different enrollment control regime from that of chartered universities.
Moreover, thanks, once again, to the work of the deputies of the official opposition, the UPAC will not be subjected to this control of the numbers. “While investigations are targeting the Liberal Party, it would have been inappropriate to let the current government establish the membership level of UPAC. It was simply unacceptable, ”said Carole Poirier.
It should be remembered that the bill, in its original form, would have subjected the Université du Québec network to a staffing control that the chartered universities will not be subjected to. “It was out of the question to allow a situation to be created with two weights and two measures. The Université du Québec network must have the same possibilities for development, performance and influence as other universities, especially since it is a guarantee of accessibility and vitality in the region, ”added Véronique Hivon , who also took part in the work.

Although the CAQ voted for the withdrawal of the University of Quebec network from Bill 15, the parliamentary work was not done by this formation.
“The CAQ has not tabled any amendment. She just acted as an extra throughout the process. His request yesterday to remove the network from the bill was just a maneuver to grab some credit in the eyes of those affected by this change. If the government amended its bill, it is thanks to pressure from the Parti Québécois and the groups concerned. The CAQ watched the parade go by, and QS was absent, ”concluded Carole Poirier.
