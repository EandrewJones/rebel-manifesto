Quebec - MP Martine Ouellet, spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of transport, maritime strategy, transport electrification and digital strategy, this morning tabled Bill 593, An Act to counter illegal taxis, in order to provide the Minister of Transport with additional tools to promote compliance with Quebec laws. Ms. Ouellet was accompanied, for the occasion, by representatives of the Regroupement des ouvriers autonomes Metallos, the Regroupement des intermediaries du taxi de Québec, the provincial committee for concertation and development of the taxi and taxi industry of Lévis and the Chaudière-Appalaches region.
“The Prime Minister and the Minister of Transport claim that they are powerless and that they cannot stop the illegal taxi, although they have several tools to do so. Cities like Calgary, Vancouver and Paris have also succeeded in stopping the phenomenon. Our bill proposes ways to remedy this liberal laxity, in order to ensure that the law is respected, ”said the member for Vachon.
The bill proposes a gradation of measures to encourage drivers to comply with the laws. During a first offense, illegal taxi drivers would see four demerit points entered in their file, and their license would be suspended for 28 days in the event of a repeat offense.
&quot;As requested by most of the actors concerned, including the CMM and the mayor of Montreal, the least thing would be for the Minister of Transport to take the necessary means to ensure compliance with Quebec laws, at least as long as the parliamentary committee will last. . To do so, he must quickly pass the bill we are proposing and use the tools already at his disposal to put an end to illegal taxis. We are of course prepared to work together with him in this regard, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
