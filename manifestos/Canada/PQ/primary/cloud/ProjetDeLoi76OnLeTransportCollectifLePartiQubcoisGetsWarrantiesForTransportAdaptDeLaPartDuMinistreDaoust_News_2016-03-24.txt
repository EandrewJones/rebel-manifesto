Quebec - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of transport, maritime strategy, transport electrification and digital strategy and Member of Parliament for Vachon, Martine Ouellet, as well as André Villeneuve, Member of Parliament for Berthier, obtained guarantees from the Minister Jacques Daoust in the area of paratransit, during the clause-by-clause consideration of Bill 76.
“On the issue of maintaining the paratransit service in the northern and southern crowns of Montreal, Minister Daoust has given us clear guarantees as to the continuity of the contracts currently in force. There will be no reduction in service, ”said Martine Ouellet.
The Minister also affirmed that with the establishment of the Metropolitan Transport Network, inter-territorial travel would be facilitated. In addition, for areas outside the territory, the Regional Metropolitan Transport Authority will have the obligation, depending on an amendment, to provide continuity of services for users of paratransit.
In order to assert the concerns of the population of Lanaudière, André Villeneuve submitted to a parliamentary committee a letter from the Regroupement des users de transport adapté de Lanaudière. The Minister is invited to continue the project which offers people eligible for paratransit a service allowing them to travel throughout the Lanaudière territory, at least one day per week.
“This service is really important to the people in my area. The project makes it possible to break the isolation and make the various transport services accessible to the entire Lanaudière population, ”said André Villeneuve.
The Parti Québécois will continue to do its work in parliamentary committee to clarify and improve Bill 76.
