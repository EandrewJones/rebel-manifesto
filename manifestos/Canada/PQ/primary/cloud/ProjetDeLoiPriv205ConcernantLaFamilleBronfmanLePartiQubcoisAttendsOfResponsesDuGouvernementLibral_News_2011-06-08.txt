Quebec - During a meeting held this morning, the member for La Prairie, François Rebello, submitted five specific questions to the Liberal government in order to know all the impacts of the adoption of private bill 205 concerning certain deeds of donation from Samuel Bronfman and filed by D&#39;Arcy-McGee MP Lawrence Bergman.
“While the government was to proceed to detailed study of the bill today, we asked for clarification before consenting to the passage of the bill. So we are on hold, ”said Mr. Rebello.
He points out that in the past, an advance ruling by the Federal Revenue Department regarding the transfer of an estimated $ 2.2 billion family trust from the Bronfman family to the United States cost the federal government $ 700 million. This situation had also been sharply criticized by the Auditor General of Canada at the time, Denis Desautels.
“Before passing such a bill, it is entirely legitimate to question the Bronfman family, the bill&#39;s sponsor MP and former family lawyer Lawrence Bergman, and the government on the impact of the adoption of this bill. We want to act rigorously and with fairness for taxpayers, ”concluded François Rebello.
The five questions submitted by François Rebello to the Liberal government are as follows:
