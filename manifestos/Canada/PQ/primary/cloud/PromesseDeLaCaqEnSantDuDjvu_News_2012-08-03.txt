Montreal - “Listening to François Legault and Gaétan Barrette today, you would have thought you heard Jean Charest in 2003 who also promised to magically end the wait in health. The lure did not last very long, however. The reality is that Quebecers are now waiting an hour longer in the emergency room than in 2003. The promise of the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) is as unrealistic as that of the Liberals, ”declared the candidate of the Parti Québécois in the riding of Saint-François, Réjean Hébert.
The Parti Québécois candidate also wonders about the costs of the promise. After announcing that the problems of the health network would be resolved in 30 months at zero cost, this morning, the CAQ announces that the zero cost actually represents a sum of $ 600 million.
“Gaétan Barrette and François Legault must explain themselves. Yesterday there must have been enough money in the system to fix all the waiting problems, today it will cost over half a billion dollars. Who are we to believe? Gaétan Barrette who says that everything can be done at zero cost or François Legault who says that 600 million are needed to get there? Obviously, there is a lot of improvisation at the CAQ, ”added Réjean Hébert, recalling that the Coalition&#39;s program also plans to increase the remuneration of physicians by $ 500 million.
“For the Parti Québécois, the real solutions to unclog the health system can be found upstream and downstream from the hospital. By stepping up health promotion and developing an effective home care network so that our seniors can stay at home as long as possible, we will be able to better distribute resources and offer better services, ”concluded Réjean Hébert.
