Quebec - The Minister responsible for Democratic Institutions and Citizen Participation, Bernard Drainville, today released the results of an opinion survey by the firm Léger Recherche Stratégie Conseil carried out this spring, to find out where the population is located from Quebec on the issue of religious accommodation.
In particular, it emerges that five years after the Bouchard-Taylor Commission:
“The Premier asked me to offer Quebeckers a charter of Quebec values, and that is what my team and I have been working on over the past few months. Quebeckers want the government more than ever to protect and strengthen Quebec values, and in particular, equality between women and men and the religious neutrality of our institutions. This is why we will soon be making known the government&#39;s proposals in terms of the framework for religious accommodation and the affirmation of Quebec values, ”explained Bernard Drainville.
“The reasonable accommodation crisis of 2007 remained unanswered. Nothing has been settled. Today, Quebecers are asking for clear rules to regulate requests for religious accommodation. Quebec society is increasingly multiethnic. We are a welcoming people, open to the world, but the social contract must be clarified in order to facilitate the integration of all Quebecers, regardless of their origin or their creed. The time has come to unite around our common values, ”added Bernard Drainville.
“Since the start of our mandate, we have affirmed that the Quebec identity is a priority for our government. The project that we will table in the fall will offer a balanced and unifying vision. Quebeckers want us to affirm Quebec&#39;s values loud and clear, and that is what we are going to do, ”the Minister concluded.
