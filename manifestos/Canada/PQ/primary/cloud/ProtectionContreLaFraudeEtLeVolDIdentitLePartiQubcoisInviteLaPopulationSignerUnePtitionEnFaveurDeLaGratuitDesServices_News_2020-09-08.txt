Québec, September 8, 2020 - The deputy for René-Lévesque and the Parti Québécois spokesperson for the economy and finances, Martin Ouellet, calls on Quebeckers to be heard and to demand free access to protective measures of their credit report provided for in Bill 53, Credit Assessment Officers Act. To this end and on their behalf, he will soon submit to the National Assembly a petition that he is sponsoring, initiated by the Union des consommateurs.
IN SHORT
The member for René-Lévesque believes that all Quebecers should be able to benefit - as quickly as possible and free of charge - from the measures to protect their credit files contained in Bill 53. “I cannot accept that Quebecers are putting themselves at risk because they cannot afford to pay to put a credit lock on their file. Currently, the credit agencies charge exaggerated fees simply to inform you that your file is the object of suspicious activity ”, illustrated Martin Ouellet.
During the specific consultations on the bill, moreover, most of the stakeholders agreed to demand that the protective measures provided for therein be free. Even the credit bureaus were prepared to move forward, when they will likely have to fund these measures for the sake of consumers. Desjardins - the only financial institution that saw fit to come to the consultations, by the way - also supported this position, put forward last December by the Parti Québécois.
“No one is immune to data theft, and all Quebecers should benefit from the same protection against this scourge. I therefore invite them to apply this solidarity which characterizes us by signing the petition, ”concluded the deputy.
