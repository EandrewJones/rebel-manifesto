Québec, December 15, 2016 - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Sylvain Rochon, calls on the Liberal government to stop hiding behind administrative processes and to finally take a clear political decision as for the oil exploration project on Anticosti Island.
Recall that earlier this week, the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and the Fight against Climate Change confirmed that from an administrative point of view, its regulations were respected and that it authorized, therefore, the change site of a drilling site where the first hydraulic fracturing operations are to be carried out on Anticosti Island.
“Despite Philippe Couillard&#39;s discourse with an environmental flavor, the oil and gas exploration project continues to progress in Anticosti, in particular because of this decision and Bill 106, which was forcibly adopted, under gag order. Only a clear political decision would clear up the confusion that reigns over the Liberal government&#39;s intentions on this issue. Its current attitude, which consists in criticizing the contract without doing anything to end it, is indecent, ”declared Sylvain Rochon.
“The government must, without further delay, begin negotiations to end the contract between it and its private sector partners in the Hydrocarbons Anticosti joint venture. If financial compensation must be offered, let a competent and neutral body be given the mandate to assess the amount, and put an end to this project with all due respect for the partners involved in it, ”concluded the deputy.
