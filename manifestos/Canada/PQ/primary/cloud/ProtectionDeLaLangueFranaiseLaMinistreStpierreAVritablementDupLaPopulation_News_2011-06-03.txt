Quebec - “Bill 103, which partially became law gag order 115 on bridging schools, included other articles than those relating to these schools. These articles were intended to strengthen certain provisions of the Charter of the French language concerning, in particular, the language policies of universities and municipalities. This bill also included a major amendment to the Charter of human rights and freedoms to affirm French as the official language of Quebec and a fundamental element of its cultural heritage and social cohesion. However, Minister Christine St-Pierre&#39;s response this morning is unequivocal: she never really intended to make these changes. It&#39;s a shame &quot;.
This was stated by the member for Borduas and official opposition spokesperson for language, Pierre Curzi, who described these measures as &quot;candy measures in order to swallow the bridging school snake&quot;.
Mr. Curzi wondered about the absence of a new bill incorporating these measures, an intention expressed by Minister St-Pierre during the study of the appropriations a few weeks ago. “This morning, everyone will have understood from the minister&#39;s answers that she has no intention of proposing these measures again in another bill,” added the member for Borduas. Rather than protecting the French language, the minister is doing exactly the opposite, ”added the member for Borduas.
“While all the figures and linguistic indicators raise fears of an anglicization of Greater Montreal, Minister St-Pierre prefers to forfeit her passive and ineffective attitude rather than attempting to remedy the situation by strengthening the application of the charter. It is appalling. If she has no interest in this crucial issue, let her tell the Prime Minister, ”concluded Pierre Curzi.
