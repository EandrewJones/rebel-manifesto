Quebec - Following the seizure of more than 500 dogs in the Outaouais in what appears to be a puppy mill, the member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata and official opposition critic for agriculture and food, André Simard, calls on Minister Pierre Corbeil to respect his government&#39;s commitment to protect pets in Quebec. “In October 2009, after the meticulous work of a working group, a report was tabled with the Minister of Agriculture and the latter undertook to modify the Animal Health Protection Act in order to revise upwards fines and penalties for ill-treatment of animals. Two years later, the government has still not acted in this direction. It is pure negligence, ”said MP André Simard. The member wonders why the recent seizure in Outaouais did not take place before, since the local SPCA says that this place has been in its sights for a long time. “Why has the government waited so long and is now putting itself into reaction mode? Why didn&#39;t he take action if he had known that something had been wrong there for several years? Asks Mr. Simard. He doubts that the draft regulations on the protection of companion animals will really solve the problems. “The government has no portrait of the pet industry in Quebec. He does things backwards, ”concluded André Simard.
