Quebec - The leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, today denounced the Liberal retreat in protecting head offices, while the government abandons its promise.
“In a few months, Quebec lost ownership of Cirque du Soleil, Rona, St-Hubert, and this, to the total indifference of the Prime Minister. However, this is a political issue. During the last election campaign, the Prime Minister and his economic trio promised just the opposite. They made a commitment to draw on the Generations Fund to protect our head offices. It was March 13, 2014, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
The Minister of Transport, then a member of the economic trio, indeed declared: “[our] proposal would have enabled us to intervene quickly in the case of the hostile [takeover bids] on Rona and Osisko, and to work in collaboration with the management of these companies to ensure the maintenance of their respective head offices in Quebec ”.
“The Prime Minister must explain to us why today he is saying exactly the opposite of what he said during the election campaign. Will he, yes or no, keep his promise to create a head office protection fund at the Caisse de dépôt? While he is unable to say why he is reneging on the commitments he himself made in March 2014, the question that arises is: what will be the next company to leave Quebec while the government does nothing? », Concluded the leader of the Parti Québécois.
