Quebec– The member for Terrebonne and official opposition spokesperson for family matters, Mathieu Traversy, today tabled in the National Assembly a petition signed by 86,172 people calling for the safeguard of Quebec&#39;s family policy. This petition was initiated by the Association québécoise des CPE and supported by the campaign Always crazy about our children?
“All the signatories come to tell the Prime Minister and the Minister of Families, Francine Charbonneau, that we are committed to family policy measures. In eight months, the minister has managed to alienate almost the entire network of childcare services. His ideological decisions worry Quebec families. More than 50,000 parents demonstrated in the streets, and nearly 90,000 signed the petition; when will the minister listen to them? “Asked Mathieu Traversy.
Remember that Prime Minister Philippe Couillard lied to Quebec families during the election campaign, when he promised not to increase the prices of childcare services and to continue to develop the network. “Not only has the government slowed down the creation of places, but it has also imposed a price shock on families, a real family tax that hits those of the middle class. The betrayal of the Liberal government is obvious; he must back down on his decisions, which go against the very spirit of Quebec&#39;s family policy, ”added the member for Terrebonne.
