Quebec, April 7, 2020 - Due to the rampant COVID-19 pandemic, citizens&#39; level of anxiety may increase to such an extent that some are tempted to consider a solution that is not one: the suicide. “It is essential to provide all the necessary support to the resources in place; We have to help those who help, ”insists the member for Rimouski and Parti Québécois spokesperson for social solidarity and social services, Harold LeBel.
IN SHORT
We are already seeing a significant increase in the volume of calls to suicide prevention centers across Quebec. “The situation is likely to worsen further, while the government of François Legault is preparing to unveil its figures. Transparency is important, but we cannot deny that it risks having an impact on the morale of citizens, as we have seen in Ontario and British Columbia, for example. Our aid resources are already overwhelmed, ”said the MP.
What is more, stakeholders are concerned. “What if ever we identified one or more cases in a call center, if some had to cease operations? The government has asked them to find alternative solutions, possibly by redirecting calls to a center in another region, but the fact remains that additional staff will be needed. We therefore hope that the government will appeal to retirees or volunteers trained to intervene with people in distress, ”added Harold LeBel.
Of course, this will not be done at zero cost. “Quebec will have to inject the necessary sums to allow the centers and help lines to pursue their mission. Listening and support services must continue to be available at all times. We do not have the right to leave anyone behind, and more particularly during this period, ”concluded the member for Rimouski.
