Quebec - On the occasion of the 26th National Suicide Prevention Week, the Parti Québécois spokesperson for social services, youth protection, home care and prevention, Jean-François Lisée, expresses his concern about the consequences of liberal austerity on the support offered to suicidal people.
“The effects of liberal austerity are worrying. Suicide prevention workers are sounding the alarm: 15% of calls received to the 1 866 APPELLE help number are unanswered, ”said Jean-François Lisée.
“Since coming to power, the Liberals have cut $ 23.7 million in prevention and public health. In addition, there are many austerity measures directly affecting the most vulnerable people in our society. The needs are increasing, and organizations are struggling to meet the task. They need government support more than ever. And, when it comes to keeping someone alive, we will all agree that these services should not be frivolous, ”continued the spokesperson.
“In Quebec, suicide causes the loss of three people a day, three people too many. Thanks to the mobilization of society, we have managed to make significant gains. However, the rates remain very high, particularly among those aged 35 to 49. It is imperative to continue prevention efforts. All means must be put in place so that every Quebecer knows where to find help, and that he is assured of receiving it when he needs it, ”concluded Jean-François Lisée.
