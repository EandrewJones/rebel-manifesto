Quebec - The MP for Marie-Victorin and official opposition critic for energy, Bernard Drainville, finds it irresponsible that the Minister of Natural Resources, Clément Gignac, did not call for an economic evaluation of the oil field discovered on Anticosti Island.
Questioned in the National Assembly today, Minister Gignac seemed unaware that article 176 of the Mining Act allows the minister to obtain an economic evaluation of an oil field.
“It is absolutely astounding that the Liberal government refuses to know the extent of the oil field on Anticosti Island. The independent estimates unveiled by the Pétrolia company speak of 30 billion barrels of oil. This deposit has the potential to become a veritable “Klondike” for Quebec and the Charest government let it slip away for nothing ”, denounced the deputy.
The Parti Québécois believes that this oil belongs to Quebecers and that it is imperative that the secret agreement concluded in 2007, by which Hydro-Quebec ceded to Pétrolia its rights to Anticosti oil, be known to the population.
“For months, the government has refused to disclose any information on this agreement. It is not normal that we cannot know the royalty that Quebeckers will receive from Pétrolia. It is not normal that we do not know the value of oil on Anticosti Island. This resource is ours and Quebecers have a right to know, ”concluded Bernard Drainville.
