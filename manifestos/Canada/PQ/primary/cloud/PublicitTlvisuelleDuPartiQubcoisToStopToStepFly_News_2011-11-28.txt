Montreal - The Parti Québécois yesterday launched its television advertising, the second phase of the 5 ideas advertising campaign for Quebec. It will be on the air for the next two weeks on the following channels: Canal Vie, Séries +, Historia and Canal D. It can also be viewed by following this link: http: //go.pq.org/54p. The listeners of the program Occupation double could see it last night.
With this advertising message, which recalls the main scandals associated with the Liberal Party and Jean Charest, the Parti Québécois now wants to establish the stakes for the next election campaign. “The Liberal Party has allowed the political climate to rot and is at the origin of the public&#39;s cynicism towards its political class. François Legault&#39;s CAQ is not proposing anything to curb corruption and renovate our democracy. The only party proposing real change to regain the confidence of Quebeckers is the Parti Québécois. The stake of the next electoral campaign is clear. The Liberals will have to be judged for having allowed villainous groups to have robbed Quebeckers, ”declared the president of the national executive council of the Parti Québécois, Raymond Archambault.
The president of the Parti Québécois also invites Quebeckers to consult the party&#39;s program by following this link: pq.org/programme and to see the advertising campaign launched last week by following this link: pq.org/5idees. &quot;Seeing what we are proposing in terms of ideas and seeing the team for change represented by the deputies and the leader of the Parti Québécois, I am sure that it is in us that Quebeckers will trust in the next election&quot; , concluded Raymond Archambault.
