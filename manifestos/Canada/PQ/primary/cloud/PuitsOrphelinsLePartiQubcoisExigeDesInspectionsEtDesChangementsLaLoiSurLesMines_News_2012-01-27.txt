“The BAPE was very clear in its report on the exploration and exploitation of shale gas. It is necessary to set up at the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks (MDDEP) a tight environmental monitoring program for orphan wells. This plan, as in the case of landfills, should be linked to obtaining a certificate of authorization under article 22 of the Environment Quality Act ”, continued, for for his part, the member for L&#39;Assomption and spokesperson for sustainable development, the environment and parks, Scott McKay.
“During the detailed study of Bill 14, we tabled an amendment requiring gas companies to submit a well redevelopment and restoration plan and to deposit financial guarantees for the closure of the wells. The government refused our requests. With the information unveiled today, the government has an obligation to act and provide for a comprehensive plan including amendments to the Mining Act and an MDDEP monitoring plan for orphan wells in Quebec, ”concluded Martine Ouellet. .
