Quebec - The Minister of Labor, Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Ms. Agnès Maltais, encourages employer and union stakeholders to get back to work now in order to negotiate the renewal of agreements collective of 77,000 construction workers in the institutional-commercial and industrial sectors.
The Minister has already assured the parties that she is making available to them the expertise of the mediation-conciliation team of the Ministry of Labor as well as that of Mr. Normand Gauthier. They will therefore be able to count on these specialists to assist them in seeking a settlement.
“The time has come to resume negotiations. I urge employer and union representatives to put aside their differences and make every effort to reach a negotiated settlement. They need to find a passage allowing the renewal of collective agreements in the institutional-commercial and industrial sectors ”, declared Minister Maltais.
On July 1, the National Assembly adopted Bill 54 on the resumption of work in the construction industry. In addition to putting an end to the strike in these sectors, the Act renewed the collective agreements of the 77,000 union members until June 30 and increased wages by 2% for the period from July 2, 2013 to June 30, 2014.
“The exercise that is beginning is important. Tools are offered to the parties, including a resource person such as Mr. Normand Gauthier. However, it is their responsibility to reach an agreement, ”concluded the Minister of Labor.
Remember that the last round of negotiations in the construction industry led to the renewal of collective agreements in the other sectors of the industry, namely civil engineering and roads as well as residential.
