Quebec - The member for Vachon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in the areas of transport, maritime strategy and transport electrification, Martine Ouellet, is very surprised to hear the Prime Minister, at the Paris Conference, ask the government federal government to do more with public transit.
“It&#39;s good that Mr. Couillard is urging the federal government to do its part in the area of public transit, but what is the government of Quebec doing? Currently, nearly $ 500 million from the Green Fund and dedicated to public transit is sleeping in the coffers of the Government of Quebec. During this time and since the arrival in power of the Liberal Party of Quebec, all major public transport projects have been frozen; think of the extension of the blue line of the Montreal metro, the rapid service by Quebec-Lévis bus and the one on Pie-IX, the light rail system on the new Champlain Bridge, the electrification of the Saint-Michel axis , and many more. The Couillard government has one of the worst public transit records; I don&#39;t see who he can teach lessons to, ”said Martine Ouellet.
In addition, yesterday, we learned that real estate projects were being planned around the stations of the possible light rail system that would be built on the new Champlain Bridge, while the decision of the Government of Quebec and the Caisse de deposit and placement on the completion of the project will not be taken for more than a year yet.
“The Marois government had decided by choosing the light rail system as the mode of public transport on the new Champlain Bridge. He even started the project office. Another issue that has been blighted since the Liberal Party of Quebec came to power. The citizens of the South Shore can only dream of the project now. We have been studying it for more than a decade and the government continues to extend the deadlines by ordering other studies, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
