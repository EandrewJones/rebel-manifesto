Quebec, August 19, 2016 - We learn that the management of the CHSLD Chanoine-Audet in Saint Romuald, in which several sexual assaults were committed, was not only aware, but also waited more than a year before alerting the police. Harold LeBel, Member of Parliament for Rimouski and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois pour les Seniors, and Diane Lamarre, Member of Parliament for Taillon and spokesperson for health and access to care, ask the Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette, to investigation of the events which occurred there and to take the necessary measures to sanction the negligence of the establishment.
“It is absolutely inconceivable that seniors - who can be vulnerable, who sometimes have cognitive deficits, physical limitations and more than limited means of defense - cannot be adequately protected. I am shocked to see the lightness with which Minister Barrette treats this situation; he must request an investigation into the unfortunate events of Saint-Romuald as soon as possible, ”declared Harold LeBel.
“Cases of assault too often make the headlines; action must be taken to prevent such situations from recurring. All school administrators must be vigilant and the minister must ensure that cases of abuse are taken seriously and lack of judgment punished. What we need is a minister who cares first and foremost about patients and protects vulnerable people, such as some seniors. While we are still waiting to know what follow-up will give the government to the report, tabled last spring, on the living conditions of people accommodated in CHSLDs, we ask it to act with diligence. All light must be shed on the assaults that occurred in Saint-Romuald and that all seniors be protected, whether they are housed in the public or in the private sector, ”added Diane Lamarre.
