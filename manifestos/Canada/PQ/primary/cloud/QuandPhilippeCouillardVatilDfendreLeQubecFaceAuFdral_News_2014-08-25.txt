Quebec - Stéphane Bergeron, MP for Verchères and official opposition critic for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, calls on the Liberal government to stand up to Ottawa&#39;s unilateral initiatives on health and infrastructure funding .
“Philippe Couillard first said last week that he agreed with the drop in federal health transfers. Today, Ottawa is closing the door to increased funding for infrastructure. Does Philippe Couillard also resign himself to this issue? The Conservative government is preparing for elections at the expense of the Quebec budget. The Liberal government must say loud and clear that this will not happen like that, ”declared Stéphane Bergeron.
Where is the beautiful collaboration?
While the Couillard government is preparing to make major cuts in Quebec&#39;s public finances, how can we admit that it is candidly depriving itself of significant federal revenue? Could the Liberals go to the trouble of defending Quebec&#39;s interests in Ottawa? It should be noted that the changes proposed by the Conservative government with regard to federal health transfers will result in a shortfall of more than $ 9 billion over 10 years for Quebec&#39;s finances.
“Where is the collaboration touted by the two prime ministers in recent months? Obviously, it is a one-way street; it is Stephen Harper who decides and Philippe Couillard, for his part, obediently accepts decisions that will do very badly for Quebec and its economy. Is Premier Couillard&#39;s federalist profession of faith so profound that it requires him to sit back, without making the slightest request or objection, when the superior interests of Quebec are at stake? », Concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
