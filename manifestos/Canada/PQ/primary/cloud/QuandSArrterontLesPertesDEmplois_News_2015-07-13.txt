Quebec - The member for Jonquière, Sylvain Gaudreault, as well as the member for Chicoutimi, House leader of the official opposition and spokesperson for the economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Stéphane Bédard, deplore the loss of 140 jobs and the permanent closure of the Graphic Packaging Holding cardboard factory in Jonquière.
“Our thoughts are first with the workers and their families. They are having a difficult time and the government must help them, beyond a phone call with Emploi-Québec. History repeats itself once again. The factory was bought for its technology and it will be relocated. This is unacceptable. Remember Novelis, who experienced the same thing in May 2012. This time, what did the Liberal government do to prevent the loss of revolutionary technology and the jobs that go with it to the region? », Declared Sylvain Gaudreault.
“With the Liberal government&#39;s strategy of economic non-intervention, everyone is losing out right now. There is a real haemorrhage in terms of employment, particularly in the regions. The Prime Minister must uncross his arms and act to support job creation. Let him show that he has a vision, because currently everyone doubts it, ”said Stéphane Bédard.
Members are once again asking the Prime Minister to hold a forum on the economy and employment in Quebec, so that everyone works in the same direction. “The Quebec economy is at a standstill, and the government does not know how to act. It is important to meet all the players and listen to them. Quebec must give itself the legal and regulatory means to protect its economic and technological gems. This is called economic nationalism, while successive Liberal governments are in favor of an economic carelessness, which is particularly bad in the regions of Quebec, ”concluded the member for Chicoutimi.
