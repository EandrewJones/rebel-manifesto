Laval– The parliamentary assistant to the Minister responsible for the Status of Women and Member of Parliament for Sainte-Rose, Ms. Suzanne Proulx, announces that she has been mandated by the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labor and Minister Responsible for the Status of Women, Ms. Agnès Maltais, to deepen the reflection of the Government of Quebec on the issue of the hypersexualization of girls, in collaboration with the Secretariat for the Status of Women.
“The sexualization of public space means that young people are more exposed than ever to reductive images of women. However, the internalization of this discourse by our young people is not without consequences for the psychological, physical and sexual health of young girls and adolescents. It is essential that we concern ourselves with this issue and give us the means to act collectively, ”said Ms. Maltais.
“As many studies have shown, hypersexualization can have negative consequences for our daughters. Moreover, this phenomenon is not unrelated to social problems as serious as sexual exploitation and human trafficking. It is therefore important that we interact with civil society actors who are concerned about hypersexualization, ”said Ms. Proulx.
The Minister&#39;s parliamentary assistant will lead four forums this spring across Quebec to enrich the government&#39;s thinking on this subject.
The first forum will be held in Laval on January 30th. It is part of a desire not only to document the situation and identify the issues, but also, more broadly, to mobilize all stakeholders in order to be able to act, collectively, to counter this phenomenon.
