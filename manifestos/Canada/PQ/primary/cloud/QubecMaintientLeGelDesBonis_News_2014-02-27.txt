Quebec - In accordance with its commitment to exercise rigorous control of government spending, the Quebec government is suspending for a fifth consecutive year the granting of performance bonuses provided for under the Policy on performance evaluation and revision of the salaries of holders of higher posts.
“The senior officials appointed by the government do a remarkable job and have enormous responsibilities. This freeze is in no way linked to our assessment of their performance. It is a budgetary decision, which goes hand in hand with the ability of citizens to pay. I hope that the remuneration conditions can be reviewed when the economic situation is more favorable ”, declared the Prime Minister.
Some 700 people are affected by this freeze, primarily deputy ministers, associate deputy ministers or assistants as well as presidents, vice-presidents and members of government agencies. This freeze represents savings of around $ 6 million.
