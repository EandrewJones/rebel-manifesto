Montreal - “Québec solidaire must apologize for the accusations it has leveled against the Parti Québécois candidate in Saint-Jérôme, Pierre Karl Péladeau. He must apologize for using truncated and false information, and for having duped the population by making totally irresponsible remarks, ”declared Pierre Paquette, Parti Québécois candidate in L&#39;Assomption.
“Québec solidaire wanted to attack the Parti Québécois but, in the end, it splashed out on several respected Quebec companies that have subsidiaries registered in Delaware, including Desjardins, Cirque du Soleil, Jean Coutu, Domtar. He also dirtied organizations like Greenpeace, Oxfam and World Vision, also present in this American state, ”added the candidate.
Many companies around the world doing business in the United States are incorporating companies in the State of Delaware because it has adopted corporate laws that are reputable in international markets. This explains why a large number of companies choose to be incorporated.
“Quebec solidaire&#39;s claims are absurd and ridiculous. There are limits to preparing press releases based on botched and baseless research, ”said Pierre Paquette.
“By systematically attacking the Parti Québécois, Québec solidaire is wrong target. The only candidate for the post of prime minister who has put his money in a tax haven is Philippe Couillard. Instead of going after the only progressive party capable of forming a government, Québec solidaire should take the time to apologize to all the organizations that have been sullied by its exit and for having deceived voters with truncated and false information, ”concluded the candidate.
