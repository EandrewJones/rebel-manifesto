Quebec - The MP for Matane and official opposition spokesperson for tourism, Pascal Bérubé, denounces the position taken by the MP for Mercier, Amir Khadir, who opposes the holding of the Grand Prix de Montréal. Indeed, the deputy Khadir will participate next Sunday in a demonstration against the holding of this world-class event which showcases our metropolis.
“Giving up the Montreal Grand Prix means giving up economic spinoffs that would reach nearly $ 100 million. Giving up this major event also means harming the thousands of workers in the hotel, restaurant and business sectors who benefit from these major spinoffs, ”said Pascal Bérubé.
The Member points out that since 1978, the Grand Prix de Montréal has been a source of pride for Quebec. “In addition to a global showcase, the Grand Prix allows Montreal to vibrate intensely. In addition, hundreds of Quebecers from all over Quebec are meeting in the metropolis. In this sense, the participation of Mr. Khadir in a demonstration against the Grand Prix reveals the true face of Quebec solidaire: a party that wants to slow down the economy and employment, &quot;continued Mr. Bérubé.
He deplores the participation of the member for Québec solidaire in this demonstration. “Amir Khadir should work for the economy of the city of Montreal. Without a doubt, several merchants and citizens of his riding benefit from the Montreal Grand Prix. Mr. Khadir should stop harming them, ”concluded Pascal Bérubé.
