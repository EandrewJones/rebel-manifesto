Quebec, August 13, 2014 - The member for Matane-Matapédia and official opposition spokesperson for public security, Pascal Bérubé, wonders about the real reasons for the departure of the Director General of the Sûreté du Québec (SQ) , Mario Laprise.
“Minister Lise Thériault plays with words. What exactly does she blame Mario Laprise for? He had the mandate to collaborate with UPAC and the Charbonneau commission, which obviously produced results. Did the ongoing Liberal Party investigations influence the decision? There is reason to ask the question, ”said Pascal Bérubé.
Let us recall that the Liberal Party had nevertheless supported a motion adopted unanimously on June 13th and reiterating Parliament&#39;s confidence in, in particular, the director general of the SQ, Mario Laprise. Pascal Bérubé believes that despite the crisis of last spring, the way Lise Thériault manages her ministry is still just as bad. &quot;Has the minister found in Mario Laprise a scapegoat for his chaotic management of the escape of prisoners from the Orsainville detention center?&quot; », Continued the spokesperson.
A lack of transparency in the method of appointment The deputy also regrets that Minister Thériault has announced a committee whose members were appointed by decree by the Council of Ministers. “The Prime Minister promised transparency. The appointment process, as well as the creation of the committee and its composition, were all decided behind closed doors, without any consultation with parliamentarians. Once again, the Liberal government has broken one of its promises, ”concluded Pascal Bérubé.
