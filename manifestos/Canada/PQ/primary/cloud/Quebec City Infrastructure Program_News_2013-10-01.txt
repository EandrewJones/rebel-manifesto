La Malbaie - The Premier of Quebec and Member of Parliament for Charlevoix-Côte-de-Beaupré, Pauline Marois, is pleased to announce that the City of La Malbaie will benefit from maximum government financial assistance of $ 2,150,400 for the renewal of water pipes. This assistance comes from the Québec-Municipalities Infrastructure Program (PIQM).
“Every Quebecer must be able to benefit from access to quality public services. That is why my government is committed to providing municipalities with the support they need to renew and develop their infrastructure, ”said the Premier.
More specifically, the project aims to replace drinking water and wastewater pipes under sections of Chemin de la Vallée in La Malbaie. Ultimately, the water pipes will be replaced over nearly 2 kilometers.
Completion of this project requires maximum government financial assistance of $ 2,150,400 under component 1.5 of the PIQM. With a total envelope of $ 462 million, this component of the PIQM not only ensures the sustainability of infrastructure, but also improves the quality of life of the population and creates many jobs in all regions of the Quebec.
The Quebec government&#39;s support for this project is part of the 2013-2023 Quebec Infrastructure Plan (PQI), made public last April. It should be remembered that this ten-year plan will ultimately result in investments of $ 8.1 billion for the municipal infrastructure component. It will have a major economic impact throughout Quebec, with nearly 60,000 jobs created or maintained, on average, per year.
The PQI also marks a shift in the way we invest and manage public infrastructure. This new way of doing things will make it possible to prospectively assess the needs, based on the priorities of Quebecers, to properly measure the associated costs and, thus, to make informed choices.
