Québec, April 28, 2016 - The member for Labelle and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in family matters, Sylvain Pagé, this morning questioned the Minister of Families, Sébastien Proulx, on his decision to impose the target on each childcare center. 80% of the attendance rate, without distinction of the results already obtained and without taking into account the reality of the environment.
“Mr. Proulx will have understood that for a childcare center whose attendance rate is already above 80%, there is no problem. On the other hand, for a childcare center that takes in more vulnerable or sick children, whose parents are separated or have to deal with atypical schedules, the target may be difficult to achieve. For fear of being threatened with financial cuts by the ministry, some childcare centers have even already sent a directive which worries parents, ”declared the member for Labelle.
The directive in question goes as follows:
“When the number of days of absence of the child reaches the permitted limit, the following procedure will be applied. A written notice will be sent to parents by registered mail to terminate the service agreement with 2 weeks notice. &quot;
Tuesday, at a press briefing, the member for Labelle, accompanied by disconcerted parents, had already drawn the attention of the minister and the population to the consequences of this measure for families whose children must be absent more often. Today, Minister Sébastien Proulx affirmed that &quot;the CPEs could not terminate a service agreement because of an insufficient attendance rate&quot;.
“I am reassured for the parents that the minister has finally heard reason. That said, we will remain vigilant. We must make sure that this put forward measure does not cause other concerns for parents, ”concluded Sylvain Pagé.
