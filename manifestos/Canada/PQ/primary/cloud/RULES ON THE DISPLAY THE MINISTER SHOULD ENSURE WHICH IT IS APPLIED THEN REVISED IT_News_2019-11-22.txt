Québec, November 22, 2019 - A few days before the deadline given to businesses to comply with the 2016 billboard regulation, the member for Îles-de-la-Madeleine and the Parti Québécois language spokesperson French, Joël Arseneau, urges the Minister responsible for the French language, Simon Jolin-Barrette, to have it rigorously applied, before improving it to ensure, finally, a predominant presence of French in the linguistic landscape of Quebec.
IN SHORT
Let us first recall that in May 2016, the Liberals adopted a new regulation on commercial signage; businesses had more than three years, ie until November 24, to comply. “However, it is clear that this regulation has considerably weakened the presence of French in the linguistic landscape of Quebec. We no longer impose its predominance; we only speak of a &quot;sufficient presence&quot;. However, this minimum threshold must absolutely be respected, and it is the Minister&#39;s responsibility to ensure this, ”said Joël Arseneau.
The spokesperson is categorical: sanctions must be imposed on businesses caught in default. “In 2018-2019, the OQLF received more than 2,800 complaints, more than half of which concerned public signage or commercial documentation. The CAQ government has an extraordinary opportunity here to prove that its &quot;nationalism&quot; is not just a facade. The Minister must ensure that the OQLF rigorously punishes recalcitrant businesses which, in three years, have not felt it necessary to adjust, to take measures to comply with the law, ”he added.
However, once the current law is implemented, the minister will have to go even further. “Simon Jolin-Barrette is slow to tackle the revision of the rules concerning signage. It must improve them, so that French regains its rights. Because, in Quebec, it is the only official language. If his action plan is vigorous, clear and firm on this point, we may be able to forgive him for the time he took to present it, ”concluded Joël Arseneau.
