Montreal - It is with sadness and dismay that the Parti Québécois learned of the death of a man and a seriously injured person during the electoral rally that took place last night at the Metropolis in Montreal.
“My thoughts are first with the family and loved ones of the deceased victim. Following this tragedy, all Quebecers are in mourning today in the face of such an act of gratuitous violence, ”declared the Member of Parliament for Charlevoix-Côte-de-Beaupré and Premier-elect, Pauline Marois.
“A society like ours will never let violence dictate its collective choices. It is through the democratic voice that we must express ourselves, as Quebeckers were able to do yesterday, ”she concluded, hoping that the injured person would escape unscathed.
