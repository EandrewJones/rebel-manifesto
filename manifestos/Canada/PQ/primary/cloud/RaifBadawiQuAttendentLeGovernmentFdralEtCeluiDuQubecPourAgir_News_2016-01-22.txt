Quebec– MP Carole Poirier, spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in international relations, as well as Maka Kotto, spokesperson in immigration and cultural communities, and Stéphane Bergeron, spokesperson in Quebec relations? Canada, deplore that the federal government refused to grant Canadian citizenship to Raif Badawi, while last June, the Quebec government issued him his Quebec selection certificate.
“In December, Federal Minister Stéphane Dion demanded clemency for the imprisoned blogger. Justin Trudeau said for his part that his desire to resolve the case of Raif Badawi was unwavering. He even spoke of appealing to the King of Saudi Arabia! Today, he says he fears that relations between Canada and Saudi Arabia, including an important arms contract, will be jeopardized if Canada grants citizen status to Mr. Badawi. What happened? », Asked Carole Poirier.
“How can Ottawa hold such a speech? It is absurd and far, far from the signals sent many times by Quebeckers. Since Raif Badawi&#39;s imprisonment, they have also strongly expressed their support for him, as well as for his family, established in Sherbrooke. What more do they need to move in Ottawa? », Added Maka Kotto.
Stéphane Bergeron adds that the Minister of Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, Jean-Marc Fournier, must act quickly and make it clear to the federal government that it must follow suit with Quebec, which has already deployed exceptional measures to repatriate Raif Badawi. “We call on the government of Justin Trudeau to show diligence and compassion on this file. Besides, what is his strategy to free Raif Badawi? Does he have a plan? This fall, Justin Trudeau pledged to put pressure on Saudi Arabia. What is he waiting for? », Concluded the deputy.
