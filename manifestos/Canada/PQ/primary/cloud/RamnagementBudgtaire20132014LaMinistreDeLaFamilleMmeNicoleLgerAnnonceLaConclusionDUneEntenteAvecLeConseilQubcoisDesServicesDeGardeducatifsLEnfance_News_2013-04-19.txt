Quebec - The Minister of Families, Ms. Nicole Léger, announces that following positive and fruitful discussions, an agreement has been reached with the Quebec Council of Educational Childcare Services (CQSGEE). This agreement covers the budgetary reorganization measures planned in the network of early childhood centers (CPE) for the 2013-2014 fiscal year.
“Over the past few weeks, we have shown openness to our partners by forming a working group to enable them to come up with other solutions. This approach allows us today to announce an agreement with the CQSGEE. Throughout these discussions, it was essential to remain firm on the objectives of the budgetary adjustment for 2013-2014, while remaining open on the points of view expressed and flexible on the means, ”declared Minister Nicole Léger.
The agreement concluded by the government and the CQSGEE means that the Ministry sets up a greater recovery of the accumulated surpluses of the CPEs and that the funding scale for 4-year-old children is abandoned. In addition, a round table will be created with the aim of ensuring the sustainability and optimization of the financing of childcare centers.
“This is good news for everyone, as we are achieving the requested budget target and accepting the proposed accommodations. Childcare centers play an essential role in our society, the creation of 28,000 places by 2016 continues and remains a priority for our government, ”said Minister Nicole Léger.
