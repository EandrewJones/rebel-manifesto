Quebec - The Minister of Families, Ms. Nicole Léger, announces that an agreement in principle has been reached with the Rassemblement des garderies privée du Québec (RGPQ). This agreement relates to the budgetary reorganization measures planned in the network of subsidized daycare centers for the 2013-2014 fiscal year.
“Following discussions held in a positive atmosphere, the RGPQ clearly demonstrated a desire to resolve the current situation. A reasonable accommodation proposal was made by its representatives in order to reach the target of $ 14.9 million this year. After analysis, I accepted this arrangement, ”declared Minister Nicole Léger.
[Remember that this effort is for 2013-2014 only, that the funding scale for four-year-old children is abandoned and that subsidized daycares were able to participate in the targeted call for projects to quickly create a maximum of 1,000 new places. starting next fall (http://pq.org/blogue/garderies-privees-subventionnees-faire-le-point/)
“It has always been essential for us to remain firm on the objective of 14.9 million in 2013-2014, but open to dialogue on possible arrangements. Subsidized child care centers are important partners of the government. By maintaining a respectful dialogue, we have reached an agreement that is good news for everyone, ”said Minister Nicole Léger.
