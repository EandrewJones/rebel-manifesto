Quebec - During a radio interview on the sidelines of the caucus of Liberal MPs this morning, the leader of the Liberal Party of Quebec, Philippe Couillard, confirmed the words of the Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the territory, Sylvain Gaudreault.
During this interview on CIEL-FM, Mr. Couillard affirmed that &quot;at the time of construction, the plans and specifications completed, there, you make the budget for the section that remains&quot;, thus confirming that the the former government had not invested a penny in carrying out the redevelopment work on Route 185, between Saint-Antonin and Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!.
“In addition to demonstrating a profound ignorance of the planning of work at the MTQ, Philippe Couillard confirms the sad reality that the former Liberal government has tried to cover up somehow for several months. The sums for this portion of the redevelopment of Route 185 were not there, despite the statements of the MNA for Rivière-du-Loup-Témiscouata, Jean D&#39;Amour, ”notes Minister Gaudreault.
Mr. Gaudreault also sent a letter yesterday to the deputy D&#39;Amour asking him to rectify the facts concerning the redevelopment project of Route 185 while reiterating the desire of the Government of Quebec to finalize the work.
&quot;In front of the words of his leader, the deputy D&#39;Amour must set the record straight to the population and collaborate in good faith to move this important file for the citizens of Bas-Saint-Laurent&quot;, concluded the Minister of Transport.
