“The new Federal Minister of Transport, Ms. Raitt, confirmed my claims. Without knowing the terms of the new federal infrastructure programs, it is impossible to move forward on the file. I told my counterpart about the funding and security issues surrounding the completion of phase 3 of the redevelopment of route 85 between Saint-Antonin and Saint-Louis-du-Ha! -Ha !. This project is important for the Government of Quebec, but above all for the people of Bas-Saint-Laurent, ”said Minister Gaudreault.
It should be remembered that the Government of Quebec is still waiting for the terms of application of the funds reserved for infrastructure from Ottawa. This is an essential condition for the achievement of this last phase.
“I also mentioned to Ms. Raitt that I also intended to discuss the file with her minister colleague, Mr. Denis Lebel, on September 27, in Gatineau during a ministerial meeting. We are making this file a priority, ”concluded Mr. Gaudreault.
