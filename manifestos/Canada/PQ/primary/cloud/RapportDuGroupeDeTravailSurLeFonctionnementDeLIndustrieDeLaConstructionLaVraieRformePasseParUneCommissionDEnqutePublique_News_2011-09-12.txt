Quebec - The MNA for René-Lévesque and official opposition spokesperson for labor, Marjolain Dufour, believes that the real reform needed in the construction industry must first and foremost go through a commission of public survey.
“Once again, the Liberal government is going backwards! He argues that the construction industry needs to change, but refuses to make a clear diagnosis. As long as the public inquiry commission has not been set up, everything else remains a window dressing and evacuates the real issues, ”said Marjolain Dufour.
The member for René-Lévesque was hardly surprised that the minister heard tabling another bill in the fall. “The Liberal government wants to give the impression that it is in action mode because Operation Marteau and the ten or so bills introduced and adopted over the past two years have produced nothing. It is also eloquent proof that Bill 73 is full of holes, ”he added.
&quot;The obvious is obvious: we want to shake up the system and the unions to give the impression that the government is acting, but in reality, unfortunately, we are missing out on real business,&quot; concluded Marjolain Dufour.
