Quebec - The member for Taillon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of health and access to care, Diane Lamarre, denounces the additional privileges still granted to doctors by the Minister of Health.
The Auditor General&#39;s report confirms that the Liberal government is offering gift after gift to doctors, without obtaining any improvement in access to care. They were paid $ 416 million more than expected: $ 32 million to family physicians and $ 384 million to specialists.
“In summary, the amounts paid to physicians exceeded the planned amounts, and the overruns therefore had to be paid for out of the envelopes of the other programs. During that time, the health network suffered cuts of $ 220 million for 2014-2015 and $ 450 million for 2015-2016. Public health, prevention, home care, social services - and so on - have had to pay these $ 416 million in extras to doctors, ”said the MP.
The Auditor General also concludes that Minister Barrette took advantage of the staggering agreements to add, unbeknownst to all, $ 148.5 million for physicians. How can he dare to give them even more? It will never be enough. The Minister of Health overestimated the salary increases to be spread by $ 148.5 million, increases that he himself had negotiated with Philippe Couillard in 2007, then with Yves Bolduc in 2011.
“In short, Minister Barrette brazenly granted yet another pay hike to doctors. No savings for the government, no more access for patients, but $ 416 million more for doctors. Is this the Liberal solution to improve access? Unfortunately for patients, there has been nothing for them for 18 months, and they will still have to wait, ”concluded the deputy.
