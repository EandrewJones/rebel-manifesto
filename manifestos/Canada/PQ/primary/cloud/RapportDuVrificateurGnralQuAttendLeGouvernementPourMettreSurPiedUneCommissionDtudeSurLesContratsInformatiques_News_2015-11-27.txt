Quebec - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for information resources, Guy Leclair, notes that once again, in a damning report, the Auditor General highlights the serious shortcomings in the process of awarding IT contracts to the government.
Unveiled this morning, the Auditor General&#39;s report is devastating on the government&#39;s management of IT contracts. He is the third to sound the alarm. It reads that the independence and impartiality of the selection committees are not guaranteed, that the suppliers assume only a small part of the risks because of the structure of the contracts, that the terms of the contracts, often, do not. are not respected and that recourse to the private sector is generalized, even when it is a strategic decision. In short, the Auditor General believes that the government is not in control. Consequently, Quebecers must assume the increased costs, ”said Guy Leclair.
In order to resolve the problem once and for all, the Parti Québécois is asking the government to set up a study commission on computer contracts in Quebec. &quot; Hurry up. Quebecers have already seen enough of their money being swallowed up in the bottomless pits that computer contracts have become. A study commission would allow us to understand why things are going badly, why the government has found itself completely dependent on external expertise, why it costs Quebecers so much, and to find solutions, ”added the Member for Beauharnois. .
“I call on the Liberal government to act now. If he refuses to set up this study commission, Quebeckers will understand, like us, that he undoubtedly has something to hide or someone to protect, ”concluded Guy Leclair.
