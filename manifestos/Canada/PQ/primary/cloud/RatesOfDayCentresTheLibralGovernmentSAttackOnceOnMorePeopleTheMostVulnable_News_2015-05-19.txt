Quebec - The member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, Jean-François Lisée, denounces the staggering increase in tariffs that the government intends to impose on seniors and people with disabilities, among others for the service of adapted transport allowing them to attend the day centers of the Quebec health and social services network.
“Day centers are places where seniors and people with disabilities go a few times a week to help them stay independent. The fact that these people stay at home costs Quebec society less and, above all, that is what they want. The paratransit service could cost the equivalent of a metro ticket, approximately. However, we learn that it will increase to $ 10 for everyone. Why is the government imposing such a price shock on seniors and people with disabilities in Quebec? It is indefensible, ”said Jean-François Lisée.
The MP points out that in December, the Prime Minister made a commitment to stop increasing tariffs in order to balance the budget, admitting that taxpayers had done more than their fair share. In this case, however, we are talking about an increase of up to 600% for paratransit, and up to 87% for meals offered in day centers. “What happened to Philippe Couillard&#39;s good intentions? Let us remember how the Minister of Health and Social Services, Gaétan Barrette, had to back down on the issue of CHSLD rates; currently, we really have the impression that he wants to pass the shortfall on to seniors and people with disabilities, ”he added.
“Day centers are beneficial to both patients and their family caregivers, who thus find a little respite. The Prime Minister must make Gaétan Barrette listen to reason and call on him to renounce these unacceptable rate increases, ”concluded Jean-François Lisée.
