Quebec - The member for Blainville and official opposition spokesperson for municipal affairs, Daniel Ratthé, believes that the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Laurent Lessard, must quickly table a proposal that would modify the criteria for representativeness.
&quot;Given the reflection initiated within several municipal councils on representativeness, we believe that it is up to Minister Lessard to present to the National Assembly a proposal for changes to the criteria and he must proceed quickly so that the debate can take place. starts this fall, ”said Daniel Ratthé.
Last week in parliamentary committee, Minister Laurent Lessard opened the door to modify the criteria of representativeness. “These criteria have not been reviewed since 1987. It is in the order of things to adapt our laws to the new realities of today,” added MP Ratthé. However, to accede to municipal demands for the reduction of the number of elected officials, we cannot do so without the support clearly expressed by the population, the strong majority will of the municipal councils and the respect of the criteria which will be set out in the law ” , insists the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois.
The member for Blainville also emphasizes that it is imperative that this issue be addressed immediately in order to modify the municipal districts, if necessary. If Minister Lessard does not move quickly, it will be too late for these changes to be effective as of the next municipal elections in 2013. “The population would hardly understand that the government postpones the municipal elections of 2017, that is to say in six years, the fruit. a reflection which is quite advanced in many municipalities at present, ”continued the deputy.
For the Parti Québécois, the Liberal government must allow these changes to all municipalities on this crucial issue of representativeness because emergency laws cannot become the norm. &quot;The ball is in Minister Lessard&#39;s court,&quot; concluded Daniel Ratthé.
