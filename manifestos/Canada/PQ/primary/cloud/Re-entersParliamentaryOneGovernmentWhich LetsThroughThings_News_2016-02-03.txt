Quebec - On the sidelines of the presessional caucus of the Parti Québécois deputies, the leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, and the parliamentary leader, Bernard Drainville, insisted on the priorities of the Parti Québécois for the next session: the economy, education and families in Quebec. In addition, in addition to austerity, they also denounced the government&#39;s laissez-faire, which has become its habit and its trademark.
“The impacts of the economic inaction of the government of Philippe Couillard are felt everywhere in Quebec. The indicators are on the decline, as are jobs. There are more unemployed people today than when the Liberals came to power. Today, we lose another head office, that of Rona, and the government of inertia lets it go, once again. The Prime Minister, who is not interested in the economy, persists in inaction. When will we have a real economic development policy? “Asked Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“The members of the Parti Québécois will continue to fight this austerity which hurts. We will fight on behalf of families, children, middle class people and those in the regions. Austerity is not a social project! We will also continue to demand a real economic vision, a real enrichment plan for Quebecers. Our leader, Pierre Karl Péladeau, is the perfect person to lead this battle, and to push this government to put forward lasting solutions rather than letting the problems rot, as it is currently doing, ”added Bernard for his part. Drainville.
“We are going to continue our work on the ground, close to Quebecers, in order to know their aspirations. That is the job of the official opposition. And it is only us to do it, everywhere, in all regions of Quebec. The economy, education and families will be our priorities for the coming weeks, ”concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
