Quebec– The member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, invites the Liberal government to take advantage of the holiday season to reconnect with the population. In fact, in light of the Prime Minister&#39;s end-of-year interviews, he judges that he has adopted the tactic of denial of reality, by distancing himself even further from the families, regions and workers of Quebec.
“Far from the reality of their environment and each in his own tower, the ministers govern in a vacuum. They do not speak to partners and maintain an atmosphere of permanent confrontation in all sectors. We all remember the climates of social tension created from scratch by the liberals, and we don&#39;t want to replay in this bad movie. The ministers&#39; priority must be to reconnect with families, regions and workers. Reconnect with the reality of the population! », Declared Stéphane Bédard.
An astonishing admission
The leader of the official opposition also points out that the Prime Minister has made an astonishing admission, according to which it is the New York credit agencies that control Quebec&#39;s public finances. What is more, Philippe Couillard affirms that they rely on the Auditor General&#39;s report. However, we now know that this report is not credible, since it is based on theoretical figures.
“The Prime Minister must assume that the state of Quebec&#39;s indebtedness and the bad budgetary choices are largely due to the nine-year reign of the Liberal government, of which he was a part. May he assume his responsibilities and the choices he makes now. Quebec families and regions do not have to pay for Philippe Couillard&#39;s bad decisions, ”concluded Stéphane Bédard.
