Lévis - The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, is pleased to announce that today work begins on a third site for the reconstruction of the route 112 between Thetford Mines and Saint-Joseph-de-Coleraine.
“The start of this third project certainly confirms that the reconstruction of Route 112 is on the right track. This new project is in addition to the two others already underway, namely the clearing of the dumps and the construction of the bridge that spans the Bécancour River. Moreover, these two projects, which began last August, are continuing and progressing, ”said Minister Sylvain Gaudreault.
The work will take place in the wooded sector, located in the western part of the route, over a length of 5.4 kilometers. The work will consist of earthworks, drainage, asphalting, retaining devices, landscaping and road lighting of the intersection with Chemin du Lac Caribou.
Remember that in order to speed up the construction of the new section, the project is divided into four sections, which will be worked on simultaneously. In fact, from west to east, the wooded (5.4 km), mining (4 km), the Bécancour river bridge and urban (1 km) sectors will be treated independently. The objective remains that the new route 112 be operational in the fall of 2015.
