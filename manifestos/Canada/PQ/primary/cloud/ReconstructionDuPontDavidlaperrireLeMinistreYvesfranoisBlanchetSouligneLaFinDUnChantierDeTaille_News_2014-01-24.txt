Trois-Rivières– Yves-François Blanchet, Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks and Minister responsible for the Mauricie and Center-du-Québec regions, on behalf of the Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, wishes to salute the success of a major project, namely the reconstruction of the David-Laperrière bridge, spanning the Saint-François River, on route 132.
This large-scale project, which required investments in the order of $ 60 million, posed a major challenge: to build a structure adapted to needs while preserving the road link during the work.
“The challenge was met on time and on cost, and with the constant support of the community, which worked in concert with the Department. This collaboration resulted in the active participation of representatives of Odanak, Saint-François-du-Lac and Pierreville in a traffic management committee, by the production of a documentary under the supervision of the Société historique de the Pierreville region, as well as by preparing an exhibition on the history of the bridge at the Musée des Abénakis, ”declared Mr. Blanchet.
Begun in April 2011, the reconstruction work on the David-Laperrière bridge was completed in November 2013. The project aimed in particular to restore the functionality of the road link to users of route 132, mainly by eliminating the load limit on the bridge.
&quot;This prestigious bridge by its size and its history represents the link uniting three proud and dynamic communities, which now ensure the enhancement of the history of the old bridge, dating from 1932&quot;, concluded Minister Blanchet.
