Quebec - The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announces a significant reduction in the time limit for resorting to the surety in the event of a contractor&#39;s failure to comply to its contractual obligations. The Department will henceforth be able to avail itself of the performance bond 48 hours after the formal notice served on the contractor to ensure the continuation of a site, whereas a period of 15 days was previously required. This change is intended to ensure that the work schedules are respected and to limit the impact on road users.
“Following the impromptu stoppage of some construction sites in the metropolitan region in recent weeks, I am making this strong gesture to provide the Ministry with effective and rapid intervention tools, and thus improve contractual management by ensuring of the execution within the initially foreseen deadlines. Road users will benefit, ”said Minister Gaudreault.
This modification will be incorporated into all public calls for tenders relating to construction work contracts for which the opening of tenders will be held as of today.
Remember that the Ministry of Transport requires guarantees in the form of performance bonds for all construction work contracts that are the subject of a public call for tenders. In the event of default by a contractor, the Ministry may appeal to the surety, who then assumes the obligations provided for in the contract.
