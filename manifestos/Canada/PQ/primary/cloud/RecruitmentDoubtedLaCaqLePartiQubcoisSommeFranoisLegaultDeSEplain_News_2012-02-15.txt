Quebec– The member for Chambly and deputy leader of the official opposition, Bertrand St-Arnaud, summons François Legault to explain the offer he is making to aspiring CAQ members during his recruitment interviews.
In a report broadcast on Radio-Canada radio last week, a candidate approached by the CAQ openly admits to having been offered a job in the public service, from his first interview. “Not only does this bring out the arrogance of François Legault, but in addition, it is against the law which provides that hiring in the public service is by competition. With the CAQ of François Legault, the expertise of the public service would take the edge and it is the political affiliation which would prevail ”, denounced Bertrand St-Arnaud.
The deputy recalls that article 42 of the Civil Service Act is clear: Civil servants are recruited and promoted by competitive examination. &quot;You can read and reread the law as you like, nowhere is it mentioned that a party leader has the opportunity to offer a job in the public service when he is recruited on the eve of a campaign. electoral ”, adds the member for Chambly.
For the Parti Québécois, such disregard for the laws of Quebec is worrying on the part of a political party that supports doing things properly. “This dubious recruitment campaign takes us back 50 years to the Duplessis era. Patronage, Quebeckers do not want it. François Legault cannot hide as he did with his equally questionable funding. He must explain himself, ”concluded Bertrand St-Arnaud.
