Quebec - The Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Daniel Breton, today celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the election of the government of Jean Lesage, whose slogan was: &quot; Masters in your own house &quot;. This expression has since become emblematic of the Quiet Revolution and of Quebec&#39;s entry into modernity.
Remember that the 1962 election kicked off a project that was to become a turning point in Quebec history: the nationalization of electricity. This vast project brought with it a wind of renewal which greatly contributed to forging the Quebec identity. Today it is a source of inspiration for many Quebecers for whom it symbolizes the spirit of entrepreneurship, the sense of innovation and the mark of a young and daring nation.
“Even after all these years, it is this same spirit that drives our government today. It is time to reclaim our heritage and become the true trustees of our natural and energy resources. We all know that Quebec has incredible potential; it is therefore only natural that Quebecers should be the first beneficiaries, ”the Minister indicated.
“Unlike our predecessors, we are betting on Quebec and its many resources. It is for this reason that we want to put an end to all the uncertainties linked to the development of the North. We want a &quot;North for all&quot;, which will benefit society as a whole, rather than a few foreign multinationals. This second phase of the Masters at home will also involve the acquisition of greater energy independence and the electrification of transport. It is this vision that will allow us to become Masters at home again ”, concluded the Minister.
