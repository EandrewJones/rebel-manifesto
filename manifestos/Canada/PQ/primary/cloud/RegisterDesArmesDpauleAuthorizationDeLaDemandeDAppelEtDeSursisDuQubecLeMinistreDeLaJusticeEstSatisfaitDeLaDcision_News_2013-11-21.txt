Quebec - The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, is satisfied with the decision of the Supreme Court, which welcomes Quebec&#39;s request to appeal the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the destruction of Quebec data from the long gun registry.
“This authorization from the Supreme Court will allow us to assert our point of view regarding Quebec&#39;s right to obtain data from the long-gun registry concerning Quebeckers. We also welcome the Supreme Court ruling which maintains the obligation to record data until a final decision is rendered. This will ensure that the register will have up-to-date data and that it will not become obsolete while the Supreme Court renders its decision, ”said the Minister of Justice.
It should be remembered that the Court of Appeal concluded that the abolition of the long gun registry by the federal government was valid, hence Quebec&#39;s desire to appeal this judgment.
Until the Supreme Court renders its decision, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec will reserve his comments, pending the decision of this court of last instance.
