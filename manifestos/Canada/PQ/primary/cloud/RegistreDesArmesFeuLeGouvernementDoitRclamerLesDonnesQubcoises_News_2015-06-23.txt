Quebec - In light of this important development of bringing Quebec data from the firearms registry to justice, the Member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, once again calls on the Liberal government to immediately demand that the federal government provide it with this data.
“We have proof of this today: the data concerning Quebec still exist on an external hard drive. The only reason that can explain Ottawa&#39;s refusal to send them to us is bad faith, ”said the member for Verchères.
Mr. Bergeron reminds that Quebeckers are in a way the owners of this data, since they have paid to collect it. “It is in particular thanks to the taxes paid by Quebeckers that we have been able to collect the information contained in the federal register. It is therefore entirely legitimate and desirable to claim them, which the Government of Quebec would do immediately if it stood up to Ottawa at all. The opportunity offered to him today is unexpected and, if he does not seize it, he will have demonstrated his negligence and his indifference to seeing Quebecers pay a second time to collect the same data ”, a he continued.
“Do not look for noon to two o&#39;clock; if the Harper government has so far refused to give these data to Quebec, it is for purely ideological reasons, and therefore inadmissible. Premier Couillard and his ministers must immediately call on the Canadian government and demand the immediate transmission of Quebec data from the federal firearms registry, ”concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
