Québec, March 1, 2019 - The member for Jonquière and spokesperson for the second opposition group on energy, Sylvain Gaudreault, has announced that he will sponsor and support a petition asking the government of François Legault to reimburse Quebecers the $ 1.7 billion overpaid by Hydro ‑ Quebec.
IN SHORT
Hydro-Québec, a Crown corporation, belongs to all Quebecers; Sylvain Gaudreault believes that as such, she cannot keep this money in her coffers. “Since 2005, Quebec consumers have paid nearly $ 1.7 billion in excess to Hydro-Quebec, even though they are technically owners. This money must come back to them in full. There is no other way to look at the situation, ”he argued.
The spokesperson recalled that the CAQ shared this point of view when it was in opposition. “The caquists were screaming in the House to demand a full refund of overpayments. Even in 2017, through a petition, the CAQ member for Saint-Hyacinthe, Chantal Soucy, had collected more than 47,000 signatures to this effect! What happened to make the CAQ change its mind in this way? Is it simply because she took power? This turnaround is totally incomprehensible and unacceptable, ”he insisted.
“During the 39 days that the electoral campaign lasted, François Legault insisted that he wanted to put money back in the pockets of citizens. Today he has a golden opportunity to honor his promise. His government must amend the law to force Hydro-Québec to return 100% of overpayments to Quebecers, ”concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
