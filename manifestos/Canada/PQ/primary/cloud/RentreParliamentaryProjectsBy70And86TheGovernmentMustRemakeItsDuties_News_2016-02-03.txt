Quebec - This morning at a press briefing, Alexandre Cloutier, spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in education, and Dave Turcotte, spokesperson in employment and solidarity, made requests to the new ministers of the government to Philippe Couillard, as well as to the Prime Minister himself: the Liberal government must review its priorities and put aside Bills 70 and 86.
“After having reshuffled his cabinet, the Prime Minister must now redefine his priorities for action. While our schools are falling apart, Quebec continues to lag behind in graduation and student services are cut everywhere, the Liberal government is getting lost with a bill that will in no way improve school success. The Minister of Education should put Bill 86 aside and focus on the real issues. There is a way to give more power to parents without going through all this mixing of structures, ”said Alexandre Cloutier.
For his part, Dave Turcotte insisted on the importance, for the new Minister of Employment, of clarifying his positions. “On the one hand, François Blais finds himself forced to plead for a reform of social assistance which plans to impose sanctions on providers, while, on the other hand, he puts forward the idea of a guaranteed minimum income. Faced with such a paradox, Bill 70 must be withdrawn, since it becomes obsolete. That the government redo its homework and take the opportunity to launch the necessary social debate on the guaranteed minimum income, ”he demanded.
One thing is certain, the parliamentary session which will begin soon will keep the members of the official opposition busy. “Let the government take it for granted: it is either attacking the real priorities of education and jobs, or it will constantly have us behind. Until he hears, we will remind him that the Quebec of tomorrow will be rich if today&#39;s young people succeed in school and find quality jobs, ”concluded the deputies.
