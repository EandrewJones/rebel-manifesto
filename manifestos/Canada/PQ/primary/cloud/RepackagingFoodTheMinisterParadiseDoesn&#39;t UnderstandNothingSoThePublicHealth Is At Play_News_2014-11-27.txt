Quebec - The member for Berthier and official opposition critic for food, André Villeneuve, is surprised by the statements of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Paradis, who wants to ban the repacking of meat in grocery stores, following the broadcast of a Radio-Canada report on the subject.
“The minister does not understand anything. The solution he advocates, which is to ban repacking, outright, would be harmful to food safety. In effect, doing so would prevent retailers from ensuring clean packaging by removing liquids that have spilled into it. The consumer is not at risk from repackaging the product; what is dangerous is when you change the date indicated on the packaging, ”said André Villeneuve.
The MP points out that the solution to the situation denounced in the Radio-Canada report lies in compliance with the laws and regulations in force. “The problem is that the current law is not always respected. However, the application of the law is the responsibility of the minister. He must ensure that the austerity imposed by his government will not prevent his ministry from sending a sufficient number of inspectors on the ground to check if the law is respected, ”he added.
