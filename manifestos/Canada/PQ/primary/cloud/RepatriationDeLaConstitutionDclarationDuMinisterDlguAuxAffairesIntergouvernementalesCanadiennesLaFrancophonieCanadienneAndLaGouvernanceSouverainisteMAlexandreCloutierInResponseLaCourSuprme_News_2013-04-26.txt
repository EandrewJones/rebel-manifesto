Almaâ€“ The Quebec government is disappointed with the Supreme Court&#39;s summary review which leaves many questions unanswered.
Significant violations of basic democratic principles were mentioned by Professor Bastien and the Government of Quebec intends to act on the unanimous motion of the National Assembly calling for full light to be shed on the events that led to the proclamation of the Constitutional Law of 1982.
The Quebec government will provide further comments on Monday.
