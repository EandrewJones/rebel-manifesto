Quebec - Following the publication of the letter from Commissioner Renaud Lachance, the leader of the official opposition and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of ethics and integrity, Bernard Drainville, once again calls on the Liberal Party to &#39;&#39; agree to his request so that the members of the Committee on Institutions (CI) can hear the President of the Commission on the awarding and management of public contracts in the construction industry (CEIC), France Charbonneau, as well as Commissioner Renaud Lachance.
The leader of the official opposition asked, on December 10, that the President of the CEIC, France Charbonneau, as well as Commissioner Renaud Lachance, be heard before the members of the CI as soon as possible. The other opposition parties have also asked to hear the commissioners. “The questions that Quebeckers ask themselves remain unresolved. We have to get to the bottom of things. All light must be shed on the reasons which prompted Renaud Lachance to dissociate himself from the France Charbonneau report, especially with regard to the financing of the Liberal Party of Quebec, ”indicated Bernard Drainville.
“The commission of inquiry lasted more than 4 years and did not reach unanimous conclusions on an essential aspect of its mandate, namely the financing of political parties. It is not trivial. We must do everything to understand what happened and ensure that this exercise, which will have cost Quebecers $ 45 million, allows us to obtain the truth, ”concluded the spokesperson.
