Quebec City, December 21, 2016 - In light of the conclusions of the Lobbyists Commissioner&#39;s investigation into Premier Tech, the Parti Québécois spokesperson for ethics and integrity, Agnès Maltais, reiterates that Sam Hamad cannot not be reappointed to the Council of Ministers.
&quot;After the Ethics and Professional Conduct Commissioner, who emphasized that Sam Hamad had committed&quot; a breach of the values of righteousness, convenience, wisdom and justice of the National Assembly &quot;, it is now the Commissioner lobbying, which announces that three statements of offense have been served in connection with its investigation into Premier Tech. This report is another nail in the political coffin of Sam Hamad, who claimed a return to the Council of Ministers ”, estimates Agnès Maltais.
“This is also further proof that, contrary to what the Prime Minister said last fall, the ethical problems of the Quebec Liberal Party are not a thing of the past. Since the start of his mandate, Philippe Couillard has been constantly confronted with shortcomings in this area, ”added the spokesperson.
The Lobbyists Commissioner has ruled: in the Premier Tech affair, former Liberal fundraiser Marc Yvan Côté engaged in illegal lobbying; he took advantage of the ethical largesse of Sam Hamad - then Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, then Minister of Transport - to unduly influence him. “This finding confirms, once again, that Mr. Hamad violated basic ethical principles regarding the management of public funds. The Ethics Commissioner came to the same conclusion in his report of June 2016, said Agnès Maltais. Sam Hamad has lost all credibility; he cannot in any case return to the Council of Ministers. &quot;
