Québec– The MNA for Taillon and official opposition spokesperson for health and access to care, Diane Lamarre, and the MNA for Duplessis and spokesperson for seniors, Lorraine Richard, deplore the fact that 2003 to 2012, the situation of seniors in emergencies has not improved.
In his report, the Health and Welfare Commissioner tells us that 60% of emergency room visits could be avoided if the elderly had access to better care outside the emergency room. However - and this is the most worrying thing - the government has no plan to deal with the aging of the population with which the health network must contend.
“The Liberal record is disastrous for our seniors. How can we conceive of these people, already vulnerable, being kept on stretchers in the corridors? Some even give up on treatment altogether, given the often degrading conditions observed in the emergency room, ”said Diane Lamarre.
The Member for Duplessis, for her part, recalls that the situation experienced by the elderly is at the heart of the problems of emergencies. The Parti Québécois had clearly identified the problem; that is why he had invested time and effort in prioritizing and improving home care, deploying family medicine groups and increasing the use of other health professionals.
&quot;Seniors must have access to care upstream and downstream of the emergency, in all regions of Quebec, in order to prevent too many people from ending up there because they do not. not receive the appropriate follow-up. The government must bring back our policy on home care, essential to deal with the aging of the population, ”added Lorraine Richard.
