Quebec City, December 14, 2017 - Following the tabling of the report of the Commission of Inquiry on the Protection of the Confidentiality of Journalistic Sources, the Leader of the Official Opposition, Jean-François Lisée, made the following statement:
“The Commission has clearly validated the version of the facts constantly reiterated by our colleague MP for Verchères, Stéphane Bergeron, about a police investigation initiated by the Sûreté du Québec in September 2013. Then Minister of Public Security, Mr. Bergeron a acted with the transparency and integrity that everyone recognizes and did not exert any political pressure on the police, contrary to what some claimed, without being able to provide proof.
The report is very specific on this point: &quot;There is no conclusive evidence here to say that an elected official intervened to ask to institute, suspend or abandon a criminal investigation, or to give any directive whether in relation to such an investigation. &quot;
In the Parti Québécois, we have always maintained that the integrity of our colleague was flawless and are happy to see this conviction validated by the Chamberland commission. On the substance of the proposals, we will study the report carefully. However, from the outset, we indicate our full openness to collaborate in order to improve the protection of journalistic sources, for the good and health of our democratic society. &quot;
