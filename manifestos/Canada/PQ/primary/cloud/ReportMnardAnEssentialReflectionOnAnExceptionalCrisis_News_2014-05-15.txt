Quebec - The MNA for Matane-Matapédia and official opposition spokesperson for public security, Pascal Bérubé, takes note of the report of the Special Committee to Examine the Events of Spring 2012, which makes important findings on a crisis exceptional. It invites the government to act on it by carefully analyzing the recommendations made therein.
“The Liberals did not want the Commission. However, the thorough and substantial report that she submitted deserves that all the stakeholders take cognizance of it. The Couillard government has a duty to act on them. We could not do without this kind of thinking. It is not a question of calling into question the work of the police; the report goes much further and prompts us to conduct a much broader analysis, ”said Pascal Bérubé.
The report makes various recommendations on the tools made available to the police, as well as on the organization and training of police officers. There are also observations on the groups of demonstrators and the various organizations which have to intervene in several ways on the scene of a demonstration.
Pascal Bérubé particularly draws the government&#39;s attention to the very last lines of the report. The government is invited to take advantage of the lull period to &quot;bring together all the actors concerned in order to agree on a new democratic framework for the right to peaceful demonstration&quot;.
“This consultation is essential in order to coordinate the actions of all stakeholders: the police, emergency services and demonstrators. The right to demonstrate peacefully is a right recognized in our society; let&#39;s take the time to review all of its aspects, ”concluded the member for Matane-Matapédia.
