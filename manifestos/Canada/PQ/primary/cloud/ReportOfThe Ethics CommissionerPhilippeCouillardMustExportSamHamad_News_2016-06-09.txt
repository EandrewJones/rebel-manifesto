Quebec - Reacting to the report of the Ethics Commissioner on the Sam Hamad affair, the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of ethics and integrity, Bernard Drainville, takes note of his conclusion, according to which Sam Hamad committed &quot;a breach of the values of righteousness, convenience, wisdom and justice of the National Assembly&quot;.
“Faced with a damning second report on the subsidy granted to Premier Tech under the authority of Sam Hamad, the Prime Minister has no choice but to expel his deputy from the caucus. The Commissioner writes that &quot;Mr. Hamad&#39;s behavior is not simply imprudence, but constitutes a failure which harms the maintenance of the confidence of the population in the members of the National Assembly&quot;. For his part, Sam Hamad no longer has the legitimacy to continue to sit as a deputy. If he refuses to resign, it is all elected officials, all Quebecers who will lose out, ”said Bernard Drainville.
However, the Ethics Commissioner, who &quot;cannot ignore the many elements which raise serious questions as to the possibility that Mr. Sam Hamad has placed himself in a situation of conflict of interest&quot;, &quot;does not submit any recommendation as to a sanction that could be imposed ”.
“The Prime Minister therefore has all the latitude he needs to crack down on his MP. Philippe Couillard must absolutely expel Sam Hamad from the caucus. It is the credibility of the National Assembly that is at stake, ”concluded the spokesperson.
