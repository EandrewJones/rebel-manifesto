Quebec - The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, denounces the remarks of the leader of the Liberal Party of Quebec, Mr. Philippe Couillard, who at a press briefing yesterday, trivialized the observations made in the report of the firm SECOR-KPMG on the management of additional expenditure for service and construction contracts of certain public bodies.
“The words of Philippe Couillard are an illustration that the more things change, the more it is the same with the PLQ. The same laxity, the same trivialization of an organizational culture that has led to an explosion in additional costs in MTQ projects. The PLQ made the damning bulletin of its own management that this report represents, ”lamented Minister Gaudreault.
“Under the liberal regime, the additional costs have literally exploded from 68 extras in 2009 to 159 in 2012. Total of these additional costs: 309 million dollars. Despite everything, the new head of the PLQ takes everything lightly. I find Mr. Couillard&#39;s attitude appalling and irresponsible, ”said Minister Gaudreault.
“Our government is determined to take the necessary steps to restore rigor and integrity in the management of public funds. We are in action to bring about this necessary change of culture at the MTQ but also in all the public apparatus. The creation of a Transport Agency is at the heart of this process, ”concluded Mr. Gaudreault.
In March 2013, the government of Quebec mandated the firm SECOR-KPMG to shed light on the cost overruns of construction contracts and professional services of three large public bodies, namely the Ministry of Transport, the Société immobilière du Québec and the Quebec Shared Services Center.
