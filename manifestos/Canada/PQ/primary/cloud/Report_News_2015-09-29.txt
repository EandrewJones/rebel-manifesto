Quebec - The member for Rousseau and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of finance and revenue, Nicolas Marceau, asks the government not to implement the conclusions of the Godbout report, until several questions raised have been raised. not found a satisfactory answer.
“We learned yesterday that two experts, economists and university professors, questioned the conclusions of the report of the Quebec Tax Examination Commission; according to them, these conclusions are based on calculations which have not been demonstrated. These warnings are extremely serious and require that all light be shed, ”declared Nicolas Marceau.
Remember that the economists behind this warning, André Lemelin and Bernard Decaluwé, actively participated in the design and implementation of a calculation model used by the Ministry of Finance, among others to assess the impact of the reform proposed in the Godbout report in terms of job creation and GDP growth.
&quot;Now, now these two seasoned economists are questioning the minister&#39;s estimates and the relevance of the tax reform, claiming that they cannot conclude that the forecasts are reliable because in the Godbout report, several essential information is not disclosed&quot;, continued the spokesperson.
The Parti Québécois demands from the government all the transparency that the population expects of it. “The Liberal government is trying to sell Quebeckers a set of tax and tariff increases based on calculations that we know nothing about. It is unthinkable to go ahead with a reform of this magnitude without the government agreeing to disclose all the information allowing it to conclude that this reform would be advantageous for Quebecers, ”concluded Nicolas Marceau.
