Bromont– Elaine Zakaïb, Minister responsible for Industrial Policy and the Banque de développement économique du Québec, participated in the inauguration of the GE Aviation center of excellence in robotics in Bromont.
This center, which will enable the creation of new and optimized robotization techniques, will also be used to design robotic vision and inspection systems that will be used in all GE Aviation factories around the world.
&quot;This new center of excellence allows the GE Aviation plant in Bromont to maintain and strengthen its competitive position within the General Electric group and on world markets,&quot; said Élaine Zakaïb. “This large-scale project also contributes to the dynamism and economic vitality of the Montérégie region while consolidating and creating highly specialized jobs in Quebec. &quot;
The GE Aviation plant in Bromont specializes in hot and cold forging of aircraft jet compressor blades. It currently has more than 700 employees, 30 of whom already work at the robotics center. In addition, 60 other employees will join them.
“Our Bromont aviation facilities are productive and globally competitive thanks to the talent, creativity and skills of our employee teams,” said Elyse Allan, President and CEO of GE Canada. “The impressive aeronautics cluster in Quebec and the solid university programs that support it make Bromont the ideal location for our new global research and development center in robotics, automation and instrumentation. &quot;
It should be remembered that the Government of Quebec has granted financial assistance of nearly $ 8.4 million to the GE Aviation plant in Bromont for the establishment of two centers of excellence in research, including one in robotics.
