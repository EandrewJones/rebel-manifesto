The official opposition spokesperson for finance and Quebec-Canada relations, Nicolas Marceau, and the spokesperson for national identity, Pascal Bérubé, see by the appointment of the Member of Parliament for Honoré-Mercier, Pablo Rodriguez, as Minister of Canadian Heritage, the opportunity for Justin Trudeau to reverse and correct the tax inequity he previously established between the American giant Netflix and the craftsmen here.
IN SHORT
From the outset, Pascal Bérubé called on the new minister to seize the opportunity presented to him: &quot;The management of the Netflix file will have made many of our Quebec artisans precarious and will have cost many local producers and artists dearly. . The Parti Québécois was the first to sound the alarm and demand that Netflix, like all web giants, pay its taxes ”.
“The Trudeau government neglected the interests of Quebecers by signing an agreement with Neflix that does not respect tax rules and that does not ensure a threshold for French content. The federal government allows Netflix to act as a tax offender. I ask the new Minister of Canadian Heritage, Pablo Rodriguez, to review this bad agreement and to intervene quickly to restore fairness between the multinational and the broadcasters here. It is not too late to do well, ”added Nicolas Marceau.
