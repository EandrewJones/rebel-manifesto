“The regions are unfortunately once again being left behind. Even with all her good intentions, how will the member for Anjou, the new minister responsible for regional economic development, fully grasp the regional reality? Likewise, Martin Coiteux, now head of the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Land Occupancy, is a member of the metropolitan region. Is he really up to date with what is happening in the regions? », Continued the spokesperson.
It should be remembered that when they came to power, the Liberals withdrew the word “regions” from the designation of the Department of Municipal Affairs. “It sends the message that for this government, the regions, it is secondary, even worse.

Who will stand up, in the Council of Ministers, to defend the regions of Quebec and the citizens who live there? », Concluded Gaétan Lelièvre.
