Québec, October 29, 2014 - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for international relations, Carole Poirier, deplores the diplomatic setback suffered by the Premier of Quebec in China.
“Philippe Couillard has just failed miserably his first major economic mission abroad. Several experts have assessed that the Prime Minister, in trying to sell Quebec pork to the largest pork producer in the world, made a major diplomatic blunder. This testifies to a total ignorance of the file, ”declared Carole Poirier.
The lecturer at the University of Montreal, and specialist in Chinese issues, Loïc Tassé, considers that:
“Mr. Couillard has indeed lost face in China in a public exchange with the governor of the powerful province of Shandong.
He wanted to defend Quebec pork producers by asking Shandong to facilitate pork imports from Quebec. Except that China is the biggest producer of pork in the world. […]
Conclusion: Mr. Couillard is poorly surrounded, or he is poorly prepared, or both. &quot;
The MP also laments that the Prime Minister doubled his wrongs with an affront, declaring publicly that it was &quot;not surprising that the governor is not aware of the problems of routing&quot;. Shortly after, the Minister of the Economy, Jacques Daoust, added, saying that the Chinese had misunderstood what Quebec had come to offer them.
“What is even more serious than the Prime Minister&#39;s blunder is his lack of respect for the Chinese authorities. He must make amends and apologize. He goes to China to support our companies, to facilitate their entry into the Chinese market; losing face there is certainly not going to help them get there. It is the image of Quebec that is tarnished, and this, through its fault, ”concluded Carole Poirier.
