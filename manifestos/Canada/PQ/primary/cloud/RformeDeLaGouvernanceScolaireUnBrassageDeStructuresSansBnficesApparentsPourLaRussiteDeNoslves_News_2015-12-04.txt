Quebec - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of education, research and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, wonders about the real benefits on student success that the reform of school governance proposed by the liberal government. Faced with the concerns and legitimate questions raised by Bill 86, the official opposition is calling for general consultations to ensure that all the players concerned have the chance to express their views on the content of the reform.
“The Minister of Education will have to show us that this mixing of structures will bring real benefits promoting the academic success of Quebec students. At this point, the proof is far from being done. The bill also raises several serious questions and concerns. This is why the holding of general consultations seems essential to us, ”indicated Alexandre Cloutier.
In the eyes of the Parti Québécois, the establishment of a two-tier school democracy - where some citizens will have the right to vote to elect members of their school board and others, not, depending on the region - immediately raises several questions. . The same goes for the granting of a power of taxation to a school board not elected by universal suffrage, a situation which calls into question a basic democratic principle: &quot;no taxation without representation&quot;.
In addition, the scope of the new powers conferred on the Minister of Education, as well as the operation of the new resource allocation committees, will require clarification.
Finally, Alexandre Cloutier deplores the timing chosen for the tabling of the bill. “The government has deliberately decided to table a major reform on the last day of a parliamentary session to avoid having to answer questions from the opposition in the National Assembly. He tries to drown the fish in this day of assessments. This way of doing things shows a lack of respect for the democratic process, ”he concluded.
