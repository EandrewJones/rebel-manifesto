Quebec - In the case of the reform of pre-hospital emergency services, Diane Lamarre, Member of Parliament for Taillon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of health and access to care, wonders about the intentions of the Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette; it calls for a plan in full transparency, out of respect for patients and employees of the ambulance sector.
“The Ouellet report, commissioned by the Parti Québécois, was submitted to the Minister of Health in June 2014. It was entitled Prehospital services: Urgence to act. The message could not be clearer. However, the minister took several months before appointing, in February 2015, a committee to implement the recommendations. The report highlighted serious shortcomings, in particular the absence of a culture of performance and accountability, despite the hundreds of millions of public money that are invested to provide pre-hospital emergency services, ”said Diane. Lamarre.
“During the study of the budgetary appropriations, last April, we learned that this implementation committee has not met since June 3, 2015. At the same time, the Minister announced an overhaul of the service contract in the ambulance sector. What are these decisions and choices based on? Certain aspects, in light of the Ouellet report, certainly appear relevant to us, but the Minister&#39;s lack of a plan prevents us from understanding his overall vision and some of his decisions, in particular the government&#39;s withdrawal from negotiations with the paramedics. We wonder about the minister&#39;s intentions; he should be transparent and clearly explain his plan to us, ”the spokesperson continued.
“The paramedics are also puzzled; they do not know where the minister is going and would like to meet with him on this subject, but their request went unanswered. Will he agree to meet the paramedics? Will he tell us about his plan and be transparent? », Concluded the member.
