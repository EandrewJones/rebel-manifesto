Québec, March 10, 2021 - Pascal Bérubé, the member for Matane-Matapédia, parliamentary leader and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on the reform of democratic institutions, is impatient for the detailed study of Bill 39 to begin, Law establishing a new voting system. &quot;If the government does not move immediately, it will be too late for the next general election,&quot; he warned.
IN SHORT
The Parti Québécois urges the government to call as quickly as possible for the detailed study of Bill 39, on the reform of the voting system.The new political and parliamentary reality in Quebec makes it necessary that we thoroughly rethink our method of voting. Carrying out this reform before the next general election was an electoral promise of the CAQ.
Like the Mouvement Démocratie Nouvelle (MDN), the Parti Québécois urges the CAQ government to really launch the reform of the voting system, as it had promised. “We have waited long enough. The CAQ must honor its commitment and offer Quebecers a new voting system, regional mixed proportional, which will better reflect the will of the population. In Parliament, the new multi-party reality requires it, ”first argued the parliamentary leader.
Pascal Bérubé recalls that it was François Legault himself who established the roadmap in 2018. “The candidate for the post of Prime Minister had given his word: elected, he was going to carry out this long-awaited reform. Let him move now; everyone is ready, ”he said.
Remember that recently, the Chief Electoral Officer warned that if we did not move forward soon, time would run out and the reform would not be in effect during the next general election. “Not acting is the equivalent of encouraging cynicism. Does François Legault want to pass for the one who shies away? I don&#39;t think so, ”concluded Pascal Bérubé.
