Quebec - Reacting to the Couillard government&#39;s proposal regarding the process for appointing senators, Stéphane Bergeron, Member of Parliament for Verchères and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on Quebec-Canada relations, is sorry to note that the Liberals are still seeking to reform the Canadian Senate rather than simply calling for its abolition.
“Once again, Philippe Couillard is missing an opportunity to get in tune with Quebecers and demand the abolition of the Senate. The Liberal Party is determined to keep this moribund and undemocratic institution. We pay close to 100 million a year for this &quot;upper house&quot; which is essentially useless. Even if the Liberal proposal were accepted, the Canadian Prime Minister would still retain the last word on appointments, despite the fact that the Senate should, in theory, fulfill the function of &quot;Chamber of Regions&quot;. We are far from a great democratic renewal, ”said Stéphane Bergeron indignantly.
What is more, while the premiers of Canada and Quebec are having fun looking for ways to reform the Senate, many issues remain unresolved between Quebec and Canada. “Instead of throwing the ball around and drafting proposals about the Senate, Philippe Couillard and Justin Trudeau should be busy settling important disputes that are costing Quebecers dearly. The Liberal Party of Quebec could tackle, for example, the clearly insufficient indexation of health transfers, the unjust ceilings imposed on equalization, or the unfair treatment of Hydro-Quebec dividends in the calculation of the share of the Quebec, rather than proposing naively optimistic reforms that in no way improve the situation in Quebec, ”concluded the member for Verchères.
