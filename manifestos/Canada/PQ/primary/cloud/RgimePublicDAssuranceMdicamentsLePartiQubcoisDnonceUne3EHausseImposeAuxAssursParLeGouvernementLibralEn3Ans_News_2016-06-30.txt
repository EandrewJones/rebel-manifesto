Quebec– Diane Lamarre, Member of Parliament for Taillon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of health and access to care, denounces the imposition of a third rate hike in three years for those insured under the public drug insurance plan .
“While the Prime Minister had made a commitment not to increase the tax burden on Quebecers and not to increase any tariff beyond inflation, the RAMQ announced that, as of July 1, the annual premium for policyholders will rise from $ 640 to $ 660 per year, an increase of 3.1%. However, during the study of the budget appropriations in April, the documents provided by the Minister of Health indicated a forecast of only 0.6% increase in the cost of drugs for the year 2015-2016. Why, therefore, increase so much the contribution of the insured? », Asked Diane Lamarre.
“We are talking about an increase approaching three times the inflation rate, which was 1.1% in 2015. We are very far from Philippe Couillard&#39;s promise, and this position is indefensible. How can the Minister of Health justify this umpteenth increase that he is passing on to patients? », Continued the spokesperson.
“Some 3.5 million Quebecers will have to absorb this increase, in particular that of the monthly deductible, which will go from $ 18 to $ 18.85 per month. Since the arrival of this Liberal government, rates have continued to increase; that&#39;s enough! », Concluded Diane Lamarre.
