Montreal - As flip-flops have become a trademark at the CAQ, François Legault made another turnaround yesterday on the issue of pension plans for municipal employees. The CAQ leader announced to Quebecers that he was renouncing his platform and that he would not wait for the D&#39;Amours committee report before imposing a solution.
“The lack of rigor that characterizes the CAQ is worrying. François Legault is irresponsible when it comes to municipal employee pension plans. He promised to create a committee when one already exists, and there he promises to impose a solution before even hearing the recommendations of this committee! What a lack of respect for the representatives of the municipalities and the employees who were consulted by this committee, not to mention the committee&#39;s experts, ”declared the Parti Québécois candidate in the riding of Blainville, Bernard Généreux.
The Parti Québécois candidate in the Rousseau constituency, Nicolas Marceau, deplores the dangerous amateurism of François Legault in this case. “François Legault never stops contradicting himself. In its platform, the CAQ proposes &quot;a committee of experts [which] will also be set up to propose sustainable solutions to the management of the pension plans of municipal employees&quot;. However, such a committee has already existed for several months! This committee is chaired by Alban D&#39;Amours and is made up of recognized experts. We have to believe that François Legault had forgotten the existence of the committee when drafting his platform! &quot;
For the Parti Québécois, there is no question of playing matamore with workers&#39; pensions. “At the Parti Québécois, we trust the experts of the D&#39;Amours committee and we will be guided by their recommendations to resolve this problem as soon as possible. We will be responsible and we will act in the interests of Quebecers, ”Nicolas Marceau concluded.
