Montreal - Réjean Hébert, Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Seniors, and Jean-François Lisée, Minister of International Relations, La Francophonie and Foreign Trade and Minister responsible for the Montreal region and Member of Parliament for Rosemont , announce additional budgets of $ 15,803,800 to improve home care and services for seniors in the region.
“Improving services for seniors with loss of autonomy is one of our government&#39;s top priorities, as will also be confirmed by our approach to autonomy insurance, which will be unveiled shortly. Immediate improvement in home support will make it possible to serve more seniors, to help those who already receive services even more judiciously and to better support families, ”said Minister Hébert.
These new credits have three components:
“Community organizations working with the elderly are valuable partners for the network, particularly for home care. These additional credits will allow them to improve their service offering to this clientele, ”stated Véronique Hivon, Minister for Social Services and Youth Protection, responsible for community organizations.
“The Montreal region is the one that receives the largest amounts from the envelope newly allocated by our government in the field of home care and services. We thus provide tangible support to institutions, community organizations and social economy enterprises that help seniors with loss of autonomy, ”commented the Minister responsible for the Montreal region, Jean-François Lisée. .
