Québec, October 24, 2017 –The official opposition spokesperson for forests, wildlife and parks, Sylvain Roy, as well as the spokesperson for transport and municipal affairs, Martin Ouellet, ask the Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, Luc Blanchette, to renew the agreements so that snowmobile clubs retain exclusive access to forest roads.
IN SHORT
“The snowmobile industry represents more than $ 3.27 billion in spinoffs and 14,000 jobs in the regions of Quebec. However, the new mode of governance of multi-use roads puts the entire sector in peril. Indeed, if we take away from the snowmobile clubs the exclusive access to forest roads and if we forbid them to sell membership cards on different portions of their circuit, as the Minister intends, survival some will inevitably be compromised, ”Sylvain Roy immediately declared.
“Everything worked smoothly when the file was piloted by the Ministry of Natural Resources; the agreements fully met the needs of clubs, snowmobilers, the population and vacationers. But since this responsibility was handed over to the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, everything has gone awry. In my riding, in Baie-Comeau, as well as in Chapais, among others, clubs are threatened with closure; the minister must stop being so intransigent and act before the snowmobile season begins, ”Martin Ouellet insisted.
It is even a question of safety: for snowmobile clubs, the sale of membership cards is essential to finance the operations of surfacing and trail signage, among other things. The players in this important industry expect a clear commitment from the Minister: the agreements concerning the exclusivity of the right of way on public lands must be renewed, and quickly. At the very least, Luc Blanchette must agree to meet the representatives of the Federation of snowmobile clubs! ”Sylvain Roy concluded.
