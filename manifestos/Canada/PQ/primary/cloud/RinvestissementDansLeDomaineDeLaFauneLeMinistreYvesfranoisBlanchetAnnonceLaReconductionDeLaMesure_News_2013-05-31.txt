Quebec - The Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet, announces the maintenance of the Reinvestment in the field of wildlife in its current form, for a fifth consecutive year.
&quot;I am pleased to announce the renewal of the Reinvestment measure in the field of wildlife which, after four years and more than $ 15 million invested, has made it possible to carry out more than 450 projects in Quebec,&quot; said the Minister. .
Reinvestment in the field of wildlife has become one of the main intervention and partnership tools for the wildlife sector of the Ministère du Développement durable, de l&#39;Environnement, de la Faune et des Parcs. Over the years, it has adapted both to the needs of wildlife federations and to those of local organizations.
In 2009, an increase in the prices of hunting, fishing and trapping licenses, agreed with the main wildlife partners, made it possible to create the Reinvestment in the field of wildlife (RDF). Through this budgetary measure, the government is investing approximately $ 4 million every year in projects to develop activities concerning exploited wildlife species. The current permit sales trends allow us to estimate RDF revenues at $ 4.5 million for 2013-2014.
&quot;With this sum, the Ministère du Développement durable, de l&#39;Environnement, de la Faune et des Parcs and its wildlife partners will be able to implement even more projects that will help consolidate the sustainable use of wildlife,&quot; added the Minister. Blanchet.
