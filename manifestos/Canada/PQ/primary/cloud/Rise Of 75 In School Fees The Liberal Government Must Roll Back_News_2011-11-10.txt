Quebec - While a major demonstration will be held today in Montreal against the hike in tuition fees and in which several members of the Parti Québécois will participate, the member for Taillon and official opposition critic for higher education and loans and bursaries, Marie Malavoy, and the member for Terrebonne and official opposition spokesperson for youth and student affairs, Mathieu Traversy, demand that the Liberal government stop insisting on going forward with its abusive hike in tuition fees.
The Parti Québécois has called for the adoption of a motion in the National Assembly stating:
That the National Assembly demand that the Liberal government renounce the increase in tuition fees announced for fall 2012; that it freeze tuition fees until a summit on higher education is held and the adoption of a framework law on tuition fees and other related costs which will aim to reduce student debt , which will take into account the ability to pay of students and which will preserve affordability and regional accessibility.
However, the Liberal members as well as the CAQ-ADQ members voted against this motion. “While the Liberal government is withdrawing from funding universities, it is increasing fees by 75% in five years, asking students to assume 43 years of inflation in five years. It is totally unfair. This increase will hamper accessibility to higher education and discourage many students, in addition to placing a burden on middle-class parents. Education is the backbone of Quebec&#39;s development, but the government is taking action to restrict accessibility. He must listen to reason, he must step back, ”concluded the deputies.
