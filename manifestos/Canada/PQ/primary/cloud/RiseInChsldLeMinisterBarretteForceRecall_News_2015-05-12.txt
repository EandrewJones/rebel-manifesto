Québec– The member for Richelieu and official opposition spokesperson for seniors, Sylvain Rochon, and the member for Taillon and spokesperson for health and access to care, Diane Lamarre, note that Minister Gaétan Barrette was forced to back down on the rate increase, higher than inflation, which he wanted to impose on residents in CHSLDs, many of whom are seniors. They also undertake to remain vigilant with regard to the modulation announced by the Minister.
“Minister Barrette finally listened to reason, after all the questions we asked him on this subject during the consideration of supply and during question period. Let us recall that the Prime Minister himself promised, during the election campaign last year, that the tariffs would not increase beyond inflation, ”declared Sylvain Rochon.
The deputy adds that people accommodated in CHSLDs need quality care; however, it seems that at present, this care is given in a very uneven way from one establishment to another. “Dark baths, showers every two years, 3,752 Quebeckers on the waiting list, inadequate intervention plans… the list goes on! Can we now focus on the care we give to patients instead of concocting rate hikes? He asked.
Diane Lamarre recalls for her part that it was the questions of the official opposition to the Minister of Health that made it possible to find this increase in fees for seniors. “The increase in CHSLD rates beyond inflation was hidden among the 1,200 pages of documents sent to parliamentarians. The minister initially described it as a shell, which obviously was not the case. Does he still want to get $ 10.4 million by changing the way residents calculate the contribution? We will remain vigilant for the rest of things and, today, we are asking the Minister to devote his energies to improving the care and services offered to our seniors and to severely disabled people residing in CHSLDs ”, she concluded. .
