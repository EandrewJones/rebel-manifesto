Quebec - The member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition critic for elementary and secondary education and school perseverance, Nicole Léger, unreservedly denounces the Liberal government&#39;s desire to no longer distinguish between children in difficulty and others to calculate the teacher-student ratio. In this regard, he absolutely has to go back. She also asks the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport to publicly explain to teachers what her government wants to do, instead of remaining silent.
“The Liberal government has totally lost touch with reality. Does he really believe that this measure will not affect the quality of teaching in elementary and secondary schools in Quebec? Does he believe that increasing the teacher-student ratio in disadvantaged areas will have no effect on academic success? What planet does the Liberal government live on? », Indignant Nicole Léger.
“It&#39;s a slap in the face for parents of troubled children. The Quebec government is letting them down, they who fight day after day to ensure that their children integrate as well as possible into the school system. Teachers will now have less time to devote to them, ”added the spokesperson.
Nicole Léger believes that ultimately all children in Quebec will suffer the repercussions of this thoughtless measure. “It is obvious that this decision does not take into account the quality of education and the well-being of young people. It was taken for financial reasons, period, ”she concluded.
