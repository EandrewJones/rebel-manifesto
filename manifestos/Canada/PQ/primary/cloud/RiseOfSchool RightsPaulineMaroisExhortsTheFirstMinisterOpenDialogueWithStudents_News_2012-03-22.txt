Quebec - The Leader of the Official Opposition and Member of Parliament for Charlevoix, Pauline Marois, urges the Premier to act responsibly and to open a dialogue with students. “The Liberal government&#39;s stubborn attitude towards students has gone on long enough. Real leadership is about getting results. The Prime Minister&#39;s attitude has produced the opposite effect. There are now more than 200,000 Quebec students who are on strike. The activities of our CEGEPs and universities are paralyzed. The demonstrations are increasing, the conflict is escalating, ”she said.
The 75% tuition hike hits middle-class families head on, who will have to pay up to $ 3,800 per year per child in college, in addition to related fees and living expenses. For a family with two, three or four children, access to higher education may be compromised.
“You should know that the vast majority of young people from middle-class families are not entitled to scholarships. It is legitimate for a government to make the decision to increase tariffs, but there are limits, 75%, that just doesn&#39;t make sense. Student leaders have reached out to the government on several occasions. I therefore invite the Prime Minister to show real leadership, to assume his responsibilities and to open a dialogue with the students, ”added Pauline Marois.
“True leadership is exercised not by being rigid and deaf like Jean Charest, but by accepting a dialogue with students in order to find solutions and obtain results,” she said.
“If the Liberals persist to the end and impose this increase, a Parti Québécois government will cancel it. If Quebecers trust us to form the next government, we will hold a summit on higher education. We will then bring together all the players and we will establish a funding method acceptable to all parties, ”concluded the leader of the official opposition.
