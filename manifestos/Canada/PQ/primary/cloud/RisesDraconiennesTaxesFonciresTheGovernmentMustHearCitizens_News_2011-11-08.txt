Quebec - The member for Berthier and official opposition spokesperson for regional development and land use, André Villeneuve, demands that the government stop turning a deaf ear to citizens who are facing drastic increases in property taxes.
“For eight years, Quebec citizens have suffered constant increases in property taxes. In 2008, the Parti Québécois tabled a bill to resolve this problem. Unfortunately, the government never called him. Then, in 2010, we passed a motion in the National Assembly ordering the government to table a bill and to consult those affected by this problem. The government tabled a bill last March, but nothing has happened since. This government does not even bother to call its own bill! However, people who are victims of property tax increases have things to say and need solutions to be found, ”said André Villeneuve.
The Parti Québécois demands that the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Laurent Lessard, keep his word and listen to citizens as part of public consultations on property tax increases. “The Minister replies that he is offering us his collaboration so that we can find a better solution together. It is time for him to walk the talk, stop shirking his responsibilities and listen to the citizens and all the players concerned, ”concluded the deputy.
