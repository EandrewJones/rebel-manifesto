Quebec - In reaction to an article published this morning, concerning the double remuneration of a vice-rector of Laval University, the member for Joliette and official opposition spokesperson for higher education, Véronique Hivon, asks the Minister of Education, Higher Education and Research, François Blais, to act in order to regulate the conditions of remuneration of senior executives of Quebec universities.
“This morning&#39;s article confirms the need for action. In the matter of improving the post-term conditions of senior leaders at Laval University, moreover, the impasse has been going on for more than nine months. Enough is enough. The Minister of Higher Education must quickly table a bill to regulate the remuneration and post-mandate conditions of senior executives of Quebec universities, ”declared Véronique Hivon.
Remember that the government of Pauline Marois had tightened regulations in this area, ensuring that any change in the salary or working conditions of senior university leaders had to be approved by the government.
“We had sent a strong signal, but obviously not everyone understood it. However, we must take the next step. We ask Minister Blais to present a bill on this subject as soon as Parliament returns, ”concluded the MP.
