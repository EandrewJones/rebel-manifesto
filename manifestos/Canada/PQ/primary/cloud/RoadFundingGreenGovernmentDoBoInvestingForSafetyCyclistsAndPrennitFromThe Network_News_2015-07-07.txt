Québec - The MP for Vachon and official opposition spokesperson for transport, Martine Ouellet, and the MP for Labelle and spokesperson for recreation and sports, Sylvain Pagé, support Vélo Québec&#39;s recommendations for maintaining the Route verte.
“The abolition of the Route verte maintenance program by the Liberals last November is endangering the engines of tourism development that have become essential in several regions of Quebec. Vélo Québec today published a series of recommendations in an attempt to save this internationally recognized Quebec gem. The government must act on it as quickly as possible, ”said Martine Ouellet.
&quot;With this decision, the Liberals are turning their backs on more than 20 years of efforts by the regions, civil society, municipalities and the government of Quebec to develop a more than profitable cycling network for the communities hosting thousands of cyclists each year. In the name of austerity, this government is taking decisions without vision and ignoring the many positive effects of this network, in particular on safety, good lifestyles and regional tourism development, ”declared Sylvain Pagé.
Safety of cyclists must be a priority As the holidays approach, it is unfortunate that bicycle accidents are still making headlines. On the eve of an overhaul of the Highway Safety Code, Transport Minister Robert Poëti must put cyclist safety at the center of his priorities.
“The safety of cyclists requires not only the maintenance of the Route verte, but also a major overhaul of the Highway Safety Code. The Parti Québécois supports the establishment of a mandatory one-meter buffer zone between motorists and cyclists, as proposed by Vélo Québec. We will closely monitor the changes to the Code so that the safety of cyclists is essential, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
