Montreal - The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, is pleased to announce the candidacy of Robert Carrier in the riding of Mille-Îles. “Robert Carrier is an experienced politician who defended the interests of Quebec for many years in Ottawa. His knowledge of federal politics will be of great use to us. This is another quality candidacy for the people of Laval, ”said Pauline Marois.
A civil engineer by training, Robert Carrier was a member of the Bloc Québécois in the riding of Alfred-Pellan from 2004 to 2011. He was notably the revenue critic from 2008 to 2011.
“My experience in Ottawa convinced me that Quebec has nothing more to hope for from federalism. Only the Parti Québécois has the will and the capacity to stand up to re-establish a balance of power with the federal government. We need a government strictly dedicated to the interests of Quebec and a woman like Pauline Marois to lead it. I am proud to stand by his side, ”said Robert Carrier.
Pauline Marois said she was excited about the team presented by the Parti Québécois and believes that Quebecers will be too. “We have a great team, women and men from all walks of life who want to contribute to the advancement of Quebec. We have ideas and a program that will rally the population and we have the most beautiful social projects. This campaign is the perfect opportunity for Quebec to get back on track. &quot;
Remember that the Parti Québécois is the largest political formation in Quebec with its 90,000 members.
