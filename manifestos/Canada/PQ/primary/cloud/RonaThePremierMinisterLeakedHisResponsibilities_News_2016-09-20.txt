Quebec City, September 20, 2016 - Jonquière MP and leader of the official opposition, Sylvain Gaudreault, denounced the total indifference of Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, who continues to shirk his responsibilities and refuses to shed light on the issue Rona.
“Even if the government is the sole shareholder and it appoints all the directors of Investissement Québec itself, the Prime Minister has taken refuge behind procedures in order not to know anything about the situation and not answer for the decisions that arise. took under his nose, at Investissement Quebec, concerning the future of Rona. Necessarily, either the Prime Minister or his chief of staff made a mistake. But who? We need to know that. For us, it is clear: Jean-Louis Dufresne, Jacques Daoust and Raymond Bachand must appear before a parliamentary committee so that all the light is shed on the Rona file ”, declared Sylvain Gaudreault first.
The member for Jonquière recalls that in parliamentary committee, the former chief of staff of Jacques Daoust, Pierre Ouellet, affirmed that he had discussed the Rona file with the chief of staff of the Prime Minister, on June 2, 2016 precisely. However, the Prime Minister subsequently affirmed on at least two occasions in the House that he had no reason to question the word of his minister.
“Either the Prime Minister did not set the record straight for parliamentarians and Quebeckers when he made these statements, or we are playing in the same film as during the scandal at the MTQ. Soon the Prime Minister will tell us, on another file of the utmost importance, that his chief of staff has not informed him either. The Prime Minister must immediately come out of his indifference and assume his responsibilities, ”concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
