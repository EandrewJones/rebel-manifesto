Quebec - While Premier Jean Charest said last May to journalist Alexandre Shields from Le Devoir that he was &quot;ready to debate&quot; the issue of mining royalties and that the fall would certainly be a good time to do so, he said. says exactly the opposite right now on the sidelines of his trip to Asia.
“It is absurd that the Prime Minister is going back on his word like this. Bill 14 is the perfect opportunity to establish a royalty regime that will ensure that Quebecers get richer and instead, Jean Charest prefers to do nothing, ”lamented the spokesperson for the official opposition in mining and MP for Vachon, Martine Ouellet.
“Why is the Prime Minister going back on his word? Is it in order to appease Chinese investors by letting them glimpse practically free natural resources? “, Asked the member.
The Parti Québécois proposes to seek the maximum amount of mining royalties by setting up a compulsory royalty on gross revenues, without tax deduction, while establishing a fair sharing of the surplus profit, as the Australians do. In addition, the Parti Québécois is proposing to take strategic stakes in mining companies, as Newfoundland and Norway are already doing for oil.
“Nothing has been resolved since the tabling of the Auditor General&#39;s devastating report. Of the four billion in gross revenues generated by the Quebec mining industry in 2009-2010, the Quebec government only collected 23 million in net rights. Almost half of Quebec mining companies (7 out of 18) pay absolutely no royalties because they make no profit after applying all the tax deductions. 12% of zero dollars equals zero dollars. Even if the government increases this percentage to 16%, it will still be zero dollars! It is unacceptable! Things have to change and quickly! We do not have the means to deprive ourselves of this income any longer, whatever Jean Charest thinks, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
