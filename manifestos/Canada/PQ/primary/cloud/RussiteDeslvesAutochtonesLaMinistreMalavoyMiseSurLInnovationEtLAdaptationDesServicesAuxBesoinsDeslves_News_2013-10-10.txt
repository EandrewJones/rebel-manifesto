Quebec - The Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports, Ms. Marie Malavoy, and the Minister for Indigenous Peoples, Ms. Élizabeth Larouche, today announced the allocation of $ 75,000 in financial assistance to the Center des Nakanite First Nations for the organization of a conference on practices and learning styles adapted to Aboriginal youth and on teaching strategies to be implemented for greater effectiveness.
“Young Aboriginals live a unique reality that reflects their culture and identity. It is important that they receive educational services that meet their needs and allow them to develop their immense potential. They will thus be able to make an optimal contribution to the development of their communities. This conference will provide an opportunity for Indigenous and non-Indigenous school staff, researchers and students to share best practices and innovative ideas in Indigenous education. This is a decisive step in the right direction, ”said Minister Malavoy.
The conference will take place in Saguenay on March 4, 5 and 6, 2014. The University of Quebec at Chicoutimi, to which the Center is attached, will provide, free of charge, the necessary spaces, meeting rooms, amphitheater and other premises necessary for the holding of the event.
“In terms of development, one of the greatest assets of indigenous communities are their young people with immense potential, a potential that must be activated and brought to maturity, while respecting their specificity. The conference will ensure that the expertise developed will be shared, pooled and that a growing number of young Aboriginals can benefit from it. This bodes well for the future, ”said Minister Larouche.
