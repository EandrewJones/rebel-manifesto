Montreal - The Parti Québécois is launching its second Web advertisement and invites voters to make the choice to get rich by supporting the Parti Québécois program, in particular for the responsible development of our natural resources.
The Parti Québécois plan is based on six axes:
Thus, a Parti Québécois government will increase royalties on natural resources by setting a minimum royalty based on gross income, as is done in many countries. We are also going to introduce a tax on the surplus profits of mining companies to ensure a more equitable sharing of our collective wealth.
A Parti Québécois government intends to ensure that the State takes a stake in the ownership of certain strategic projects and also intends to ensure that our resources are transformed as much as possible in Quebec.
“Quebec is full of exceptional natural resources. To obtain the best benefits and enrich Quebecers, we must refuse to be dispossessed of our natural resources and quickly regain control. It is the majority who should benefit from it, not a minority. It must be done with respect for the environment and the communities. It is possible and such is the plan of the Parti Québécois, ”declared the leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois.
