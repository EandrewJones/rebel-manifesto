Montreal - The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, undertakes to set up a tax credit to encourage the practice of sports activities among young people. “A real public health policy must contain preventive measures, and the practice of physical activities clearly contributes to having better health. To encourage young people to play sports, a Parti Québécois government will provide parents with the means to register their children for sports activities in an association, a federation or a club, ”she explained.
The Parti Québécois is committed to offering a refundable tax credit of $ 500 per child aged 5 to 16, for any registration in sports activities for families with a family income of less than $ 130,000. This measure will affect a little over 300,000 young people. It will cost $ 25 million which will be drawn from the specific tax fund on tobacco products.
We will also implement a program to increase sports activities in public schools.
“According to statistics, one in three families cannot afford to enroll their children in sports. However, a young person who practices a sport he loves is more likely to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The more active and fit young people are, the more they will have a good quality of life and good health. In addition, this inexpensive measure will make it possible in a few years to make substantial savings in the health sector. », Concluded Pauline Marois.
