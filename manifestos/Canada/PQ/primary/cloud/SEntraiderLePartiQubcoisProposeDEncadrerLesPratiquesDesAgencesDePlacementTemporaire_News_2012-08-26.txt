Montreal - The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, is committed to better supervising temporary employment agencies that offer personnel services in all areas of employment. “This is an industry that is booming in Quebec. The people who work for these agencies are often vulnerable and have little knowledge of the laws and regulations governing work in Quebec. Certain agency practices are sometimes questionable. It is high time to supervise them adequately, ”explained Pauline Marois.
A Parti Québécois government will pass a law that will introduce three specific measures to regulate the practices of these employment agencies. First, obtaining an operating permit will be made compulsory, an information form on employment conditions will also be compulsory, and finally, a principle of co-responsibility between agencies and client companies will be established.
The situation of workers in employment agencies is special. On the one hand, there is the agency which hires staff and pays them. On the other hand, there is the client of the agency who supervises the worker and directs him on a daily basis. The person hired is paid by the agency, but they work for their client. Being stuck between two companies places the agency employee in a difficult situation with regard to labor rights. In theory, the same rights should apply, but in practice the application of these rights is often more difficult.
“We want to better supervise the practices of these agencies to protect the rights of workers. Some do not know their schedule, their salary or even the name of the company that hires them. These practices must stop. The worker is often the big loser in the relationship between the agency and the employer. We notice that the employer tends to take no responsibility for this employee, treated as if he were second-rate. We will give workers their rightful place. We have a moral duty to ensure that they are treated with dignity and respect, ”concluded Pauline Marois.
