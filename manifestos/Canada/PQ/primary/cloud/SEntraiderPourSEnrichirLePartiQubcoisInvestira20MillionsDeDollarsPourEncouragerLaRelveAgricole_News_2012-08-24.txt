La Pocatière - The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, is committed to supporting the agricultural community by investing more in the next generation. “I am making a commitment to improve farm succession programs. The Parti Québécois will invest an additional $ 20 million per year to give our young farmers the necessary boost so that they can prosper in this vital sector for our economy and for Quebec as a whole, ”said Pauline Marois.
“After a long career, many farmers wish to leave their land to their children. Unfortunately, this is not possible for everyone. Of the some 800 farms sold each year in Quebec, 10 to 12% end up in the hands of a new, unrelated owner. We will help young producers to take over. La Financière agricole will have the mandate to develop new solutions to support the next generation of farmers, ”she explained.
This measure to support the next generation of farmers is in addition to those already announced by Pauline Marois to promote the development of Quebec agriculture.
“Our farmers and their products are an incredible source of pride for Quebecers. The food sovereignty policy is a key element of our agricultural policy. The objective is to reduce the proportion of Quebec foods consumed in Quebec from 33% to 50%. Thanks to a fund dedicated to the innovation, processing and distribution of Quebec products and thanks to increased support for Quebec controlled appellations, it will be possible to better support the agricultural community. Developing our agriculture, promoting this vital sector and encouraging the next generation, this is what the Parti Québécois intends to do from September 5 if it is brought to power, ”concluded Pauline Marois.
