Quebec - The Minister of Labor, Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Ms. Agnès Maltais, announces the appointment of Mr. Julien Perron as conciliator in the negotiations between the Corporation des concessionaires d automobiles Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean-Chibougamau and the Democratic Union of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean Garage Employees (CSD).
“I believe that the time has come, after eleven months of conflict, to bring about a rapprochement between the parties. In a region like Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, a conflict affecting hundreds of workers and paralyzing an entire commercial sector is not without consequences. I ask employers and union members to seize the pole held out to them and resume negotiations in the presence of the conciliator, ”said the Minister of Labor.
Since the beginning of the conflict, last March, the Ministry of Labor has contacted the parties to offer them recourse to conciliation, but no request to this effect has been addressed to it. The Minister&#39;s intervention derives from the powers conferred on her by Article 55 of the Labor Code: “At any stage of the negotiations, the Minister may, ex officio, appoint a conciliator; he must then inform the parties of this appointment ”.
Remember that the conflict affects 27 car dealers in the region. The collective agreements of some 430 employees expired on February 18, 2013. In most cases, union members have been locked out since March 5.
“The conciliator is ready to get to work. I invite union and employer representatives to work with him and to negotiate in good faith to find a compromise. Only negotiation can resolve the impasse and only the parties have the key to the solution, ”concluded Minister Maltais.
