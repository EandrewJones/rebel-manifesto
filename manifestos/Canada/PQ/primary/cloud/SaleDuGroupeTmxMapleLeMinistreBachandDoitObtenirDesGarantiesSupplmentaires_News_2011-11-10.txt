Quebec - François Rebello, the member for La Prairie and official opposition critic for financial institutions and entrepreneurship, calls on the Minister of Finance, Raymond Bachand, to obtain additional guarantees to ensure the maintenance and the development of financial sector activities in Montreal as part of the sale of TMX Group to Maple Group.
“We are in favor of this transaction whereby the Maple group, made up of several Quebec flagships, acquires the Montreal Stock Exchange. We must also ensure that the group intends to maintain and even develop the activities of the financial sector in Montreal, ”said the Member for La Prairie.
The Parti Québécois believes that Quebec has every interest in retaining a strong group of local institutional owners to develop the derivatives market in Montreal. “Minister Bachand made a 180 degree turn, he who had unreservedly supported the purchase of the Montreal Stock Exchange by the London Stock Exchange. So much the better, but he must now obtain more comprehensive guarantees, ”added François Rebello.
