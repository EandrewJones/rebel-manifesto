Quebec - The Parti Québécois has taken many steps to shed light on allegations of corruption and collusion in the construction industry and to restore integrity in the public contract award process. The PQ defended this principle before, during and after the elections.
In the opposition, despite the Liberal government&#39;s stubborn refusal to create a commission of inquiry, the Parti Québécois has never let go. We have followed the Liberal government day after day for two years by asking hundreds of questions, proposing a dozen motions, tabling petitions, mobilizing the population and increasing public interventions. In October 2009, the Prime Minister, then leader of the opposition, reiterated before the highest authorities of the FTQ the need to hold a commission of inquiry with a broad mandate.
“If pressure had been exerted on the PQ to prevent us from calling for a commission of inquiry into the construction, it would have hit a wall. A wall of integrity, ”said the Leader of the Government and Member of Parliament for Chicoutimi, Stéphane Bédard.
In government, the PQ continued its fight against corruption, in particular by extending the mandate of the commission of inquiry, cleaning up the funding of political parties and adopting the most restrictive laws on ethics.
“It is certainly no coincidence that Quebec has adopted the most severe measures in the fight against collusion and corruption. Without constant pressure from the PQ on the Liberal government, there would never have been an investigation. Once in power, we cleaned up. We are taking the necessary steps to restore public confidence in its institutions. Our will is unwavering, ”concluded Stéphane Bédard.
