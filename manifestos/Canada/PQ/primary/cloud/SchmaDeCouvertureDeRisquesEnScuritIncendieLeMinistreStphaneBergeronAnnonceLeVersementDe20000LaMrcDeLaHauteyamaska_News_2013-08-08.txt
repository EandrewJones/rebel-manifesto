Quebec - The Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, is pleased to announce that the MRC de La Haute-Yamaska has obtained its certificate of compliance for its fire safety risk coverage plan. The Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports and Minister responsible for the Montérégie region, Ms. Marie Malavoy, welcomed this announcement.
This certificate is accompanied by a grant of $ 20,000 paid to the MRC in accordance with the Financial Assistance Program for MRCs and other regional authorities for the establishment and implementation of risk coverage plans.
“I am pleased to announce that the MRC de La Haute-Yamaska has successfully completed the development of its fire safety risk coverage plan. This important regional planning exercise will allow the MRC to increase the response efficiency of the fire safety services present on its territory and, by the same token, significantly reduce losses attributable to fires, ”Minister Bergeron underlined. .
The risk coverage plans aim to increase knowledge of the fire risks present in a territory. Thus, they not only make it possible to improve services to citizens while optimizing resources, but also to provide more effective coverage of the territories in the event of fire and to facilitate the work of community workers. It is therefore an essential action for the 103 regional authorities and for the municipalities of Quebec.
For her part, the Minister wished to highlight the work of the MRC. &quot;I am proud of the work accomplished by the MRC de La Haute-Yamaska, since the fire safety risk coverage plan will allow it to offer more effective protection to its citizens,&quot; said Ms. Malavoy.
The development of risk coverage plans is the most important step in setting up the new conditions that should improve Québec&#39;s record in terms of human and material losses due to the fire.
