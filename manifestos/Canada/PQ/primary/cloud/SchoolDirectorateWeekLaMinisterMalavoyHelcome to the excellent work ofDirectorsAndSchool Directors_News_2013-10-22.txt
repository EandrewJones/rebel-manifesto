Quebec - The Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports, Ms. Marie Malavoy, took advantage of School Directors&#39; Week to recall the key role played by Quebec principals in the development and educational success of young people.
“Through their leadership and their know-how, principals of educational establishments accomplish an essential task, which is to ensure that schools allow our students to develop their full potential and succeed in their schooling. Running a school is not always easy and requires a lot of determination. In this week dedicated to them, I would like to thank them for their excellent work and to express our gratitude to them, ”said Minister Malavoy.
School Directors&#39; Week was created in 2011 on the initiative of the Montreal Association of School Directors (AMDES) and the Association québécoise du personnel de direction des écoles (AQPDE). It aims to have school administrators recognized and valued. The Week is being held again this year under the theme If you only knew what management does for education.
