Quebec - The Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet, denounces the attitude of the opposition parties who refused yesterday, in the National Assembly, to adopt the principle of Bill 37 aimed at establishing a moratorium on certain activities related to the exploration for or the exploitation of natural gas in the shale of the St.Lawrence Lowlands.
“I have been living with the issue of shale gas in my own riding on a daily basis for years. I feel the fear of the people, the outrage at the way the industry and the Liberal government have treated them, and I am concerned about a serious lack of trust in institutions. I am committed to protecting the people and I will not give up. The CAQ and the PLQ will be solely responsible for this refusal of the moratorium, and for a rekindled temptation among gas companies to consider a return to the field, to our lands, ”declared Minister Blanchet.
Tabled in the National Assembly on May 15, Bill 37 was to pass an additional stage with a view to its official adoption, i.e. a detailed analysis in a parliamentary committee, before coming back to all the partners for its final adoption. It should be remembered that with the adoption of this bill, the certificates of authorization issued would be suspended and that any new issuance would be postponed until the National Assembly has adopted a comprehensive legislative framework on exploration and development. exploitation of gas resources. The maximum duration of the moratorium established by the bill is five years.
Opposition members use the pretext that consultations should be held before rather than after the summary stage of adoption in principle, but this in no way justifies interrupting the process leading to the adoption of a law requested by citizens of the St. Lawrence Lowlands.
In his speech to the National Assembly, Minister Yves-François Blanchet asked, in vain, the elected representatives of the opposition to put the interests of citizens before their partisan interests. “On behalf of the tens of thousands of people who have marched in the streets, on behalf of the dozens of municipalities that have adopted bylaws to protect themselves, in the name of knowledge and science, I call on the opposition to have the courage and the simplicity of saying: We will adopt the principle in order to consult with the citizens of Quebec for the adoption of a moratorium on shale gas. &quot;
Note that it is not exceptional to hold special consultations after the adoption of a bill in principle. In the past year, six bills have followed this procedure, completely legitimate from a minority government facing opposition which seems determined to block consideration of a bill. It is therefore out of a concern not to conduct unnecessary consultations involving the expenditure of time and money on the part of several persons or groups that the government proposes to conduct these special consultations after the adoption of the principle. &quot;We do not want to do the trick of Bill 43 and waste precious time for citizens, municipalities and experts,&quot; explained Minister Blanchet.
“What is the position of the opposition MPs? Asks Minister Blanchet. Do they have no opinion on a moratorium on shale gas? Because wanting to wait to hear the groups before giving their position shows a certain lack of courage. &quot;
The CAQ, which promised a moratorium in its electoral platform in 2012, now takes an ambivalent position with regard to this project. On the set of the show Tout le monde en parle, its leader, Mr. François Legault, spoke out against the moratorium by asserting that such a project was &quot;a signal that we send to large companies that we do not have. &#39;is not interested in Quebec ”. A few months later, he said: &quot;It&#39;s a real moratorium where there is zero exploration, zero exploitation ... except for a few pilot projects where the Ministry of the Environment is there to monitor the work, accept the work before it is carried out. are not done ”(Le Devoir, August 11, 2012).
“With this bill, the Parti Québécois would fulfill a consensual commitment with great rigor, while respecting the concerns of citizens. In this context, it is up to the PLQ and the CAQ to prove to us that they are primarily at the service of the population and not at the service of special interests, ”concluded Minister Blanchet.
