Montreal - The decision of the Refugee Appeal Division not to make public the judgments handed down by this federal court, on the pretext that the translation is too expensive, “clearly shows that the Government of Canada has only one language of &#39;usage, English, and that French is the language of a minority that can be accommodated on occasion, when it does not cost too much, ”denounced the Minister of Immigration and Cultural Communities and Minister responsible for the Charter of the French language, Ms. Diane De Courcy. “As long as the federal government does not respect the common language of Quebec, we will oppose such decisions. &quot;
As the Official Languages Act requires the translation of decisions rendered by the courts, the Canadian government has chosen to circumvent the spirit of the law by deciding not to make all of the decisions public. “No one is supposed to ignore the law, as everyone knows, but how do you expect immigration lawyers to be able to adequately advise their clients, vulnerable people, if they do not have access to the relevant documentation? Minister Diane De Courcy worried.
This morning, the minister contacted her federal government counterpart, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Canada, Chris Alexander, to discuss this matter with him. She is still waiting for a return call.
