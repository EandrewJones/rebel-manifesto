Quebec - The MNA for Joliette and official opposition spokesperson for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, deplores the fact that the Minister of Culture and Communications, Hélène David, has put up for sale, on the sly, the one of the jewels of Quebec&#39;s cultural heritage, the Saint-Sulpice library.
What is most disturbing is that she used the classifieds to liquidate a part of our cultural history; there was no announcement, no press release, no explanations. “For a government that claims to be transparent, we will come back. The mandate of the Minister of Culture and Communications is to preserve the heritage, not to liquidate it! », Indignant the member.
Once again, we are witnessing a breach of commitment on the part of the Liberal government. Minister David said last October that she would launch a call for tenders to find a cultural vocation for the library. &quot;What is the minister&#39;s word worth?&quot; Liberal austerity knows no bounds and promises broken, obviously, either, ”continued Véronique Hivon.
The Saint-Sulpice library is one of the greatest testimonies of Quebec&#39;s cultural history; the Minister therefore has a duty to conserve and protect it. &quot;What has she been doing since arriving? Has she worked on projects that fit in with the cultural mission of this institution? Indeed, this building is not an ordinary building; it is a historic institution that is part of our heritage, ”added the MP.
&quot;Minister David must withdraw the sale of the Saint-Sulpice library, return to her commitments of fall 2014 and commit to consulting the community to find a solution that will respect the vocation of the building,&quot; concluded Véronique Hivon.
