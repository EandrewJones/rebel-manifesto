Sherbrooke– The comments I made do not reflect my thoughts on the subject. Pauline Marois is an exceptional woman, who is the most competent to be premier of Quebec. And that has absolutely nothing to do with her being a woman. This question has been settled for a long time. Quebeckers have gone elsewhere. They judge people based on what&#39;s on their minds and their skills. This is why I am convinced that Ms. Marois will succeed in bringing the Parti Québécois to power on September 4. I would not have applied for his team if I had not been convinced.
