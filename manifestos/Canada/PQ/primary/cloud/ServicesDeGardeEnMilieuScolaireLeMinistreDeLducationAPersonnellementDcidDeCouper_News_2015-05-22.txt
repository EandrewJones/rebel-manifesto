Quebec - The member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition critic for elementary and secondary education and school perseverance, Nicole Léger, once again notes that the Liberal Party&#39;s savage cuts are directly affecting services for parents and young people.
“Not only has the government decreed an increase in the fees for daycare services in schools from $ 7.30 to $ 8, but it has also decided to reduce its subsidies from 9% to 43%, depending on the number of young people attending the Guard Service. What this means is that parents will pay more to have even fewer services, ”denounced Nicole Léger.
“This time around, the government cannot try to blame the schools; it is a decision of the Minister of Education, François Blais, which he took by personally approving new budgetary rules, ”explained Ms. Léger.
Liberal speech is not credible
“For more than a year, the government has been repeating ad nauseam that education cuts do not affect student services. However, we have known for a long time that all this was only window dressing. The Liberal government must stop looking for scapegoats, ”the spokesperson concluded.
