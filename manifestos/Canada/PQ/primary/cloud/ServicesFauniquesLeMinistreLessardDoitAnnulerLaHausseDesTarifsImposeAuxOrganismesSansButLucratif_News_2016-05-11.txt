Quebec - The deputy for Bonaventure and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of forests, wildlife and parks, Sylvain Roy, urges Minister Laurent Lessard to cancel the drastic increase in fees for voluntary organizations that must pay for the obtaining a wildlife management permit, as it was published in the official Gazette of March 30.
“When it comes to wildlife management, the draft regulation makes no distinction between a non-profit organization, mainly made up of volunteers, and a private company. For example, volunteers should not have to pay $ 2,477 to obtain permission to work in the habitat of an endangered or vulnerable species, nor should they have to pay $ 506 to carry out work. development where fish are found. This price increase is a real user fee for volunteering and that is unacceptable! », Declared Sylvain Roy.
Questioned by the member during the period of oral questions and answers, today in the National Assembly, the Minister did not even seem to be aware of the consequences of the pricing that he imposes on voluntary organizations.
“Minister Lessard is completely out of touch when he denies imposing tariffs on voluntary organizations. On the ground, the volunteers are worried and wonder if they will be able to continue their work of preserving natural environments. The Minister must absolutely back down and cancel the imposition of these abusive tariffs on voluntary organizations, ”concluded the Member for Bonaventure.
