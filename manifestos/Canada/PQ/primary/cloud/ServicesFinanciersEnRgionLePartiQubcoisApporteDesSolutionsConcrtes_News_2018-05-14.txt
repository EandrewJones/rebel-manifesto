At the request of the Parti Québécois, the Territorial Planning Commission met on Monday to find solutions to the difficulties in accessing local financial services in the regions. Sylvain Gaudreault, whip of the official opposition and spokesperson for regional development and decentralization, presented concrete ideas in this direction.
IN SHORT
In parliamentary committee, discussions with financial institutions and municipalities made it possible to move forward in the search for solutions. “It is essential that both parties pool some of their infrastructures in order to reduce costs, which will make it possible to offer local financial services,” insisted Sylvain Gaudreault.
According to the spokesperson, the federal government must urge Canada Post to discuss with financial institutions and municipalities in order to put its resources at the service of the regions. “The post offices being present everywhere in the territory, they can be used to improve the services offered in the regions,” he said. The Parti Québécois&#39; questions have shown that post offices can be part of the solution.
In addition, currently, financial services in the regions are essentially based on a single financial institution: Desjardins. “Banks should also do their part,” added Sylvain Gaudreault. Access to true high-speed Internet service, no matter where you are in Quebec, would also help improve the situation. “On that, I have no congratulations for the Liberal government; he has been dragging his feet for too long, ”he lamented.
The member is satisfied with the holding of this parliamentary committee, the result of the leadership of the Parti Québécois. “My riding is located in the region; access to services is an issue that concerns me directly. I am happy that we were able to discuss it in the National Assembly. At the Parti Québécois, we are in &quot;solutions&quot; mode; the CAQ and the Liberal Party had nothing to suggest, ”he concluded.
