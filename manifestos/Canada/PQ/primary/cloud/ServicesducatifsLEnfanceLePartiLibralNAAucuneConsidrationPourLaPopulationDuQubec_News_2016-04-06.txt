Quebec - Following a working session of the Committee on Citizen Relations, the member for Labelle and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in family matters, Sylvain Pagé, denounces the total lack of consideration for the population of deputies Liberals, who refused to take note of the historic petition of 250,000 signatories demonstrating the importance of educational services to children, filed by the Quebec Association of early childhood centers.
“The arguments put forward by members of the Liberal Party to explain their decision made no sense and were purely dogmatic. More than 250,000 people have signed this petition, it is not nothing! A petition is an important democratic tool that we have given ourselves to allow the population to be heard. The Liberal government cannot just dismiss it out of hand; if he respects the citizens, he has a duty to take them into account, ”said the member for Labelle.
“Our network of childcare services is a source of pride for Quebec; many countries in the world envy us. However, the government&#39;s ideological choice hits hard on the quality of services offered to our children. Worse, the Liberals&#39; refusal to look into the future of childcare centers is further proof that they are governing without listening to the people, that they have no respect for their demands. In short, by having no consideration for the 250,000 petitioners, the Liberal MPs reaffirmed that they ignore citizen democracy, that they do not believe in the public network and that they will do nothing to protect it ”, Sylvain Pagé concluded.
