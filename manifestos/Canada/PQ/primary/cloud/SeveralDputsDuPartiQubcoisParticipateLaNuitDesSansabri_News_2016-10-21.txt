Quebec - Several members of the party will take part in the activities being held throughout Quebec on the occasion of the Night of the Homeless. It is an event to raise awareness of the reality of people living in poverty, social disaffiliation or homelessness.
The deputies François Gendron (Abitibi-Ouest), Guy Leclair (Beauharnois), Carole Poirier (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve), Véronique Hivon (Joliette), Pascal Bérubé (Matane-Matapédia), Martin Ouellet (René-Lévesque), Sylvain Rochon (Richelieu) ), Harold LeBel (Rimouski), Dave Turcotte (Saint-Jean) and Agnès Maltais (Taschereau) will take part in the activities in their respective regions.
This year, Homeless Night comes as the Liberal government persists in passing Bill 70, which uses a coercive approach to the most vulnerable. “In its current form, we do not believe the bill will break the circle of poverty. It attacks the poor more than it helps them, and feeds prejudices against welfare recipients. Imagine: the penalties provided for people who refuse to participate in the Objectif Emploi program are the same as those reserved for social assistance fraudsters! Throughout the process, we worried about the fate of homeless people, given the punitive approach of the Liberal government, ”commented Dave Turcotte, Parti Québécois spokesperson for Bill 70.
