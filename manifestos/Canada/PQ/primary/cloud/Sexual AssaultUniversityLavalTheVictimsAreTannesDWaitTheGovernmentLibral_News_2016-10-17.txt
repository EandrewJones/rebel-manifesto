Quebec - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for the status of women, Mireille Jean, as well as the spokesperson for education, research and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, are appalled by the series of sexual assaults that have occurred last weekend on the Université Laval campus. Their hearts go out to the victims of these acts; they want them to get all the support they need to get through this ordeal.
“After the events related to initiation activities that took place at the beginning of September, last Friday we had further proof that the situation is untenable on university campuses. Rather than making media outlets every time there is a fire, the Minister responsible for Higher Education, Hélène David, should convince her government that action must be taken at the source of the problem. It must first establish Quebec standards in the fight against sexual violence, then require post-secondary educational institutions to adopt internal policies that meet these standards; it&#39;s a question of consistency, ”said Alexandre Cloutier.
“The government strategy to prevent and counter sexual violence has been awaited for more than three years. What is the Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Lise Thériault doing? Since 2013, as there is no action plan, there has not been sufficient investment in this area. The consequences are significant: there are fewer and fewer preventive actions and, above all, the waiting lists and waiting times for dealing with victims&#39; complaints are dramatically lengthening. This is unacceptable! I ask Minister Thériault to table the new government strategy as soon as possible. I also demand that the budgets that will be devoted to it be substantial. I would also add that the meager $ 2 million over 5 years provided for in the last budget is clearly insufficient, compared to the $ 60 million allocated in the 2008-2013 action plan to the fight against sexual violence, ”concluded Mireille. Jeans.
