Quebec City - Berthier MP and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, and Taschereau MP and spokesperson on secularism, Agnès Maltais, deplore the carelessness the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Paradis, and the lack of leadership from the entire Liberal government when it comes to religious accommodations. Indeed, once again, on the occasion of the Feast of the Sheep, yesterday, hundreds of animals were slaughtered without recourse to the expertise of a recognized slaughterhouse.
“Pierre Paradis has been claiming for two years that animal welfare is his priority. However, during the study of Bill 54, he repeatedly refused the amendments proposed by the Parti Québécois to avoid unnecessary suffering to an animal called to be slaughtered. The CAQ, for its part, was reassured by the minister&#39;s comments, who said that our amendments were not necessary. Sylvie D&#39;Amours&#39; exit on this subject therefore surprised us a lot this morning, ”declared André Villeneuve.
“Added to this is the information, conveyed since the start of the day, that schools were closed yesterday for religious reasons. This is proof that in the absence of clear guidelines, the institutions, left to their own devices, are forced to operate on a case-by-case basis, ”continued Agnès Maltais.
“These two events demonstrate the inability of the Liberal government to intervene firmly when the time comes to regulate religious accommodations. Its action is guided solely by clientelism. We certainly believe that there must be a debate around reasonable accommodation. If we want this type of incident not to happen again, we must legislate and provide Quebec with clear guidelines, ”concluded the Member for Taschereau.
