Quebec - The MP for Vachon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on maritime strategy, Martine Ouellet, as well as the MP for Verchères and spokesperson for Quebec-Canada relations, Stéphane Bergeron, ask the Canadian government to sign quickly a firm contract with the Davie shipyard in Lévis so that the Resolve project, which consists of converting the MS Asterix into a supply ship for the Royal Canadian Navy, can go ahead.
Remember that the day before the federal election campaign began, Stephen Harper&#39;s government announced the signing of a letter of intent with Chantier Davie Canada, which authorized the start of work in August. The yard hoped for an official agreement to be reached before the end of October, but nothing has changed since.
“What is the point of a maritime strategy if the biggest client, Canada, shuns our shipyards and invests our money outside Quebec? What is the point if the Liberal government of Quebec is unable to make it listen to reason? While the Quebec Liberals are using public money for their advertising campaigns and their self-promotion, thousands of jobs, contracts and billions of dollars slip through our fingers. The Resolve project represents only $ 300M ... while Canadian contracts for $ 35B ships have been valued by the Canadian Auditor General at $ 100B! », Insisted Martine Ouellet.
“Do we need to remember that out of the $ 35 billion that the federal government has officially awarded in contracts over the last few years, absolutely nothing has gone to Canada&#39;s largest shipyard? To top it off, the Conservative government literally screwed us up with the vague possibility that Davie would get contracts just to get a few more votes on election day, but without giving any guarantees. However, despite these beautiful promises, we are still at the same point. The federal Liberal government must mitigate the injustice to which Quebec is a victim and quickly sign the Resolve project contract, ”claimed Stéphane Bergeron.
