Quebec - The MP for Vachon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of transport and maritime strategy, Martine Ouellet, and the MP for Verchères and spokesperson for Quebec-Canada relations, Stéphane Bergeron, deplore the government&#39;s decision Trudeau to delay the award of the contract for the conversion of a container ship into a military supply ship at the Davie shipyard.
“The Canadian government is still delaying the award of the contract for the Resolve project, a contract worth nearly $ 700 million for Davie. Meanwhile, the Couillard government stands idly by and claims to be the champion of the maritime industry. Instead of spending nearly $ 300,000 of Quebeckers&#39; money to advertise its maritime strategy, the PLQ government should instead focus on the Davie issue. Another proof that as long as Quebec is not independent, an effective maritime policy for Quebec will not be able to see the light of day ”, declared Martine Ouellet.
“Governments change, but history repeats itself. Ottawa has just set aside Quebec in awarding Royal Canadian Navy contracts. Remember that under the Harper government, $ 35 billion in contracts went to the rest of Canada, without a single dollar being awarded to Quebec. As for the Trudeau government, it did not take long to make a decision that puts Quebec at a disadvantage, ”concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
