All our thoughts go primarily to the victims and their loved ones. We share their grief and outrage. »

Over a hundred people have been injured or killed, and so many more, especially those held hostage, will live forever with appalling images and memories. Of course, we are also thinking of the members of the police, who courageously intervened, ”added the MP for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
“The people who were at the Pulse that night were there to celebrate. However, they have all been victims of an unspeakable injustice. We strongly denounce this act of nameless barbarism, ”concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
