Quebec - The member for Berthier and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, denounced, during an interpellation in the National Assembly, the inconsistency of Minister Pierre Paradis, who should invest in agriculture instead of cutting budgets and ignoring the demands of the next generation.
“Minister Paradis keeps repeating that the agri-food sector has a greater economic impact for Quebec than aeronautics. Why, then, did the government invest $ 1.3 billion in a bad deal with Bombardier, while it was cutting $ 151 million from the operating budgets of La Financière agricole? “Asked André Villeneuve.
“The Minister talks to us about the future, but he is not listening to the next generation. He instructed someone else to make a report, while the emerging young people have already presented him with concrete proposals. Why doesn&#39;t he listen to them? », Continued the deputy for Berthier.
André Villeneuve also underlined that Minister Paradis put an end to the Food Sovereignty Policy, pushing the audacity to remove it from the ministry&#39;s website, which is unusual for government policy. “The minister&#39;s predecessor, François Gendron, had the Food Sovereignty Policy adopted, which was welcomed by all stakeholders in the sector. Pierre Paradis, for his part, has chosen to remove all reference to this policy, in order to camouflage his own inaction. Farmers are not fooled; they understand that the Liberal Party is curbing the momentum of the agri-food sector, ”he concluded.
