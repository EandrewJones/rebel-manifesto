Québec– Jean-François Lisée, MP for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, youth protection, home care and prevention, and Carole, MP for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve Poirier, welcome the announcement that a first Montreal supervised injection site project will be authorized; they are asking the Liberal government to commit to providing the funds necessary for the project to come to fruition.
“Supervised injection sites not only encourage safe practices for drug users, who are at greater risk for infections or overdoses, but, in addition, they reduce the number of syringes left in public places and help decrease needle sharing. This is a project that will undoubtedly have positive repercussions in terms of public health, and which will help us to better fight against homelessness. We nevertheless hope that this time, the Minister for Rehabilitation will more actively defend Quebec&#39;s priorities, and more particularly this project, with the federal government, ”said Jean-François Lisée.
“Long awaited in Montreal, this announcement comes however in the midst of austerity; we therefore hope that the Liberal government will match the investments required for supervised injection sites to emerge. This is a promising project, a real bridge between prevention and reintegration, but which will require more than support on paper, ”added Carole Poirier.
The Member also wanted to underline all the work carried out, for many years, by the groups in the field to make this project a reality, in particular that of the Montreal public health department, of the teams working in the network of health, and the organizations Cactus Montreal, Specter de rue, Dopamine and L&#39;Anonyme. &quot;Without the commitment and collaboration of the latter and other stakeholders in the health sector, the community and the municipal level, this project would not have been possible,&quot; she concluded.
