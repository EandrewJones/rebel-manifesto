Quebec, November 30, 2017 - The leader of the official opposition, Jean-François Lisée, the spokesperson for immigration and cultural communities, Carole Poirier, and the spokesperson for Quebec-Canada relations, Nicolas Marceau, sent a letter today to the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, as well as to the Federal Minister of Immigration, Ahmed D. Hussen, asking them to act to prevent the young Leony Pavithra Lawrence and his family are deported to Sri Lanka this Sunday.
IN SHORT
“The case of Leony Pavithra Lawrence touched Quebeckers. She and her family represent a model, a success in terms of integration into Quebec society. Deportation is scheduled for Sunday; Justin Trudeau&#39;s government must act now, it has the means! Because to break the expectations and dreams of such a promising young woman, who has such great ambitions, that would be an aberration, ”said Jean-François Lisée.
“Leony Pavithra Lawrence would be deported, even if she was accepted at CEGEP, and she received a certificate of acceptance from Quebec as well as a study permit from the federal government. While everything suggested that she would be able to stay in Quebec and start her college course in January. The decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada is difficult to understand, to say the least; Ottawa must fix this mistake, ”added Carole Poirier.
“We call on the federal government to grant temporary residence permits to all family members on humanitarian grounds. The death threats to which they have been subjected in Sri Lanka clearly demonstrate that their security is not guaranteed. Note that this opinion is also that of Amnesty International, which asks for a grace period to shed light on this situation, ”concluded Nicolas Marceau.
