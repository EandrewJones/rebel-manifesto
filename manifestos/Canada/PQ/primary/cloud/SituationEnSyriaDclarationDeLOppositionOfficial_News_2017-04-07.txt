Quebec - The Leader of the Official Opposition, Jean-François Lisée, as well as the Parti Québécois spokesperson for international relations, Stéphane Bergeron, issued the following statement regarding the current situation in Syria.
“For several years, we have deplored and condemned the barbarism of the Syrian regime. The use of chemical weapons, moreover against civilians, is one of the worst war crimes that can be committed. Quebec must support any attempt to resolve the Syrian conflict, and that necessarily requires concerted action by the international community and the United Nations.
We support initiatives aimed at the annihilation of Daesh and the departure of Bashar al-Assad. This odious regime must imperatively be stopped so that the Syrian people can finally aspire to better days. In closing, we obviously have a thought for all the victims of the conflict, as well as for Quebeckers with family or close friends in Syria. &quot;
