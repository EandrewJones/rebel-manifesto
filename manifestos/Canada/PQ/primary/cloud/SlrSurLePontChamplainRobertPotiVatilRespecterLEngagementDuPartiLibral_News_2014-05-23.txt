Quebec - The MNA for Vachon and official opposition spokesperson for transport, Martine Ouellet, asks the Minister of Transport, Robert Poëti, to listen to the mayors of the South Shore and of Montreal on the issue of the system light rail (SLR) on the new Champlain Bridge.
“I ask Robert Poëti to take into account the consultations and the opinions of all the stakeholders in this file. The mayors, the AMT, the CMM, the STM, the STL, the Association du camionnage du Québec, among others, all agree. Like them, we believe that the SLR will become the new backbone of transport between the South Shore and Montreal, ”said Martine Ouellet.
This week, a report from the firm AECOM, having studied the different possible scenarios in the axis of the future bridge, concludes that the SLR dethrones the bus for this very busy corridor. In fact, from 2021, the bus will no longer be able to meet demand without very significant additional investments.
“In his opening speech, the Prime Minister said he was open to continuing the electrification of transport. The implementation of the SLR would make it possible to reduce the consumption of hydrocarbons and greenhouse gas emissions. Will Minister Poëti listen to the leader of his party and support the SLR? », Continued the spokesperson for the official opposition.
“The Liberal Party supported the SLR before and during the election. Will the minister keep his party&#39;s word? I ask him to be consistent with himself, to listen to all the stakeholders concerned and to support the SLR, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
