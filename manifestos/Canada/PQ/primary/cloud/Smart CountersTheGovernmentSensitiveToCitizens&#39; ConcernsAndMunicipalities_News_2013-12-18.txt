Quebec - The Quebec government is sensitive to the concerns expressed by many citizens and municipalities regarding the installation of new generation meters. To this end, it adopted a decree in which it expresses its concern regarding the pricing relating to the opt-out option.
“The adoption of this decree is part of a government initiative inviting Hydro-Québec to offer other technological or administrative solutions to its customers who do not want new generation meters. We hope that the Régie de l&#39;énergie will be sensitive to the concerns expressed by many citizens and municipalities, ”declared the Minister of Natural Resources, Ms. Martine Ouellet.
By this decree, the government also invites the Régie de l&#39;énergie to take into consideration the recommendations expressed by the National Assembly in a motion adopted unanimously on May 29. This unanimous motion reflects the will of the Members of the National Assembly to see Hydro-Québec evaluate options that do not penalize its customers who refuse smart meters and which make it possible to offer another type of meter free of charge (the costs are currently $ 137 upon installation and $ 206 annually).
It should be noted that the Régie asked Hydro-Québec, in a judgment rendered on December 2, to file its request for modification relating to the fees associated with the opt-out option as soon as possible.
