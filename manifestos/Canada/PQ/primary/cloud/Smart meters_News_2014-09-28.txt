Quebec - The MP for Marie-Victorin and official opposition critic for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, and the MP for Vachon and spokesperson for transport, Martine Ouellet, welcome the decision of the Régie de l&#39;énergie to reduce the fees charged by Hydro-Québec to citizens who refuse to install a smart meter.

“The Régie de l&#39;énergie made a good decision by lowering the fees that will be charged to citizens who choose not to have a new generation meter. The smart meters issue has been closely monitored by the Parti Québécois. We have always shown ourselves to be sensitive to the concerns of citizens and municipalities. This is the reason why our government had a decree adopted on this subject on December 11, 2013, ”recalled Bernard Drainville.
The decree reads as follows:
&quot;That the following economic, social and environmental concerns be indicated to the Régie de l&#39;énergie, relating to the pricing relating to the option to withdraw new generation meters:
- consider in the rates and conditions the concerns expressed by the National Assembly in a motion adopted unanimously on May 29, 2013 relating to the fees related to the opt-out option for new generation meters, which reads as follows :
&quot;That the National Assembly ask Hydro-Québec to evaluate other options so as not to financially penalize its customers who do not want&quot; smart &quot;meters and to offer them the choice of another type of meter without their impose punitive fees which are currently $ 137 at the facility and $ 206 annually. &quot; &quot;
The member for Vachon indicates for her part that citizens should not be bullied by the choices they make. “The decree was a strong gesture by the Parti Québécois government in the context where the Régie has exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the rates and conditions applicable to the opt-out option. The citizens who made the decision not to have a smart meter did not have to pay such a big penalty; we can only welcome the Régie&#39;s decision, which is a step in the right direction, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
