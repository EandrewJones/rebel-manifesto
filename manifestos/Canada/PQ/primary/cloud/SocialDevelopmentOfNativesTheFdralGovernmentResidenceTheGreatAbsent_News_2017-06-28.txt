Quebec - The official opposition spokesperson for Aboriginal affairs, education, research, school perseverance and literacy, Alexandre Cloutier, is delighted with the tabling of an action plan for development social responsibility of the aboriginal nations of Quebec, while reiterating that the federal government&#39;s disengagement remains the crux of the problem.
IN SHORT
“Prime Minister Trudeau speaks fine words. But the reality is that the federal government, for more than a decade, has completely disengaged from its responsibilities towards Aboriginals. Consequently, it is the government of Quebec which must take care of it ”, reacted immediately Alexandre Cloutier.
“According to data from the Secrétariat aux affaires autochtones, between 2003 and 2010, the government of Quebec alone assumed 75% of the increase in public transfers to native communities. Clearly, the federal government has stalled and is trying to break free from its obligations. There are many examples: police services, drug treatment, social housing, education, etc. ”, Enumerated the spokesperson.
Alexandre Cloutier insists: the success of Aboriginals, like that of all the nations of the world, depends first and foremost on education. “The federal government must take the necessary measures to promote educational success in Aboriginal communities; it is his responsibility, it is his duty, and he must not shirk, ”he concluded.
