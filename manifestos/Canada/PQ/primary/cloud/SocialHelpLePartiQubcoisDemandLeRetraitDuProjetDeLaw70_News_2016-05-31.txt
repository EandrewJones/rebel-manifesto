Quebec - The member for Saint-Jean and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of employment, social solidarity, the fight against poverty, vocational training, adult education, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte , asked the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, François Blais, to withdraw Bill 70, arguing, like many experts, that punitive measures are ineffective and backward.
“Since the tabling of Bill 70, which obliges new applicants for social assistance to join the Objectif emploi program, under penalty of sanctions, criticism has come from all sides. Imagine: a claimant could see their check cut by $ 224 per month, out of a total of $ 624. But who can live on just $ 400 a month? Asked the member for Saint-Jean.
Let us mention in passing that even the employers have doubts about the punitive measures imposed by this bill. In addition, 300 former colleagues of the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, academics, demanded its withdrawal.
The spokesperson also indicates that after more than 65 hours of parliamentary committee and many questions in the House, it is still impossible to know the results of the studies that have been carried out on Bill 70 with regard to the impacts it will have. might have on new welfare applicants. &quot;One thing is certain, the punitive part of the bill must be withdrawn, because it will undoubtedly entail serious consequences for them&quot;, he added.
“Several solutions have been proposed in parliamentary committee. The situation should not be limited to a simple employment assistance program; as a society, instead of penalizing new applicants for social assistance, we must invest more in the fight against dropping out of school, in francization and in literacy. And, if the government really wants to reduce the number of new applicants, it must present an incentive bill, not a punitive one, ”concluded Dave Turcotte.
