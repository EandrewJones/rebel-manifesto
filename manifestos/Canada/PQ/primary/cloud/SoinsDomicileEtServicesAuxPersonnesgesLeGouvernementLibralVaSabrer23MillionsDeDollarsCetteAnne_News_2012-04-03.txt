Quebec - The Parti Québécois today revealed to the National Assembly a hiding place of the latest budget presented by Raymond Bachand concerning care for the elderly.
In fact, last year in its budget, the Liberal government committed to allocate $ 200 million for its investment plan for seniors for the 2012-2013 fiscal year (page E111). However, for this same plan, in the last budget presented a few weeks ago, the government announced that it will finally devote $ 177 million to it (page 9). Net result: $ 23 million less for seniors.
“The Liberal government may well publish beautiful booklets and dangle huge amounts of money, the net result is that the investments promised to care for our seniors are not there. It is therefore not surprising that the Québec Ombudsman arrives at the same conclusion as us; our seniors are neglected by the current government, ”declared the Leader of the Official Opposition and Member of Parliament for Charlevoix, Pauline Marois.
“The Charest government has been promising us for months an action plan to better support our seniors and their families, but it already seems wishful thinking. By dint of reading the fine print in the budget documents, we unfortunately find bad news for our seniors, ”continued the MP for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for seniors, Carole Poirier.
The Parti Québécois considers it essential that Quebec make a major shift to better help our seniors and their families. &quot;It is certainly not by offering 25 cents more per day to natural caregivers, as the Charest government is doing, that we will make this important shift that is so necessary&quot;, concluded Carole Poirier.
