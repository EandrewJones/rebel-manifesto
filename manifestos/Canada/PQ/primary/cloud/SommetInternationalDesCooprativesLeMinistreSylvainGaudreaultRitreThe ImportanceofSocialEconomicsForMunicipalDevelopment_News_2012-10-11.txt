Quebec - The Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, took advantage of his participation in the International Summit of Cooperatives to reiterate the importance of the social economy for development communities in Quebec.
“Social economy enterprises contribute to the well-being of all regions of Quebec, in particular by offering goods and services that meet the specific needs of the communities they serve. This is why our government has chosen to support communities that choose the social economy as a development tool. This will will be embodied in a framework law that will be tabled in the National Assembly, ”said Minister Gaudreault.
“Co-operatives are important engines of job creation in all municipalities. In addition to contributing significantly to the economic development of Quebec, they promote the occupation of all territories, in particular by making it possible to maintain local services in remote regions ”, underlined Mr. Gaudreault.
Remember that Quebec has more than 7,000 collective enterprises, ie 3,300 cooperatives and mutuals as well as 3,700 NPOs, which include 1,000 early childhood centers (CPEs). These companies employ more than 125,000 people, which represents 8% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and a turnover exceeding 17 billion dollars. They offer products and services in innovative sectors as varied as those of traditional companies.
