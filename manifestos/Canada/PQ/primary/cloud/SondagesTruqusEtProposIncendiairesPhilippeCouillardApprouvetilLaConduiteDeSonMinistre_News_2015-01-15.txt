Quebec City - Taillon MP and official opposition spokeswoman on health and access to care, Diane Lamarre, denounces Minister Gaétan Barrette, who is trying to discredit doctors by acknowledging that he has -even rigged polls while he was president of the FMSQ.
“It is not because the minister used dishonest tactics that all the doctors in Quebec are without faith or law. At a time when Gaétan Barrette is dismantling the entire health system on the basis of a model that he alone has created from scratch, at a time when he oppresses, without the slightest respect, the majority of health professionals, in the the moment he admits to having tampered with reality, can we still believe him and trust him? It is so natural for him to employ questionable tactics that he bluntly admitted it at a press briefing yesterday, as if it was perfectly normal. Does the Prime Minister approve of his minister&#39;s conduct? Is rigging polls an acceptable practice for the Liberal Party? », Asked Diane Lamarre.
The Prime Minister must call his minister to order, otherwise it would mean that he is okay with his tactics. By encouraging the members of the FMSQ to respond “positively” and “with enthusiasm” to the surveys, Gaétan Barrette squarely incited medical specialists to lie in order to obtain salary increases of several billion dollars, a gain which, let us recall -le, earned him a bounty of $ 1.2 million last spring.
“How can the Prime Minister entrust to the Minister of Health, who demonstrates a more than questionable ethics, half of the budget of Quebec? When does he lie to us? When does it embellish reality? How can he believe his statements, now that he has admitted to having himself lied, candidly, without showing any discomfort? », Concluded the member of the Parti Québécois.
