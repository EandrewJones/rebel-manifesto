Québec, October 23, 2014 - Stéphane Bédard, MP for Chicoutimi and Leader of the Official Opposition, and Gaétan Lelièvre, MP for Gaspé and regional development spokesperson, denounce the Liberal government&#39;s desire to further centralize decisions, which reduces the tools and resources available to the regions of Quebec.
“Under the mask of austerity, the Liberal Party, with the support of the CAQ, made a deliberate choice to attack the means given to the regions to occupy their territory, assume their economic development and create jobs. We are witnessing an exercise of centralization around the ministries in Quebec, as if the Liberals knew better than the people on the ground how to serve their fellow citizens, ”declared Stéphane Bédard.
Bad liberal decisions reduce the proximity of services:
The member for Gaspé insisted on the essential contribution of CLDs to the economy of the regions. “The CLDs are places of consultation and action that encourage maximum local development and the communities taking charge of their future. They often prove to be the only professional and financial resources available to local and regional leaders in their hard fight for the dynamic occupation of their territory. If the CLDs are removed, several regions of Quebec risk losing their unique and essential tool for consultation and development, ”concluded Gaétan Lelièvre.
