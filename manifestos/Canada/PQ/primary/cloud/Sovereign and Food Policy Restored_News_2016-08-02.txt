Quebec - The member for Berthier and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, calls on the government to reinstate the Food Sovereignty Policy developed by the Parti Québécois.
“Our berry producers, for example, have great difficulty placing their products in supermarkets in Quebec, because they often prefer products from outside. This problem, like others, is the direct result of the Liberal government abandoning the Food Sovereignty Policy that was unveiled by the Parti Québécois government in 2013, ”explained André Villeneuve.
The member for Berthier recalled that this policy affirmed the clear and unequivocal desire to increase the proportion of Quebec products on our plates. “All stakeholders in the agrifood industry were mobilized to achieve this objective. However, the arrival of the Liberal government quickly put a brake on these efforts, ”he lamented.
“Today, we can see the negative effects of abandoning this policy on our producers. Without government support, they find themselves unable to face international competition, which sells its surpluses on the Quebec market. In order to ensure the prosperity of our entire agricultural sector, it is therefore essential that the Government of Quebec re-establish the Food Sovereignty Policy, and quickly, ”concluded André Villeneuve.
