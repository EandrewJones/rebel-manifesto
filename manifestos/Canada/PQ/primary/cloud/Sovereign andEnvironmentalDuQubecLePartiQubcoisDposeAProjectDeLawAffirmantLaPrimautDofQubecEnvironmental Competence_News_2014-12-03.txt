Quebec– Sylvain Gaudreault, the member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and the environment, tabled Bill 390, An Act to amend the Environment Quality Act in order to affirm the primacy of Quebec&#39;s jurisdiction in this matter.
This bill is the result of several months of legislative work to ask the Quebec government to assume its jurisdiction in environmental matters. It is also a bill that conveys the concerns of civil society and Quebeckers regarding control over their territory. “It is the culmination of a national affirmation process. In 1962, being &quot;masters at home&quot; was made concrete by the nationalization of electricity by René Lévesque. Today, Quebec must have all the legislative tools necessary to control its environmental and energy future, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
Quebecers unfortunately do not yet have full control of their territory, and we cannot count on the National Energy Board or the federal government to protect the environment. As a political party, we come to the conclusion that it is by affirming the primacy of Quebec&#39;s jurisdiction in this matter that Quebecers will be able to guarantee the protection of the environment. “The Energy East project does not correspond to the values of Quebecers, who do not want their territory to become a highway for the export of oil from the tar sands. Giving primacy to Quebec&#39;s environmental jurisdiction means allowing the government of Quebecers to say no to projects that are harmful to their natural resources, ”added the Member for Jonquière.
With this bill, the Parti Québécois is continuing its process of reappropriating power from Quebecers and for recognition of the importance of a rigorous environmental assessment.
