Quebec - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, is delighted with the support received for the motion she tabled in the National Assembly on Tuesday, proposing the establishment of a special parliamentary committee on sexual violence against women.
“The national women&#39;s groups declared themselves this morning in favor of the proposal that I submitted on Tuesday. I am happy to note that there is a desire shared by civil society to hold a deep reflection on the causes and consequences of sexual violence, as well as on the appropriate ways to prevent it. Violence against women is unacceptable. We must collectively - because it is a social issue - look into the issue, assess the effectiveness of current tools, and determine which ones to put in place to remedy it.
The member wished to remind that this necessary discussion must be held quickly. She also met with the Minister responsible for the Status of Women and the Member for Gouin last night to examine the terms and conditions under which this commission could be set up.
“The recent wave of denunciations of sexual assault in the media and on social networks concerns us all. I hope that the societal discussion that we can hope for with a special parliamentary committee will be done in an open manner, and that it will allow everyone to speak. It is important that men too are included in the process. Finally, this commission should enable us to better identify the forms of violence and harassment of a sexual nature, so that we can adequately counter them, ”concluded Carole Poirier.
