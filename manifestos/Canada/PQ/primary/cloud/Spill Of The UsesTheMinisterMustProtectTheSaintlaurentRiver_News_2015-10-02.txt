Quebec - The member for Terrebonne and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of sustainable development, the environment and the fight against climate change, Mathieu Traversy, is worried that the City of Montreal has announced that it intends to proceed with the discharge of eight billion liters of wastewater into the St. Lawrence River. On behalf of the Parti Québécois, he is asking the Minister of the Environment to suspend the authorization given to the City of Montreal, so that all the options can be assessed and the least damaging and most sustainable solution can be chosen.
“The Quebec state is the guardian of the common heritage that is our water. The Minister must immediately apply the principles of precaution, environmental protection and respect for the support capacity of ecosystems, and order a more in-depth analysis of the situation. The opinion of independent experts is essential to assess the option that will limit the environmental impacts the most, ”said Mathieu Traversy.
In recent days, several scientists, social and environmental collectives, mayors and citizens have expressed their major concerns, believing that the water quality of the St.Lawrence River is at stake, as well as ecosystems of national interest, such as the lake Saint-Pierre. The Ministry of the Environment has a responsibility for the management of wastewater; it must act immediately, they expressed.
Moreover, in this matter, the official opposition demands transparency from the Minister of the Environment. “The population is demanding more transparency from the Ministry of the Environment. All the analyzes that led him to give his authorization must be made public. Like other groups, we want to know if this analysis was carried out by people with the competence to pass judgment on the construction methods proposed by the City. The principle of access to knowledge is one of the principles of sustainable development, ”concluded Mathieu Traversy.
