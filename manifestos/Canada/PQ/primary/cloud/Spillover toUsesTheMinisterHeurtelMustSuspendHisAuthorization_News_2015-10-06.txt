Quebec - The member for Terrebonne and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of sustainable development, the environment and the fight against climate change, Mathieu Traversy, reiterates his request to the Minister of the Environment, David Heurtel, that the suspension be suspended the authorization granted to the City of Montreal to discharge eight billion liters of wastewater into the St. Lawrence River, as Environment Canada is now demanding, and for all opinions and analyzes on which he based himself on to make his decision.
“It is all the same incredible to see that the Conservative government is quicker to protect the St. Lawrence River and its wildlife than the Government of Quebec. Passing off the Conservatives as defenders of the environment is a real feat! », Affirmed Mathieu Traversy.
For several days, the Parti Québécois has been asking the Minister of the Environment to suspend the authorization given to the City of Montreal so that we can assess all the options and ensure that the least damaging and most sustainable solution is chosen.
“The minister has been aware of this situation for months, and we should take his word for it when he says that the spill is the only possible solution, and that there will be minimal impacts on the environment and public health? Rather, it should be transparent and provide all the relevant information to the public, ”continued the deputy.
“The minister no longer has any credibility. We again ask for his resignation, as we did several months ago, following his irresponsible management of the drilling file in Cacouna, and when he backed down on the holding of a BAPE on the Port of Quebec project, ”concluded Mathieu Traversy.
