Quebec - The MNA for Rimouski and Official Opposition Critic for Seniors, Harold LeBel, as well as the MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and Housing Critic, Carole Poirier, have expressed their concerns in connection with the government&#39;s announcement concerning the installation of sprinklers in retirement homes.
“The tragedy of the Résidence du Havre, in L&#39;Isle-Verte, is always remembered when we talk about fire protection or security in retirement homes. There is no compromise to be made when it comes to the safety of seniors in Quebec. We welcome the Minister&#39;s announcement on the sprinklers, but there are still several questions he has not answered, ”said Harold LeBel.
&quot;Who will pay for the installation of these sprinklers and what form will this funding take?&quot; Will housing NPOs benefit from financial assistance? All of these questions are complex, and we have no answers. We also have questions about the five-year deadline, which seems long to us, but we will give the runner a chance, ”continued Carole Poirier.
The member for Rimouski also specified that various measures taken by the government can compromise actions for the safety of seniors. “The Treasury Board keeps government employees in their offices by imposing several markers on their movements. Can inspections be compromised? In addition, health agencies have been entrusted with the inspection and regulation of residences. With the intermixing of structures of Minister Barrette, who will henceforth be responsible? &quot;, he added.
Finally, Harold LeBel wonders where the Minister responsible for Seniors, Francine Charbonneau, was today; he would have liked her to present her overall plan for the supervision and safety of seniors.
