Montreal - The Minister of Justice and Member of Parliament for Chambly, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, on behalf of the Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, is pleased to underline the end of the extension work on the incentive parking lot on Boulevard Fréchette, in Chambly.
Carried out by the Agence métropolitaine de transport and fully funded by the Ministère des Transports at a cost of $ 100,000, the parking lot expansion increased its capacity by 50 spaces, for a total of 460.
“Public transit has always been a priority commitment of our government. For it to be effective, the infrastructures in place must concretely meet the needs of users. These new parking spaces will facilitate the use of carpooling and public transit and will consequently reduce automobile traffic. Everyone benefits from it, ”said Mr. St-Arnaud.
