Quebec City, June 9, 2017 - Today, the official opposition spokesperson for health, access to care and home support, Diane Lamarre, tabled a petition denouncing the increase in fees. parking of health establishments in Quebec and their application to CHSLDs, CLSCs and other public services.
IN SHORT
Initiated by the Alliance of Professional and Technical Personnel in Health and Social Services (APTS), this petition denounces the policy presented last summer by the Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette, regarding hospital parking. This has resulted in a significant increase in rates, and the application of rates to many previously free places, such as CHSLDs and CLSCs.
“This policy has significant impacts, particularly in regions where users do not have the choice of taking their car to get to the hospital, if they do not have a public transport service. There are also spouses, families and friends who visit a loved one in a CHSLD, helping to break their isolation. Does the minister know that he is thus creating a &quot;disincentive&quot; to visit them? Let us also think of the most vulnerable people, often in low income, who are the most in need of health care; they will be penalized by this directive ”, raised Diane Lamarre.
“We hope that the Minister of Health will be sensitive to the reality on the ground and that he will withdraw this unfair policy. Parking fees in the health network must not become a new disguised tax aimed particularly at Quebecers who need more care or the presence of a loved one, ”concluded the spokesperson.
