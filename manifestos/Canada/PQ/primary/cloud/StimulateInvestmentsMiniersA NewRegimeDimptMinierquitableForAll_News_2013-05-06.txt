Quebec - The Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau, and the Minister of Natural Resources, Ms. Martine Ouellet, today presented Quebec&#39;s new mining tax regime. “The government&#39;s ambition is to make Quebec one of the most prosperous places in the world, by prioritizing private investment. This prosperity must benefit all Quebecers. It is in this context that we are presenting the new Quebec mining tax regime, ”said Minister Marceau.
“Quebecers were right to be dissatisfied with the liberal regime since some companies could perpetuate the exploitation of natural resources without paying a cent in royalties for a long period of time. Moreover, when huge profits were made due to sudden price increases, the share of profits paid out as royalties did not increase. We are presenting a royalty regime that is fair to citizens and that ensures the realization of mining investment projects, ”said the Minister of Finance.
The ministers stressed that the government is bringing two major initiatives to the mining tax regime. First, it ensures that all mining operations will henceforth be required to pay mining tax, which was not the case until now.
From now on, all mine operators operating in Quebec will have to pay a minimum mining tax, applied to the value of the ore at the head of the shaft. To take into account the reality of smaller operations and facilitate the start-up of mining projects, the extraction rate will be set at 1% for the first $ 80 million of minerals extracted. On the excess, the rate will be 4% of the value of the minerals extracted.
