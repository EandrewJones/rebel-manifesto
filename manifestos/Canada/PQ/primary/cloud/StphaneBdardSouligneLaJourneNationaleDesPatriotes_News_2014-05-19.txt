Quebec - The leader of the official opposition invites the population to celebrate National Patriots&#39; Day and to take the opportunity to remember the history of Quebec.

Let us remember our history, marked by these struggles aiming for more solidarity and more freedom for our people.

It was in 2002 that the Government of Quebec proclaimed, by decree, the National Patriots&#39; Day, established on the Monday preceding May 25 of each year. Thus, we wanted to better promote the events of May 1837 when the Patriots held public meetings across Quebec after the London government refused to accept their demands. The text of the decree stipulates that &quot;this holiday will underline the struggle of the patriots from 1837 to 1838 for the national recognition of our people, for their political freedom and for obtaining a democratic system of government&quot;.
