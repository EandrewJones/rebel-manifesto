Quebec - The Minister of Families, Ms. Nicole Léger, wishes to clarify the actions taken by the Ministère de la Famille in order to offer safe and quality childcare services to Quebec children. Several actions are currently being implemented to counter illegal custody.
“The safety and quality of our childcare services are a priority. We are acting on several fronts in order to offer our children daycare services that meet all requirements and that offer them a living environment first and foremost that is safe, but also stimulating and positive for their development. The Recognized Childcare Service logo displayed in childcare services is a sign of quality and compliance, ”said Minister Nicole Léger.
The Action Strategy to Counter Illegal Childcare was adopted in May 2013. It is divided into four areas: the creation of places at $ 7, awareness of illegal childcare, detection of illegal childcare services and &#39;application of sanctions if necessary.
In addition, the creation of 28,000 places at $ 7 announced last November by Minister Nicole Léger is an important action to support interventions against illegal childcare. Consolidating the $ 7 daycare network allows parents to benefit from quality daycare services.
“I invite parents in Quebec to be vigilant and not to hesitate to consult the Ministry of the Family for any question on this subject. It is important that parents are made aware of this risk and do not hesitate to point out problematic situations to us so that we can take appropriate measures. You should know that the majority of childcare centers comply with the Act respecting childcare services. The goal is to properly support faulty childcare services so that they comply, ”said Minister Nicole Léger.
The Action Strategy to Counter Illegal Child Care can be found on the website of the Ministère de la Famille at www.mfa.gouv.qc.ca.
