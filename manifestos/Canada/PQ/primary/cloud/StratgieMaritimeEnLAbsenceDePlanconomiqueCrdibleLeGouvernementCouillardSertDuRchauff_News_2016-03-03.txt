Quebec - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of transport, maritime strategy, transport electrification and digital strategy, Martine Ouellet, notes that the Couillard government, completely down for everything related to the economy , hastens to serve the reheated to Quebecers, who therefore remain waiting for the tabling of a real government economic development plan.
“The sums announced this morning have already been announced with great fanfare when the Maritime Strategy was unveiled last June. Failing to have raised interest at that time, the government is trying to give its announcement a second spin, by repeating it this morning! ”, Estimates the member.
The Parti Québécois recalls that the local committees that the minister wants to form already exist in several places, such as Sorel-Tracy, Port-Cartier and Bécancour. Fortunately, these regions did not wait for the signal from Minister D&#39;Amour to mobilize!
“Going over the same investments, announcement after announcement, does not replace a real economic development strategy for our regions and for the St. Lawrence Valley. It is sad to note that after two years of Liberal government, Minister D&#39;Amour has just realized that there are at least 16 places in Quebec with industrial port investment needs, ”concluded Martine Ouellet. .
