Quebec - The member for Sanguinet and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of economy, energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, is particularly disappointed with the Quebec Aerospace Strategy 2016-2026, unveiled this morning.
“The strategy presented does not contain any new or innovative ideas, nor does it set a target for job creation. How does the government plan to measure its success without setting a target? If the Liberal government itself doubts that its strategy will create jobs, how can Quebeckers trust the Liberals to implement it? Let us remember Aerolia, a success story for the Parti Québécois in terms of attracting large integrators. We had delivered, while the Liberals are content to promise or, worse, abandon the workers, as was the case for the 1800 Aveos, ”lamented the member for Sanguinet.
&quot;Moreover, if the will, on paper, of the Liberal government to seek Quebec&#39;s share in federal defense contracts is to be welcomed, we must question the fact that Quebec does not receive it naturally, and this every time. once a federal contract is awarded. Why do we have to beg, when 20% of the amounts spent come from Quebecers&#39; taxes? Moreover, why does the federal government not support our aeronautics sector, as it does with the automobile industry in Ontario, with enormous funds? This was still the case in the last Morneau budget, ”added the spokesperson.
“The Minister of the Economy, Science and Innovation, Dominique Anglade, clearly failed the innovation test. Its aerospace strategy, which it had presented as having to instill confidence in the future in Quebecers, is unfortunately a digest of commonplaces, ”concluded Alain Therrien.
