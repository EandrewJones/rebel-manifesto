Quebec, February 16, 2017– The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois for issues affecting the drug industry, Dave Turcotte, and the spokesperson for education, research, school perseverance and literacy, Alexandre Cloutier, note that the conflict between pharmacists and the Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette, now threatens the training of new pharmacists. The members of the Parti Québécois held a press briefing on this subject, accompanied by Nicolas Lavallée, president of the Quebec Student Union, Nicolas St-Onge, president of the Association of Pharmacy Students of the University of Montreal , and Raphaël Gagnon-Paradis, president of the General Association of Pharmacy Students.
“Because the Minister of Health has taken a series of unilateral decisions concerning the world of pharmacy, many pharmacists can no longer accommodate trainees. Unable to find an internship, some 70% of pharmacy students in Quebec could see their path in jeopardy. We ask the Minister of Health to negotiate in good faith with pharmacists, ”said Dave Turcotte.
“The conflict between the Minister of Health and pharmacists is taking on disproportionate proportions. The students are taken hostage. If the situation persists, more than 350 students will see their curriculum turned upside down next September. How many will be leaving the program? The Minister responsible for Higher Education must defend the students, because they find themselves stuck in this conflict, ”added Alexandre Cloutier.
“The situation is worrying and, the longer it persists, the more we fear that it will degenerate into an acute crisis. It is high time for the government and pharmacists to make this issue a priority and place the well-being of students at the heart of their concerns, ”concluded Nicolas Lavallée.
