Quebec - The member for Berthier and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, notes that after two and a half years in office, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Paradis, has still not developed an agri-food strategy, made necessary by the abolition, by the liberals, of the Food Sovereignty Policy.
“When he came to power in 2014, the first thing Pierre Paradis did was put the ax on the Food Sovereignty Policy, which had nevertheless received praise from the entire agrifood industry. Two and a half years later, the minister has no strategy, no concrete plan to revive the sector. After thirty months, all the Liberal government has to offer is consultation. Where was the minister all this time? He had more than two years to consult. What farmers and processors are asking for is an agri-food strategy that will allow them to realize their full potential. By only launching a process prior to a possible summit, Minister Pierre Paradis lamentably misses the target, ”declared André Villeneuve.
Almost a year ago, a coalition of agri-food players, led by the Union des producteurs agricoles and the Quebec Food Processing Council, called for a strategy. “The needs of the agrifood sector are well known. Producers and processors are well aware of consumer demands, and Minister Paradis dares to tell them that they are not listening. Does he know that all the stakeholders agree that he himself has serious shortcomings in this area? He&#39;s been in his budget-cutting office for two and a half years without speaking to anyone, and suddenly he decides it&#39;s the farmers and processors who aren&#39;t consulting consumers. The minister should leave his office and visit one of the many dynamic companies operating in the sector; in this way, he will be able to understand, or even see, how they constantly consult consumers and inquire about their needs, ”concluded André Villeneuve.
