Quebec - The Member of Parliament for Johnson and Official Opposition critic for recreation and sports, Etienne-Alexis Boucher, welcomes the announcement made this morning concerning the holding of a Hockey Summit jointly led by Hockey Quebec, the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) and the Montreal Canadiens.
For several years, our national sport has frequently made negative headlines. “The events surrounding the Roy-Nadeau and Pacioretty-Chara cases; the many discussions surrounding concussions; as well as the brawls and violence in general in this sport elicited more reactions than the practice of the sport itself. We need to think about violence in hockey. After the Roy-Nadeau incident, some actions were taken following the filing, in August 2008, of the report of the advisory committee set up by the QMJHL, ”said Etienne-Alexis Boucher.
Since 2009, the director of the Montreal Canadiens hockey club, Mr. Pierre Boivin, has expressed his wish for such a summit to be held. “With this summit, all the organizations and stakeholders dedicated to the development of hockey in Quebec will have the opportunity to reflect in order to ensure that the regulations allow safe hockey practice, from the youngest to the professionals. In doing so, we will see a culture shift towards our national sport, ”added MP Johnson.
“Several other aspects of Quebec hockey will have to be addressed, whether it be the structure of Quebec minor hockey, doping, the continued education of players, accessibility to practice and the under-representation of French-speaking players in the NHL. This is why the Parti Québécois made it an important subject at its last national convention and strongly hopes that this summit will be an important moment in the development of Quebec hockey, ”concluded the spokesperson for the official opposition. in leisure and sports.
