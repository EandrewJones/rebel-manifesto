Quebec - A little over a month after the Summit on Higher Education was held, the Minister of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology, Mr. Pierre Duchesne, officially launches the consultations surrounding the five projects created at the end of the Summit.
“Already, work on the projects on financial aid for studies and on the National Council of Universities is well underway and the others will begin this week. By the end of the week, I will have had the opportunity to talk to all the site presidents, ”said Minister Duchesne.
As part of their work, the site presidents will consult all the partners of the Summit on higher education who so wish. In addition, like the preparatory process for the Higher Education Summit, the work will be accessible on the Web. A new section providing more information on each of these projects is available on the Ministère&#39;s website at www.mesrst.gouv.qc.ca / chantiers.
Those interested in submitting suggestions or contributions can do so now by accessing this section. Each workcamp has an e-mail box that allows you to reach the president and send any document related to the mandate. It should be remembered that at the end of the Summit on Higher Education, the Government of Quebec opened five work sites.
These projects bear witness to our desire to bring about major reforms in higher education. A tight deadline was given to the site presidents in order to promote the efficiency of the work, because the results are expected not only by the partners in higher education, but by all Quebecers. We are keeping our commitments and we are acting promptly, ”concluded Minister Duchesne.
