Quebec - The member for Marie-Victorin and official opposition spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, is concerned about the remarks of the Prime Minister, Philippe Couillard, who downplays the impacts and issues of safety related to the passage of supertankers on the St. Lawrence River.
“If the federal government wants the St. Lawrence to become a highway for exporting bituminous oil from Alberta, Quebeckers have the right to say no. They even have a duty to say no, to protect our river and the integrity of our territory. It is up to the Government of Quebec to say no on our behalf, ”said Bernard Drainville.
Today, in response to questions from the deputy, Philippe Couillard said:
&quot;Why is it a problem for an oil tanker to increase from 32 to 44 meters - is that the number?&quot; - if it goes from west to east or from east to west? What is this story? What is this salad, Mr. President? &quot;
“The lightness and flippancy with which the Prime Minister has viewed the matter today is disturbing. Barely a year ago, only ships less than 32 meters wide could travel on the river. Philippe Couillard sees no problem with Ottawa having changed the regulations to allow larger tankers, up to 44 meters, to simply cross the river. However, the regulations adopted by the federal government are tailor-made for supertankers. We are talking about giant ships whose hulls pass less than a meter from the bottom of the river when they are two-thirds loaded, ”added the deputy.
“Does the Prime Minister understand that we are talking about the supply of drinking water for Quebecers? Can the government explain to us why Quebec agrees to take that risk? Where is our interest? Why accept that the river becomes a simple export route for oil from the West? “Asked Bernard Drainville.
