Quebec - The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, announces the allocation of financial assistance of $ 4,690,799 to various community media across Quebec.
For the year 2013-2014, 81 printed media, 40 terrestrial radio stations, 35 conventional televisions and 4 online media will therefore receive support for their operation.
“Community media are valuable vectors of information and essential to the vitality of our regions. They are anchored in all the communities of Quebec and accomplish remarkable work there, thus creating a space for discussion dealing with the concerns and issues that are dear to our fellow citizens, ”said Minister Kotto.
This financial assistance is part of the Operating Assistance program for community media. The program, updated last June, now adapts to the new realities of community media and supports them in the pursuit of their citizen information mission. Among other changes, we note the opening of the program to online community media. The Internet has undoubtedly become an essential communication tool, and the Ministry of Culture and Communications supports community media in the context of the digital shift.
Operating aid for community media aims to diversify the supply of local and regional information. It also helps to strengthen and encourage the participation of the population in local initiatives and decision-making. This financial support from the Department represents a source of stability for the organizations and ensures their sustainability.
The Operating Assistance program for community media is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. Since 1973, the government has supported these organizations, which it sees as a concrete investment in the field of communications. Only one community media was supported when the program was created. In 2013-2014, 160 community media will receive support for their operation. These figures clearly show that this sector is in constant development.
