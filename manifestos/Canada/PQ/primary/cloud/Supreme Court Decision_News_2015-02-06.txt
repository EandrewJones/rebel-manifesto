Collectively, Quebec has paved the way, ”said Stéphane Bédard.
“The Supreme Court&#39;s decision recognizes the Quebec approach of the Special Commission on the Question of Dying with Dignity as well as the Act respecting end-of-life care. I pay tribute to the people who came to testify and who took part in this great democratic exercise. It is the meeting of many courage, citizens, associations and elected officials that allowed the adoption of this law and the shaping of the decision rendered this morning, ”concluded the Member for Joliette.
