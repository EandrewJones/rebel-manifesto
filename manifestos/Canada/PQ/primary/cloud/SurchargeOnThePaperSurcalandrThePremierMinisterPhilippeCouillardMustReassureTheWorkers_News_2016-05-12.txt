Quebec - Along with representatives of forest workers from the Saguenay – Lac-Saint-Jean region, including several from the Kénogami and Dolbeau-Mistassini factories, the member for Jonquière and leader of the official opposition, Sylvain Gaudreault, as well as the member for Bonaventure and the Parti Québécois spokesperson for forests, Sylvain Roy, insisted that the Prime Minister act quickly on the issue of the surtax which afflicts the producers of supercalendered paper, and that he reassures workers.
“Last October, the US Department of Commerce determined that Quebec producers of supercalendered paper should pay a surtax. The factories in Kénogami, in Saguenay, and Dolbeau-Mistassini, in Lac-Saint-Jean, have since had to pay an 18% tax on the paper they export to the United States. That represents additional costs, for each, of more than 1 million dollars per month. The situation is becoming dangerous for the future of these two factories located in my region, also that of the Prime Minister. Workers are with us today and they are worried. The Prime Minister said that there was a delay on the federal side. He doesn&#39;t seem to realize the situation is serious. He must reassure the workers, act with diligence and force. I remind him of the closure of Graphic Packaging last summer, which could have been avoided if he had acted, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
“Since 2005, more than 20,000 direct jobs have been lost in wood processing. Some 286 factories have closed. There are two others that pose a very serious threat. A closure, even temporary, could allow American competitors to take the market for our factories. The Minister of Forests must assume his responsibilities and ask Ottawa to cancel this surtax, which threatens forest communities in Quebec, ”said Sylvain Roy.
