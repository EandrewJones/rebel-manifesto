Quebec - The MNA for Taschereau and official opposition spokesperson for health, Agnès Maltais, is stunned by the new direction of the Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, who no longer has a specific deadline so that illegal overcharging for the injection of the drug Lucentis.
“Last February, Minister Bolduc promised to put an end to this illegal practice of overbilling in the days to come. Three months later, he is now unable to keep his promise and is content with empty and unconvincing sentences. Meanwhile, thousands of people are victims of the minister&#39;s inaction. This is unacceptable, ”said Agnès Maltais.
This afternoon at the National Assembly, the member for Taschereau tabled a petition of 3,700 signatories calling for an end to this illegal overbilling, in the presence of people suffering from macular degeneration. To date, more than 4,200 people have called for the minister&#39;s intervention.
“Minister Bolduc&#39;s words do nothing to reassure these people. Rather than sending a clear directive to the health network or to the Régie de l&#39;assurance maladie du Québec to put an end to this practice, it is now waiting for an action plan from each establishment. Worse, people with macular degeneration are at the center of a negotiation of which they are paying the price, the minister himself admitting that he is taking this opportunity to negotiate with the medical federations on incidental costs. It is shameful. The sight of thousands of people is in danger, ”denounced Ms. Maltais.
“Yves Bolduc must stop acting as a technocrat and realize that through his inaction thousands of people are suffering. It is its primary duty to preserve the health of citizens and to enforce our laws by putting an end as of now to the illegal overbilling practiced since 2009 for this type of treatment, ”concluded Agnès Maltais.
