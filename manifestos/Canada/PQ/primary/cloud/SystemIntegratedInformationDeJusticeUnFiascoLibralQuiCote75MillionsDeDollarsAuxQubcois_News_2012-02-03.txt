Quebec - The MNA for Joliette and official opposition critic for justice, Véronique Hivon, denounces the fiasco of the Integrated Justice Information System (SIIJ) which, due to the incompetence of the government, has cost $ 75 million to Quebecers without any results.
“Yesterday, we learned that the government was suspending the project to create an SIIJ, even though it has already cost $ 75 million. This announcement is the latest development in a saga that has lasted for years and has been marked by liberal incompetence at all stages. There was a change of approach in 2004, then a call for tenders in 2006, then a suspension of the project and another call for tenders in 2010. In 2012, when $ 75 million of the 105 million authorized for this project have already been started, only 20% of the project is developed! In the meantime, the Auditor General has not failed to denounce that the SIIJ was not managed with a concern for economy and efficiency, ”said Véronique Hivon.
On several occasions, the official opposition justice critic has asked the government questions about the JIS. “In the spring of 2011, I questioned the Minister of Justice on the progress of the work of the SIIJ and he replied that the project was well under way, that he was satisfied with the progress of the work. However, less than a year later, the President of the Conseil du trésor suspended the project because it was doomed to failure. Why has the Minister of Justice been so lax in this matter? How could he allow a waste of 75 million dollars when his ministry has to be content with barely 1% of the total state budget and the needs in terms of access to justice are glaring? The minister regularly invokes the lack of resources to refuse to respond to requests from victims and groups working for access to justice. With this SIIJ scandal, we are entitled to wonder how Minister Fournier manages his ministry and his priorities, ”concluded Véronique Hivon.
