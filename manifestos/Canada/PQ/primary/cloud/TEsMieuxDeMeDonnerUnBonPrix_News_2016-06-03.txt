Quebec - Following the alleged remarks of the Minister of Transport, Jacques Daoust, reported by the ex-president of Rona, Robert Dutton, on the airwaves of 98.5 FM on the program Dutrizac, the parliamentary leader of the opposition official, Bernard Drainville, reiterated the demand of the Parti Québécois: Minister Jacques Daoust must step down.
During a meeting with Mr. Dutton in August 2012, Minister Jacques Daoust, then at Investissement Québec, reportedly said:
“I don&#39;t want to know anything about Rona. Me, I&#39;m going to lose my job; all that interests me is having a vineyard and you better give me a good price. Because I am going to do big renovations then I want to have good prices on my vineyard. &quot;
“It never ends, with Minister Daoust. The only thing that interested him, when we were going to lose a head office, was his vineyard? These comments are added to all the blunders of this minister. Whether at Investissement Québec, as Minister of the Economy or Minister of Transport, the problems accumulate around him. He should no longer have the confidence of the Prime Minister, ”declared Bernard Drainville.
