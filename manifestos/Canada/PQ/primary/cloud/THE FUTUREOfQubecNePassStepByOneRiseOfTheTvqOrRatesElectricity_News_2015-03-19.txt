Quebec– The member for Rousseau and official opposition critic for finance and revenue, Nicolas Marceau, took note of the report of the Quebec tax review committee, chaired by Luc Godbout.
“We are open to discussion and debate on possible improvements to our taxation. However, there are lines to be drawn; for example, we refuse any increase in the QST. We are already the place in North America with the highest sales tax; an increase would hurt our businesses&#39; trade and drive consumers away. The report also proposes to raise electricity prices and the gasoline tax significantly. However, middle-class families would be directly attacked by these measures, ”declared Nicolas Marceau.
The member recalls that the government promised to lower taxes, not to raise taxes, and this promise was not accompanied by a condition. He also points out that the tax burden of Quebecers has increased by more than $ 6 billion under Jean Charest, and nearly $ 1 billion already under the government of Philippe Couillard.
“We do not have confidence when the Liberals say they want to make changes to the tax system while keeping the overall burden unchanged; they are compulsive &quot;taxers&quot;! », Added Nicolas Marceau.
The Parti Québécois is open to debate
The spokesperson also affirmed that his political formation was open to debates on Quebec taxation. The principles guiding this opening are simple:
“The government wants a debate; we are debating, therefore, by presenting clear principles, for the benefit of the middle class, families, businesses and the economy of Quebec. We will not accept another Liberal QST hike. In terms of equity, increasing taxes in return for lowering taxes means asking more of the middle class and low-income households, while giving gifts to the rich, ”concluded Nicolas Marceau.
