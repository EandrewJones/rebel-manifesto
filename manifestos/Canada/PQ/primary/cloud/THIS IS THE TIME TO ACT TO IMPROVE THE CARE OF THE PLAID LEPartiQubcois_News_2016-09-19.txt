Quebec, September 19, 2016 - The member for Rimouski and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois pour les Seniors, Harold LeBel, is sorry to see the Liberal government trying to buy time by announcing a consultation instead of taking concrete steps to improve health care for seniors now.
“After cutting nearly a billion dollars in health care and services over the past two years, which has hurt seniors very badly, the Liberal government is announcing today that it will finally consult with groups and citizens, and seek solutions to repair the damage he himself has caused. It&#39;s the world upside down, ”said Harold LeBel.
“This maneuver to save time does not fool anyone. We ask the government to immediately restore the abolished and unfulfilled positions in CHSLDs and in home care, to stop the cuts and to reinvest to avoid other episodes in which the elderly are forced to eat powdered potatoes, or must wait several weeks, even months, to be able to take a bath, ”added the spokesperson.
“While last June, the members of the Committee on Health and Social Services, including the Liberal MP for Crémazie, Marie Montpetit, completed a mandate of initiative on the living conditions of people accommodated in CHSLDs. , the government is restarting the exercise. There is nothing to understand: between 2013 and 2016, the Commission heard from 36 groups in public hearings, received 38 briefs and visited facilities in four regions of Quebec. And that&#39;s without counting the many reports from the Québec Ombudsman which recommended very concrete actions to improve access to care for the elderly. Potential solutions, we have some; now is the time to act, ”concluded Harold LeBel.
