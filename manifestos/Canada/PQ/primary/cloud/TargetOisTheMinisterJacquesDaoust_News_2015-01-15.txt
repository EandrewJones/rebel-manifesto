Quebec - The member for Saint-Jérôme and official opposition critic for the economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, is worried about the consequences of the closure in Quebec, from all Target chain stores. He is keen to assure his support for the women and men who will soon lose their jobs.
“Everything must be done to help workers during this difficult period. Let us remember that since the Liberal Party came to power, Quebec has lost 35,900 full-time jobs! The government is continuing its inaction and has no economic policy or support for job creation to offer. He must wake up and put in place a real economic plan; that it stop reducing tax credits for companies that create jobs, and that it put in place a real strategy of support and creation of SMEs! », Claimed Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“After JACOB and Mexx, the difficulties of the retail sector continue in Quebec. The entire population is forced to question the future of the industry and that of its workers. However, one question is more urgent: what is the Minister of the Economy, Innovation and Exports, Jacques Daoust doing, while closures and job losses are piling up? What does he intend to do to support the retail trade? », Concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
