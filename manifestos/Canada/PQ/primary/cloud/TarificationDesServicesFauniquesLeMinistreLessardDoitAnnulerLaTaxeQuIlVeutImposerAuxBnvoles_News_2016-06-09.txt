Quebec - In the company of two speakers from the Saguenay basin organization, the member for Bonaventure and Parti Québécois spokesperson for forests, wildlife and parks, Sylvain Roy, and the member for Chicoutimi, Mireille Jean , urged the Liberal government to reverse the new pricing for wildlife services it wants to impose on voluntary organizations.
“The regulation proposed by the government constitutes an unprecedented attack on volunteering in Quebec. The new tariffs for wildlife permits make no distinction between a non-profit organization, an NPO, and an oil company that wishes, for example, to develop a spawning ground. NPOs will have to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars to do work that is complementary to that of the ministry. For example, it will cost $ 506 to be able to develop fish habitat, an amount that constitutes a large part of the annual budget of some organizations. This is unacceptable! », Denounced the deputy for Bonaventure.
“The volunteers who carry out wildlife development work on our waterways do so with heart, and for the benefit of the entire community. Why is the government so keen to kill initiatives taken by citizens in our regions? Are the Liberals not aware of the additional expense that the government would have to pay for the full cost of the work currently being done by volunteers? The Minister must cancel these rates for volunteers! », Added Mireille Jean.
