Quebec, November 11, 2016 - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, this morning held a press briefing in the National Assembly and then an interpellation to denounce, once in addition, the meteoric increase in taxes that farmers will suffer as a result of the changes made by the Liberal government to the farm property tax credit program. Several agricultural producers, as well as representatives of the Union des producteurs agricoles (UPA) and the Federation of Quebec Municipalities (FQM), were present in support of the official opposition&#39;s approach.
“The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pierre Paradis, continues to completely ignore farmers and their anger. Will he hear the 400 of them who appeared in front of his constituency office this morning with my colleague Alain Therrien? He would have an advantage! He would thus become aware of their reality, ”declared André Villeneuve.
The spokesperson recalls that 83% of farmers will see their property tax bill increase by 30% to 40% on average. “It is simply unacceptable and catastrophic. The Liberal government is taking thousands of dollars out of their pockets. Thousands of dollars that they don&#39;t necessarily have, ”he continued.
“Today, Pierre Paradis has the opportunity to demonstrate that he is not totally disconnected from the reality of our producers. Will he grab it? If he is really concerned about their fate, he must imperatively respond to the demand of farmers and municipalities for the entry into force of the new version of the agricultural property tax credit program, scheduled for January 1, to be postponed. . What the FQM and the farmers are asking for is to sit down with the minister in order to find a lasting solution. It is the decision which is essential, the only acceptable way which is offered to resolve the impasse ”, concluded André Villeneuve.
