Quebec - As the Quebec microbrewery sector continues its strong expansion, and the talent of their artisans is increasingly recognized around the world, one concern remained: there was concern about an increase in the specific tax imposed on the purchase of their products, as recommended by the Godbout report. However, this morning, at the insistence of the Parti Québécois, the Liberal government made a firm commitment not to increase this tax.
We will recall that the report of the Québec Taxation Review Commission recommended increasing the specific tax for microbreweries. “It was just foolish to consider raising this tax. The microbrewery sector in Quebec has 130 businesses and some 3,800 direct jobs. Often, they were created by young entrepreneurs who return or come to settle in the regions in order to actively contribute to their development. Quebec needs them; they energize and enhance our regions, in addition to making us proud around the world, ”insisted Gaétan Lelièvre, Parti Québécois spokesperson for regional development and for the Treasury Board.
“On the part of a government, it was totally irresponsible to leave any doubt about a possible tax hike for these companies in particular. Across Quebec, microbrewers have suspended their investments while waiting to see what the Liberals do. We could easily understand these very legitimate fears, and our party had to defend the interests of these companies. That the government has finally made a commitment not to increase the tax is good news, ”added the MP.
He also recalled that it was under the impetus of a Parti Québécois government that the microbrewery sector experienced a tremendous boom, from 1996, to become, today, one of the flagships. Quebec know-how. “The products of our microbrewers regularly win prestigious awards at international brewing competitions. They are among the best in the world. The government must continue to provide them with all the necessary support, ”concluded Gaétan Lelièvre.
