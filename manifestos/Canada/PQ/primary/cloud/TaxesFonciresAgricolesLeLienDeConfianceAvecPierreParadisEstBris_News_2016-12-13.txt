Quebec City, December 13, 2016 - The Parti Québécois agriculture spokesperson, André Villeneuve, has once again noted that the bond of trust between farmers and Minister Pierre Paradis has been broken. In fact, on Monday, the Union des producteurs agricoles (UPA) put the Quebec government on notice because of the planned changes to the agricultural property tax credit program.
“When the farmers have come to the point of putting the government on notice, it shows the depth of their disagreement. For months, we have been screaming, alongside farmers, to denounce the impacts of the changes made to the property tax program by the Liberal government. Pierre Paradis&#39; only response was to make fun of farmers by calling them liars who couldn&#39;t count. The farce has gone on long enough, ”declared André Villeneuve.
UPA calculations, based on MAPAQ figures, show that among the 83% of farmers who will suffer a tax increase, many will have to pay thousands of dollars more, for an average increase ranging from 30% to 40 %. This analysis was confirmed by an independent study by the firm Forest Lavoie, commissioned by the Coop fédérée.
“Minister Paradis misled farmers. In the tax file, as in many others, he lost the confidence of the agricultural community. The Prime Minister must take note of this and do what is necessary: remove Pierre Paradis from his functions, ”concluded the deputy.
