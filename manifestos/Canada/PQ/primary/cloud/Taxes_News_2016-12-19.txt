Quebec, December 19, 2016 - After the Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, suggested using an expert to measure the impact of his reform of the agricultural property tax credit program, the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in the area of agriculture, André Villeneuve reacted by proposing that the appointment of the said expert be the result of a joint recommendation from the Union des producteurs agricoles (UPA) and the government.
“The Liberal government broke the bond of trust that united farmers, even calling them liars. The minister&#39;s announcement this week is more a matter of panic than real goodwill, ”said André Villeneuve.
Remember that the figures put forward by the UPA - according to which 83% of farmers will suffer a tax increase of 30% to 40% on average - were confirmed by a study by the firm Forest Lavoie, commissioned by the Coop fédérée. “The minister no longer has any credibility; we maintain that he must resign. However, if the government wishes to appoint an expert to measure the impact of this bad reform on the ground, the least thing is for this expert to be recognized by farmers, ”concluded the MP for Berthier.
