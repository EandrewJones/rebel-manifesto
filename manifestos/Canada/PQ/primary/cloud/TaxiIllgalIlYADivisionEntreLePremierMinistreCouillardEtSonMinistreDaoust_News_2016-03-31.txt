Quebec - MP Martine Ouellet, spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of transport, maritime strategy, transport electrification and digital strategy, denounces the interference of Prime Minister Couillard, which prevents his Minister of Transport, Jacques Daoust , to act to counter the illegal taxi by blocking the tabling of its bill.
“After Robert Poëti, it is now Jacques Daoust&#39;s turn to come up against the interference of Prime Minister Philippe Couillard in the illegal taxi file. The two transport ministers, Mr. Poëti in the fall of 2014 and Mr. Daoust this winter, declared in a parliamentary committee that UberX was carrying out illegal transport. During Uber&#39;s appearance last February, Minister Daoust wondered how the company could be &quot;happy to have abused the system 450,000 times in a month&quot;. It is only Prime Minister Couillard who protects the foreign multinational by endorsing the illegal taxi. Why does the Prime Minister constantly meddle in favor of Uber, even going against the will of his own ministers? Why does Mr. Couillard tolerate the illegality of UberX, to the detriment of 20,000 Quebec workers? Asked the member for Vachon.
While the Prime Minister&#39;s Office filibusters, the reality on the ground continues to deteriorate. Just last week, a judge refused to hand over their vehicle to repeat offenders, considering that the deposit currently required was insufficient to counter the illegal taxi.
“The Prime Minister is now solely responsible for the disruptions that we know. He has been letting the situation rot for several months now. It is high time that Philippe Couillard let his Minister of Transport do his job and apply the law. The government can act now, whether by injunction, as in Calgary, or by calling our Bill 593 to fight illegal taxis, tabled on February 18. We are also offering our full cooperation for the study of a bill that would modernize the law on taxis, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
