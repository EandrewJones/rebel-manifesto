Quebec - MNA for Taillon, Marie Malavoy, MNA for Jonquière, Sylvain Gaudreault, MNA for Prévost, Gilles Robert, and MNA for Sainte-Marie-Saint-Jacques, Martin Lemay, are completely overwhelmed by the Liberal government&#39;s refusal to allow the Committee on Culture and Education to look into the teaching of history.
&quot;This is a fine demonstration of indifference, even disinterest on the part of the liberals in regard to the teaching of this subject, however so important in the school curriculum&quot;, affirmed at the outset of game the official opposition spokesperson for elementary and secondary education, Sylvain Gaudreault.
“Despite the setbacks observed by various researchers in the teaching of history, the Liberal government refuses to face the truth. The Parti Québécois has proposed to the Committee on Culture and Education to consider, through a mandate of initiative, the teaching of history in our schools and its place in teacher training. All we got was an outright refusal! “, Said the spokesperson for higher education, Marie Malavoy.
“What does the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports think of this decision? The Liberal MPs present at the working session, the MP for Lévis, Gilles Lehouillier, the MP for Vanier, Patrick Huot, the MP for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, the MP for Mille-Îles, Francine Charbonneau, and the MP for Charlesbourg, Michel Pigeon, were they on a mission ordered from Minister Line Beauchamp? It&#39;s up to them to explain! Exclaimed the member for Prévost.
The vice-president of the commission, Martin Lemay, reiterated his deep concern about the decline in the teaching of national history. “What explains our nation&#39;s presence in North America must be taught to young people. I can hardly explain my disappointment, once again, with this government, ”concluded Martin Lemay.
