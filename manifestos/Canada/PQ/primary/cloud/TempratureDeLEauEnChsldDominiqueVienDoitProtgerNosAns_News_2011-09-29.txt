Quebec- The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for seniors, Carole Poirier, wishes to remind the Minister responsible for Social Services, Dominique Vien, that the safety of seniors is paramount and that, in this regard, meaning, a clear message must be heard by the CHSLDs in Quebec regarding the water temperature.
“Despite two deaths from burns at the CHSLD du Manoir-de-l&#39;Ouest-de-l&#39;Île in Montreal, the Minister has still not issued a directive. Even after a first report from the coroner stipulating that it was the temperature of the water that was in question and that the situation had to be remedied quickly, no follow-up was carried out. How many deaths does it take for the minister to finally settle this file? », Asked Carole Poirier.
“Rather than contradict the Ombudsperson, who carried out a very rigorous analysis of the file and found that there was a serious problem, the Minister must act without delay to ensure that such a situation never happens again. We cannot allow our elders to risk burning themselves dangerously, sometimes to the point of death, while taking their bath. A 40-degree ceiling must be imposed, as recommended by the Ombudsperson and the coroner, ”said Carole Poirier.
The Ombudsperson, both in her annual report and during this morning&#39;s press conference, was categorical:
“The Minister must quickly understand what the Ombudsperson&#39;s request consists of and take action,” concluded Carole Poirier.
