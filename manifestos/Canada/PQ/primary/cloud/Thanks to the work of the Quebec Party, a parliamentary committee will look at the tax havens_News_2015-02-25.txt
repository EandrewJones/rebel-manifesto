Quebec - Thanks to the work of Rousseau&#39;s member of parliament and spokesman for the official opposition on finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, the Public Finance Commission has agreed to take an initiative mandate on the phenomenon of tax havens, which allow Quebec citizens and businesses to resort to tax evasion.
“Tax evasion is a serious and deeply unfair phenomenon for honest Quebecers who pay their taxes. A parliamentary committee will therefore hear all the parties concerned, in particular the organizations responsible for compliance with our laws, the banks, as well as experts in taxation and accounting in order to measure the extent of the phenomenon and identify solutions to combat the problem. tax evasion, ”said Nicolas Marceau.
Remember that the Parti Québécois proposed this mandate following the European financial scandals which demonstrated that hundreds of Quebecers use accounts in Switzerland. “Avoiding taxes by resorting to tax havens is a dishonest process that costs the Quebec treasury dearly. Those who practice tax evasion benefit from all our services, but do not contribute like other citizens; this situation must end. Quebeckers want that to change, ”concluded the member for Rousseau.
