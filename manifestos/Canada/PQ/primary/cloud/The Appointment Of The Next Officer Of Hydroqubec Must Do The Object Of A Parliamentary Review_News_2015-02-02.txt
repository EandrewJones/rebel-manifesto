Québec, January 30, 2015 - Following the announcement of the upcoming departure of Thierry Vandal, CEO of Hydro-Québec, the member for Marie-Victorin and official opposition spokesperson for energy, Bernard Drainville, moved that the appointment of the next head of the Crown corporation be subject to parliamentary review.
“When the government has identified a candidate, the latter should be heard by a parliamentary committee in order to support his candidacy and answer questions from elected officials, before the adoption of the decree of appointment by the government. The CEO of Hydro-Québec must continue to report to the government and act in accordance with its major orientations. Choices such as phasing out nuclear power or electrifying transport must remain the prerogative of the Council of Ministers. On the other hand, the appointment process needs to be improved. The government must be ready to submit the qualifications and skills of the prospective candidate to parliamentarians for scrutiny, and agree to take the commission&#39;s report into consideration before the appointment is confirmed, ”said Bernard Drainville.
The deputy also underlined the long service of Thierry Vandal and wished him good success for the rest of his career.
