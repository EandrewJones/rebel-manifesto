Quebec - Reacting to the tabling by the Coalition futur Quebec (CAQ) of a bill to expand the powers of the Auditor General of Quebec, the Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau, recalled today He announced in the 2013-2014 budget that the Auditor General will henceforth be able to carry out a value-for-money audit in government enterprises and their subsidiaries at his discretion. “It is fundamental to us that agencies that report to the state are more fully accountable for their operations. From the budget, we took action to expand the powers of the Auditor General, ”said the Minister.
“I am therefore surprised by the announcement of the CAQ, which is today asking the government to act on this front, whereas the announcement was made more than two months ago. Mr. Legault&#39;s statements are all the more surprising given that his political party voted against the adoption of the budget, ”he added.
The Minister said he was surprised that Bill 193 of the CAQ enshrines the status quo by requiring the Auditor General to obtain the authorization of the board of directors or the management of the government enterprise before undertaking a verification. “Since section 28 of the Auditor General Act already provides for this possibility, Bill 193 would not change the situation. In addition, the government intends to broaden the powers of the Auditor General so that he can undertake an audit at his discretion, without having previously obtained authorization from the government enterprise, ”he stressed.
He concluded by recalling that an omnibus bill will be tabled during the spring session in order to implement the measures of the 2013-2014 budget.
