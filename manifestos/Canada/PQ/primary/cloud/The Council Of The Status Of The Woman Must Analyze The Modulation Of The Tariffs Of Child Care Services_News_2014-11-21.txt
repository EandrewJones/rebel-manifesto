Quebec - The Member for Taschereau and House Leader of the Official Opposition, Agnès Maltais, today took advantage of the inquiry concerning childcare services to demand from the government an opinion from the Council on the Status of Women (CSF) on the subject liberal modulation of tariffs.
“In Quebec, we decided to set up a system that gave women a choice, that allowed them to return to the job market. The modulation of the tariffs makes us go back in time. It is very disturbing; it will encourage a return to moonlighting, like 30 years ago, before we set up the network. Does the Minister know the impact modulation will have on women&#39;s autonomy? On their ability to access or return to the labor market? Has it assessed the impact on family-work-study balance? All these questions could be analyzed by the CSF, ”said Agnès Maltais.
