Québec, July 18, 2014 - The member for Saint-Jérôme and official opposition critic for the economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, has expressed concern about the figures published by the Institut de la statistique du Québec this morning, which indicate a drop in economic activity and GDP in April.
“The Liberals had promised that their mere coming to power would grow the economy. However, we saw this morning that the effect of their coming to power is a drop in GDP and economic activity, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
Figures released this morning show that Quebec&#39;s GDP fell in April, after increases in January, February and March. Twelve of the 20 major sectors of Quebec economic activity experienced a decline in April, the most significant being in the production of goods.
&quot;While he illustrated his government&#39;s improvisation by making contradictory statements about the continuation of the Romaine project, earlier this week, the Prime Minister does he realize that the absence of economic and industrial policy leads Quebec in an impasse and towards collective impoverishment? », Asked the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of economy.
The Parti Québécois government launched the Priorité emploi economic policy on October 7, 2013 and it was producing results.
“The Liberal government has curbed this momentum by putting this policy aside for purely partisan purposes. When will Quebec return to an economic policy worthy of the name? Instead of laissez-faire and improvisation, the government must lead the state to act as an agent of stimulus for economic activity and the enrichment of the community, as is the case in many countries. », Concluded the member for Saint? Jérôme.
