Quebec - The member for Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, denounces the decision of the Prime Minister, who confirmed this morning that his government will put the ax in the youth forums of Quebec. In response to his question, Philippe Couillard indeed refused to guarantee that the youth forums will survive.
“The person in charge of youth issues, Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, does not stand up for young people. Where was he when we vigorously denounced the change in mission of carrefours jeunesse emploi? Where is it in the youth forums file? The only time in several weeks that he speaks about young people is to announce the closure of youth forums. In addition, he does that in the middle of question period, during a gag order. One would expect a prime minister to have more respect for employees and directors. Why did he wait three weeks before informing them of his decision? Asked Dave Turcotte.
“By allowing young people to participate concretely in the reflections and decisions that affect them, youth forums are a unique model that we are envied elsewhere in the world. Through the Regional Youth Investment Fund, they also provide assistance to thousands of youth projects. Unfortunately, by imposing the gag order on Bill 28, we are sacrificing several important consultation tools in all regions of Quebec, especially youth forums, ”he added.
“In addition to not having paid the amounts planned for last year, the Liberal government neglected to renew the mandates of the forums, as well as their budgets for this year. As a result, several of them had to lay off members of their staff, or even put the key in the door. However, these organizations are essential for the youth and the regions of Quebec; axing it is simply unacceptable. I will continue the fight with them, ”concluded Dave Turcotte.
