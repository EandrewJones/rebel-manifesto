Québec, August 24, 2016 - The member for Jonquière and leader of the official opposition, Sylvain Gaudreault, asks the Prime Minister to call his Minister of Health and Social Services, Gaétan Barrette, to order, who made comments unacceptable about the tragic events of Metropolis.
“I am speechless, outraged by the unimaginable remarks made by the Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette. It is unacceptable that an elected member of the National Assembly and minister, moreover, could have made a link between a political position, which is completely legitimate and democratic, and the attack on Metropolis, ”declared Sylvain Gaudreault.
&quot;And, as if that were not enough, the minister asks the deputies to&quot; measure &quot;their speech. What speech is he talking about? Sovereignist discourse? Are we to understand from the minister that he wants to limit the freedom of expression of sovereignist deputies in this way? The Minister of Health, who is already reviewing the scope of his remarks, as he does too often, should apply his advice to himself and simply think before speaking, ”continued the MP for Jonquière.
The leader of the official opposition also recalls that it is everyone&#39;s duty to denounce bullying, intolerance and racism, in all their forms, including when they come out against the convictions shared by millions. of Quebeckers about the political future of their nation.
&quot;On behalf of the members of the official opposition, of all Quebeckers, I ask the Prime Minister to denounce the words of his minister and to formally dissociate himself from them,&quot; concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
