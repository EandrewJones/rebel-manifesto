Québec, October 5, 2016 - Nicolas Marceau, the member for Rousseau, parliamentary leader of the official opposition and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of finance and revenue, as well as his colleague MP for Rosemont and spokesperson for of public health and prevention, Jean-François Lisée, ask that the Auditor General of Quebec examine the operation of video lottery terminals (VLTs) by Loto-Québec, in particular their distribution and compliance with the rules applicable to the Crown corporation in this regard.
“We know that VLTs, in some cases, are real life-breaking machines. However, since the Minister of Finance admitted to juggling with the idea of blowing up the limit of 5 devices per establishment, the disturbing facts accumulate. In fact, the more we learn about the distribution of VLTs in Quebec, the more we see that it is the Wild West, the most total confusion. Among other things, vulnerable regions, villages and neighborhoods find themselves with more VLT than what is allowed by Loto-Québec, ”Nicolas Marceau immediately reported.
“The Crown corporation has established socio-economic criteria for the distribution of VLTs, but they are not met. How to explain, indeed, that there are 75 VLTs in 8 bars in Pont-Viau? How can we explain that in Montreal East, Ville Marie or Richelieu, we ignore the limit of 2 devices per 100 inhabitants? There is definitely something to investigate for the Auditor General, ”continued Jean-François Lisée.
MEPs recall that the consequences of VLT can be dramatic. “Pathological gambling is a real public health problem. Either Loto-Québec is lying to the minister about the operation of VLTs, or the minister is blindly. We cannot continue to install VLTs where people are most at risk of developing an addiction to what some consider electronic crack. The Auditor General must shed light on this issue, ”they concluded.
