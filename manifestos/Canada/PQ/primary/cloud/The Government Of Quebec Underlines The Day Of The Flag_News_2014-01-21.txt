Quebec - The Minister of Justice and Minister responsible for the application of the Act respecting the flag and emblems of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, participated today in the ceremony marking Flag Day, in the presence of several dignitaries and parliamentarians.
“There is no stronger symbol for a nation than its flag. This flag belongs to all Quebecers, regardless of our origins, our beliefs, our political choices. It brings us together, ”said Minister Bertrand St-Arnaud.
It was at 3:00 pm precisely at the Parliament Building that the minister paid tribute to the Quebec flag, as is tradition. All over Quebec, municipalities have also been invited to mark Flag Day.
“Since 1948, this flag has accompanied us in all stages of our national development, be it social, cultural, economic and democratic. It bears witness to our history but it also evokes the present and it celebrates the future. Let us be proud of our flag and of all that it represents, ”added Minister Bertrand St-Arnaud.
On January 21, 1948, at 3 p.m., the fleur-de-lis flag was hoisted for the first time atop the central tower of the Parliament Building, replacing the British flag, the Union Jack. That day, by decree, Quebec granted it the status of official flag. For more information, the public is invited to consult the flag&#39;s website at the following address: www.d Drapeau.gouv.qc.ca.
