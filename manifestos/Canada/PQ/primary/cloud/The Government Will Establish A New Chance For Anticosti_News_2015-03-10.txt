Quebec - The member for Marie-Victorin and official opposition critic for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, asks the government to establish a new timetable for oil exploration on the island of Anticosti, so that Quebecers can know its potential to be able to decide what they want to do with it.
During the parliamentary commission on Bill 28, we learned that the 2014 exploration program on Anticosti was not respected. The government left the project in doubt even before the last election and did not provide the support necessary to achieve the program&#39;s objectives, so that the project has already fallen a year behind schedule.
“By cutting exploration tax credits by 20%, the Liberal government has scared investors away. He must put an end to the uncertainty surrounding the project and define a new timetable for Anticosti. Quebecers have the right to know the oil potential of the island; they can then decide what they want to do with it, ”said Bernard Drainville.
Actions to take back our rights
Remember that the Parti Québécois government has recovered the rights of Quebeckers in the Anticosti territory, rights that had been ceded for a pittance by the Liberal government of Jean Charest.
The exploratory stage consisted of validating the commercial potential. To this end, work was to be carried out in the summer of 2014, in order to allow the government to make informed decisions on the next steps, in particular on the environmental impact analysis process.
Philippe Couillard does nothing for the wealth of Quebecers
“After coming to power, the Liberal government put Anticosti and shale gas in the same boat. However, a government with such a miserable economic record does not have the means to deprive Quebecers of their right to know if there is oil potential on Anticosti Island, ”added the member for Marie- Victorin.
