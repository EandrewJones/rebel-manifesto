Quebec - The MP for Charlevoix and Leader of the Official Opposition, Pauline Marois, is pleased to welcome back the MP for Groulx, René Gauvreau, to the Parti Québécois caucus.
“I am delighted to be able to work again with the member for Groulx within the Parti Québécois. Its commitment, particularly in the youth protection file, is an asset for our political party, ”she said.
The checks carried out did not establish any link between the deputy for Groulx and the accusations against his former political attaché. René Gauvreau will end his term, but will not be a candidate in the next election.
