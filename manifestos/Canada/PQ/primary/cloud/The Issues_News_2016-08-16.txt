Quebec, August 16, 2016 - The member for Sanguinet and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, calls for the immediate splitting of Bill 106, An Act respecting the implementation of the Policy energy 2030 and amending various legislative provisions.
“It is contradictory to include a bill on hydrocarbons in a bill on Quebec&#39;s transition to clean energies, the very essence of Bill 106. It is essential to separate the two issues. Indeed, the issue of hydrocarbons is particularly complex and deserves a debate in itself, independently of all the other measures contained in Bill 106 ”, explained the member for Sanguinet.
“Moreover, in a bill on hydrocarbons, it would have been essential to find the criteria on which the government bases itself to determine whether, yes or not, a project can go ahead, but it is not the case. For companies in the hydrocarbon sector, as for the municipalities and citizens concerned, there is total uncertainty; what criteria will the government use to accept or reject a project? “, Also questioned Alain Therrien.
“That said, during the consultations to come, we will try to obtain clarification on many issues. We also believe that it is essential that the government broaden the consultations and agree to invite all interested groups, businesses, municipalities and citizens, ”said the spokesperson.
