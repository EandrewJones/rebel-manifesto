Quebec - The member for Sanguinet and official opposition critic for work and pensions, Alain Therrien, believes that the Liberal government must devote all its energy to creating jobs in Quebec and not lock up only in a logic of austerity.
“The government must not forget its duty to stimulate job creation in all regions of Quebec. The austerity into which he wants to plunge us is a major risk in this regard, ”said Alain Therrien.
The latest statistics, released today, indicate that rigorous work needs to be done. The economic policy Priority employment of the Marois government also contained several clear orientations on the economic development of Quebec.
“We still do not know what the government intends to do with the Priority Jobs economic policy implemented by the Parti Québécois. We learned this morning that the gazelle program is in jeopardy. This program is intended to support 300 SMEs, among the best and most promising, in order to promote job creation in all regions of Quebec, ”added Alain Therrien.
The Liberal government must quickly indicate what it plans to cut from economic development programs.
“We have only heard about cuts since this government came to power. We now hope he talks to us about jobs and economic development. Our expectation is high for the next budget; the requests that we formulate must be taken into account, ”concluded the member for Sanguinet.
