Quebec– Pierre Karl Péladeau, MP for Saint-Jean and spokesperson for the economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, MP for Saint-Jean and spokesperson for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, as well as the member for Rousseau and critic for finance and income, Nicolas Marceau, deplore that full-time employment continues to decline in Quebec under the Liberals, while it increased in the rest of Canada.
“Workers and their families face numerous closures of businesses and retail establishments as the government embraces the liberal technique of carelessness. As in many sectors of the State, measures to stimulate employment are victims of Liberal-Caquist austerity, ”said Dave Turcotte.
“Since the Liberal government came to power, 12,800 full-time jobs have been lost. Regions, families, SMEs: with the liberal effect, they are all the losers. Entrepreneurs lose confidence, which slows down investment and the creation of full-time jobs. When will the government wake up? We need a real economic development policy, ”added Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“Again this week, the Royal Bank confirmed that the Couillard government&#39;s austerity is slowing down the Quebec economy and job growth. Not only is the government cutting everywhere, it is also opening the door wide to a further increase in the QST. It is the liberal method at its best: to promise, during an election campaign, not to increase the tax burden of Quebecers, but to govern by increasing it, ”concluded Nicolas Marceau.
