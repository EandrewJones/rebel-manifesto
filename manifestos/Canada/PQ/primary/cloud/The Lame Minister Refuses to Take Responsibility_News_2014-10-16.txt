Québec, October 16, 2014 - The member for Sanguinet and official opposition spokesperson for the Conseil du trésor, Alain Therrien, asks the president of the Conseil du trésor, Martin Coiteux, to take the problems at the Center universitaire de McGill Health (MUHC). We learned today, in La Presse, that the former director of the MUHC, Arthur Porter, drew up “minimalist plans”, at the origin of the disputes between the center and the consortium responsible for its construction.
Last May, we were informed that the consortium was asking for an additional $ 200 million for the construction of the MUHC. “Whenever the Parti Québécois asked him about this, Minister Martin Coiteux was not overly worried about potential cost overruns. However, after the arrest of Arthur Porter, SNC-Lavalin executives and project managers, the Liberal government should have carried out full checks before taking possession, but it let things go, ”lamented Alain Therrien.
The MP pointed out that the MUHC&#39;s public-private partnership (PPP) project is once again a bad choice for Quebecers. “Philippe Couillard, at the time Minister of Health, told us that with the PPP formula, cost overruns would be borne by the private sector. How does he explain today that they are being claimed from Quebec taxpayers? He then appointed his friend Arthur Porter as the head of the MUHC. We know what happens next, and the report released today tells us that it is unfortunately not over, ”laments the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois.
“Did the government start payments to the consortium despite all the litigation? And how much, by the way, will the MUHC cost? The Liberals announced to us a $ 1.1 billion project in 2004, whereas today it is estimated at at least $ 2.8 billion, ”concluded Alain Therrien.
