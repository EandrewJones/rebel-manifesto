Quebec - The deputy for Bonaventure and official opposition spokesperson for forests, Sylvain Roy, asks the Minister of Forests, Wildlife and Parks, Laurent Lessard, to confirm the sum of 225 million in investments for the forest, announced with great fanfare last spring by Prime Minister Philippe Couillard.
“New day, new broken Liberal promise. If it turns out, this breach of commitment will cause direct job losses in forest regions. This is scandalous, especially since the planned increase in budgets was the direct result of the increase in royalties paid by the industry. What is Minister Laurent Lessard waiting for to defend the forest environment? Plant closures are piling up, with more than 50,000 full-time job losses since April. For the first time in a long time, the Minister of Finance forecasts a drop in employment in Quebec. The government must act, deploy a real economic policy, and this will notably involve forest workers, ”said Sylvain Roy.
The deputy recalled that the forestry sector has been severely affected since the Liberals took office; factories have in fact stopped their production in almost all regions, in particular those of the Côte-Nord, Bas-Saint-Laurent, Charlevoix, Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Saguenay – Lac-Saint-Jean, &#39;Estrie and Mauricie. It should also be noted that the Liberal record is disastrous for the forestry sector: between 2003 and 2012, there were 20,000 direct job losses and 300 plant closures.
“The government cannot even maintain the existing jobs. By disinvesting in silvicultural work, the future of Quebec&#39;s forests is in jeopardy. This broken promise adds to the Prime Minister&#39;s dashboard. Laurent Lessard must confirm that the amount of 225 million will be preserved, instead of letting concern and uncertainty hang over the regions, ”Sylvain Roy concluded.
