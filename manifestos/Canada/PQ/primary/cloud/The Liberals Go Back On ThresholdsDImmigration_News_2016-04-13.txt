Quebec - The leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, and the spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of immigration and cultural communities, Maka Kotto, finally note the decline of the liberal Prime Minister Philippe Couillard on the increase of immigration thresholds.
“We are attending the festival of contradiction. In Philippe Couillard&#39;s assessment of his government, he reiterated his intention to raise the immigration thresholds to 60,000. To explain his decision, he said that Quebec needed to increase its working population. But his immigration minister, Kathleen Weil, said the opposite. The Prime Minister, finally realizing the obvious, backed down. While we have been telling him for weeks that raising the thresholds was not reasonable, because of our capacity for integration, he finally heard reason this morning, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
The members of the Parti Québécois recall that this was not the first time that the Prime Minister has affirmed his desire to increase the thresholds to 60,000. He did so in June 2015, during a convention, and he did so. reiterated when tabling the new policy on immigration, participation and inclusion. We can even read, in this policy, that “from a level of 60,000 immigrants admitted annually, Quebec would avoid a decline in its working-age population”.
“The question of integration is primordial and sensitive, in terms of work and that of francization, in particular. We have a duty to take proper care of those who are already here and to whom the Liberal government is struggling to provide tangible answers in terms of francization, employment and recognition of prior learning; of those who made the choice of Quebec and who must integrate as best as possible into our society. Even though her policy says the opposite, the minister must specify her intentions as to the thresholds to be reached, ”added Maka Kotto.
