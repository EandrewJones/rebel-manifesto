Quebec - The member for Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, denounces the insensitivity of the Liberal government, which refused to support a motion asking it to commit to maintaining youth forums and their funding.
“After he refused to reassure the architects of the youth forums, after he dodged my questions yesterday, we are finally seeing reality, since the Liberal government rejected our motion. I ask him to stop harboring uncertainty in this matter once and for all. When will he set the record straight for young people in forums, who are concretely involved in their community to change things? Asked Dave Turcotte.
The motion defeated by the Liberals reads as follows:
“That the National Assembly confirm the importance of youth forums, real institutions for learning citizenship, working, since their creation, to provide a place of engagement for young people in Quebec;
That it affirms their essential character for regional development, allowing all young people in Quebec to contribute to the development of their society;
That the National Assembly ask the government to commit to maintaining the youth forums and their funding. &quot;
“Youth forums are of capital importance in terms of regional development and the civic involvement of young people in public life. It is deplorable that the government has decided to abolish them, and insulting that it has not said a word to the main stakeholders, ”concluded Dave Turcotte.
