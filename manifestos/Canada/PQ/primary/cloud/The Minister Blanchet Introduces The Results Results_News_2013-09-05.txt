Quebec - The Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Yves-François Blanchet, announces that the results of analysis of the sediments collected around the water intakes of the Chaudière River are now available on the MDDEFP website.
“As promised, we are ensuring that the population has access to the most up-to-date data concerning the contamination of sites affected by the events in Lac-Mégantic. We will continue to act with rigor, transparency and efficiency in the dissemination of analysis results, in step with the work carried out in the field ”, underlined the Minister.
The sediments collected near the Sainte-Marie and Lévis (Saint-Rédempteur) water intakes do not show any contamination by petroleum hydrocarbons. The sediments collected near the Saint-Georges water intake show very low concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons (C10-C50), at distances of more than 125 meters upstream from the Sartigan dam. These concentrations are not considered to be of concern for the ecosystem.
At the three water intakes, the metal concentrations in the sediments sampled are similar to the historical data recorded in the Chaudière River.
It should be remembered that only the results of the Department&#39;s analyzes are published on its website. Ministerial data is available at the following address: http: //www.mddefp.gouv.qc.ca/lac-megantic/.
