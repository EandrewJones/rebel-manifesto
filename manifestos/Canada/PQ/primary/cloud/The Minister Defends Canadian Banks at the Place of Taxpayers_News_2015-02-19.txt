Quebec - Rousseau MP and official opposition finance and income spokesman Nicolas Marceau deplores the fact that Finance Minister Carlos Leitão has defended banks that integrate tax havens into their corporate structure, instead of supporting Quebec taxpayers who pay for tax evasion.
“Virtually all Canadian banks have subsidiaries in several tax havens. Quebecers are asking questions, and with good reason. Why do you need so many subsidiaries in tax havens where the tax rate is practically zero? Unfortunately, the Minister of Finance did not defend the taxpayers in the National Assembly when I questioned him on this subject today; he preferred to take the side of the Canadian banks, ”declared Nicolas Marceau.
“The Minister and the Prime Minister will agree that tax evasion is a serious and above all unfair phenomenon for honest Quebeckers who pay their taxes. What is more, the rich who practice it benefit from an amnesty program, and the complicit banks benefit, in effect, from permanent impunity. No one is penalized, therefore. Quebecers want that to change! », Concluded the deputy.
Let us recall that last week, the Parti Québécois asked the Committee on Public Finance to carry out a mandate of initiative on tax evasion practiced by Quebeckers and banks. The Commission will meet shortly to determine whether it accepts this mandate.
