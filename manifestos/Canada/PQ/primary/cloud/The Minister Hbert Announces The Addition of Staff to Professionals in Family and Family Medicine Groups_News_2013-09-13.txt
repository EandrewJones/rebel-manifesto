“I am happy that FMGs in the region can benefit from the addition of health professionals such as nutritionists, social workers or even kinesiologists. In addition to supporting medical practice in FMGs, this will improve the accessibility and continuity of medical care and services for patients, in particular those suffering from chronic diseases, ”explained Minister Réjean Hébert.
“Consolidating the FMG network is one of our government&#39;s priority actions to build a strong and accessible first line. We are committed to carrying out a series of measures in this direction, and the allocation of new resources for the best performing FMGs is one of them, ”he added.
It should be noted that this addition of professionals is determined according to the performance of the FMGs, according to various criteria, including respect and renewal of their contractual agreement, the achievement of their target of clientele registrations, as well as their service offer in unfavorable hours (evenings and weekends) in relation to the number of patients registered.
Nationally, 181.5 additional FTEs will be distributed among 60 FMGs, for an average of 3 FTE each. This addition represents an annual investment of $ 13.6 million.
