Quebec - The Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau, reacted favorably today to the results of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec for the year 2012 made public this morning. “The Caisse&#39;s results are satisfactory. They meet the long-term needs of depositors, ”said the Minister.
Mr. Marceau emphasized the growth in the Caisse&#39;s total assets in Quebec, which now stands at $ 47.1 billion, an increase of nearly $ 6 billion compared to the previous year. “During 2012, the Caisse notably made investments in companies that are the pride of Quebecers, such as CGI ($ 1 billion), Laurentian Bank ($ 100 million), Innergex (98 , $ 9 M), Garda ($ 62.5 M) and CAE ($ 50 M) ”, underlined the Minister.
In addition, he was delighted with the investments made by the Caisse last year, in partnership with the Desjardins Group, in more than sixty small and medium-sized businesses in all regions of Quebec. He recalled that the Caisse had increased its envelope of funds for small businesses in Quebec by $ 150 million. It now stands at $ 200 million.
“The performance obtained by the Caisse in 2012 clearly shows that the search for optimal performance and economic development, far from being irreconcilable, go hand in hand,” concluded the Minister.
