Quebec - The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, today tabled in the National Assembly the report on the implementation of the Law amending the Code of Civil Procedure to prevent misuse courts and promote respect for freedom of expression and citizen participation in public debates.
This report reveals that the use of gag orders is not the subject of a widespread practice in Quebec, as a small number of real gag orders have been identified. That said, the report concludes that the new provisions put in place in 2009 provide a more effective framework for situations of abuse of process. Indeed, these provisions grant broad powers to the courts, providing them with a wide range of possibilities to sanction abuse at any stage of the proceedings.

Thus, according to the provisions of Bill 28, proof of intention would no longer be necessary to find an abuse of process. In addition, in order to reduce legal delays, simpler procedures are proposed there for presenting or contesting a request for abuse of process.
“The conclusions of this report demonstrate the effectiveness of the measures put in place to counter gag orders, which can infringe citizens in their fundamental rights and limit their access to fair justice. The new Code of Civil Procedure should also enable us to strengthen our actions in this area, for civil justice at the service of our fellow citizens, simpler, more efficient, faster and less expensive civil justice, ”concluded the Minister of Justice.
