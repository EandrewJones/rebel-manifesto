Quebec - The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, announces the adoption, as of today, of Bill 51 amending the Territorial Division Act, in order to replace the name of the judicial district of Hull by that of Gatineau.
“In September 2012, during the congress of the Association of provincial lawyers, I was made aware of this request made many times by the Barreau de l&#39;Outaouais. A few months later, in February 2013, during my visit to the University of Ottawa, the request was repeated to me. During these two meetings, I said that I would act and, today, it is with pride that I announce that the change of name of the capital and the district will be effective next January ”, declared Minister Bertrand St-Arnaud.
The provisions will also allow the government to update this law from now on by simple regulation rather than by tabling a bill.
“I would like to thank the parliamentarians who made it possible to pass this bill. Thanks to the legislative modifications, we will now be able to modify more effectively the names of a judicial district, of the municipalities that make it up or of a capital, according to the changes that may occur over the years ”, concluded Minister Bertrand. St-Arnaud.
The bill is part of a perspective of modernizing and clarifying the law aimed at facilitating citizens&#39; accessibility to relevant information.
