Quebec - Martine Ouellet, the member for Vachon and official opposition critic for transport, transport electrification and maritime strategy, deplores that the Minister of Transport, Robert Poëti, has refused to act to so that the illegal transport service UberX ceases to operate in Quebec.
Last night, in a parliamentary committee on Bill 36, amending several laws on transport, Martine Ouellet wanted to table an amendment to increase the fines that can be imposed on UberX to those of several European countries. Unfortunately, the minister refused to consent to tabling the amendment.
“Minister Poëti may repeat that UberX is illegal, he refuses to act to counter this service which has continued to grow since his arrival in Quebec. However, during the consultations related to the bill, we had the chance to hear from several stakeholders in the taxi industry who clearly explained to the Minister that UberX was harmful to the economy of Quebec ”, declared Martine Ouellet.
Vehicle seizures have been made since last October, but UberX pays the fines and covers court costs; therefore, the service continues despite everything. The increase in fines, suggested by the Parti Québécois, would allow Quebec to come closer to the sanctions imposed in certain European countries.
“Higher fines, that&#39;s what several European countries have used to release UberX. Meanwhile, in Quebec, representatives of UberX appeared in committee, where they openly said that they did not intend to change their practices, because, according to them, it is not UberX. to change his behavior, but the law to adapt. Despite such an affront, the minister refuses to crack down; It is a shame for the taxi industry, which faces this unfair competition, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
