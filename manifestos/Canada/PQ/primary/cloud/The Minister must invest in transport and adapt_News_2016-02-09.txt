Quebec - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of transport, maritime strategy, transport electrification and digital strategy, Martine Ouellet, and the general director of the Alliance of groups of users of adapted transport of Quebec (ARUTAQ ), Rosanne Couture, called on the Minister of Transport, Jacques Daoust, to reinvest in paratransit services.
Indeed, the deputy for Bourget, Maka Kotto, tabled a petition from ARUTAQ today in the House. This petition of 2,561 signatories asks the National Assembly:
commit to adequate funding that meets current and already foreseeable needs related to the mobility of people with disabilities, so as to facilitate their travel;
“The Quebec government&#39;s funding for paratransit has barely changed for almost 15 years. With the increase in needs and inflation, we might as well say that we are witnessing a clear withdrawal from Quebec in this sector, for which users and municipalities are paying the price, ”said Martine Ouellet.
&quot;It is unacceptable that people are deprived of going to school, going to work and receiving health care because of an underfunding of paratransit, which represents the only means at their disposal to to move, ”added Rosanne Couture.
“With the National Sustainable Mobility Strategy, the former Minister of Transport of the Parti Québécois, Sylvain Gaudreault, put forward a series of measures to improve the supply of paratransit services. Given the fact that the aging of the population is causing a constant increase in needs, he had rightly chosen to increase the envelope. However, when they arrived, the Liberals tabled our strategy and, since then, nothing. As if the situation would resolve itself. Yet there is an emergency! The government must quickly reinvest in paratransit, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
