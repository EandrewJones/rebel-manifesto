Quebec - Following the presentation of the results of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, the Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau, was satisfied with the return of 13.1% obtained in 2013 &quot;For a second consecutive year, the Caisse&#39;s performance exceeded the long-term needs of its depositors,&quot; said the Minister.
The performance of a fund manager such as the Caisse, whose net assets now reach $ 200 billion, can also be measured, and above all, over the long term. &quot;In this regard, the average return of 10% obtained by the Caisse over the past four years deserves to be highlighted,&quot; said the Minister.
In addition, he said he was happy to see that the assets of the Caisse in Quebec have increased by $ 20.3 billion over the past four years. These now stand at $ 53.8 billion. The Minister recalled that the Caisse, in addition to being the fund manager of the major public pension and insurance plans in Quebec, is a major economic player.
&quot;The results announced today are proof, once again, that the two aspects of the Caisse&#39;s mission, namely the search for optimal performance and the economic development of Quebec, can coexist in a profitable and sustainable manner&quot; , concluded the Minister.
