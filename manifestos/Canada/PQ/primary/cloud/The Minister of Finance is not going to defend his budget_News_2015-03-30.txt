Quebec - The member for Rousseau and official opposition critic for finance and revenue, Nicolas Marceau, denounces the absence of the Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, during the first question period following the tabling of his budget .
“While his government called on deputies to sit today, the Minister of Finance preferred to be absent. Perhaps he is embarrassed by his budget, which is far from balanced and which does not take into account the consequences of austerity on middle-class families and the regions of Quebec? He abandoned the economy and income growth to achieve a balanced budget only by cutting public services, ”said Nicolas Marceau.
“The budget tabled last Thursday is an unprecedented attack on public services. It is a budget that will hurt families, that will hurt the sick, and that will hurt our young people by slashing what they have most precious for their future, that is to say their education. . We would have expected the Minister to come at least to defend his budget in front of the elected representatives of the National Assembly, ”concluded the spokesperson.
