Quebec - The Minister of Justice and Minister responsible for the application of professional laws, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, today presented to the National Assembly Bill n ° 49 - An Act to amend various professional laws and others legislative provisions in the field of applied sciences.
The bill responds to one of the recommendations of the Johnson commission, set up following the collapse of the Concorde viaduct, that is, that relating to mandatory monitoring of engineering and architectural work. It also echoes the report of coroner Jacques Ramsay in a case of a concrete beam collapse that caused a death.
“From now on, any execution of a large-scale work, both in the public and private spheres, must be subject to a compliance review. The proposed changes will thus help ensure the quality of engineering and architectural works, ”declared the minister responsible for the application of professional laws.
The proposed legislative changes are also intended, in particular, to update the fields of professional practice of agronomists, architects, chemists, geologists and engineers, as well as to reserve activities at high risk of harm to them.
Other provisions will also allow the professional orders concerned to authorize the exercise, by professional technologists, of certain activities reserved for their members, thus enhancing the contribution of professional technologists to this sector of activity.
“The increase in knowledge as well as the evolution of practices and technologies made it essential to modernize professional practices in the field of applied sciences,” concluded Bertrand St-Arnaud.
