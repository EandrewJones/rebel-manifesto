Quebec - The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, today launches a call for projects for the establishment of two new local justice centers, which will offer free legal information services and orientation to the population.
This call for projects represents an additional step leading to the deployment of these non-profit organizations throughout Quebec, in the wake of government commitments in terms of access to justice. These two new centers will join the three others currently operating in Montreal, Quebec City and Rimouski.
The mission of local justice centers is to promote access to justice by promoting citizen participation through information, support and guidance services offered in complementarity with existing resources. To date, the centers have responded to more than 25,000 requests for legal information, whether in individual meetings or by telephone, in addition to organizing information sessions to popularize legal issues.
“The teams of the existing local justice centers have obtained very positive results since 2010, thanks to their actions aimed at bringing justice closer to citizens. I thank them and I hope that many representatives of the legal community and regional organizations will submit their applications to help create new centers in their respective communities, ”said the Minister of Justice.
Since April 1, 2013, local justice centers have benefited from permanent funding from the Access Justice Fund, an investment of $ 1.6 million for the 2013-2014 fiscal year. This fund administered by the Quebec Department of Justice is used to finance projects aimed at bringing justice closer to citizens. All the information concerning the call for projects, ending on November 22, as well as the nomination form are available online: www.justice.gouv.qc.ca.
