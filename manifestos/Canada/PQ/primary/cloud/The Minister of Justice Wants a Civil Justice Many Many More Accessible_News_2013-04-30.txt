Quebec - The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, today tabled Bill 28 instituting the new Code of Civil Procedure.
“It is with pride that I tabled this new Code of Civil Procedure this afternoon, awaited for several years. I know that modernizing civil procedure is a question that may seem arid and abstract to those who do not evolve in the field of law. However, this will have a considerable impact on reducing the delays and costs of civil justice, so denounced by our fellow citizens. With this new Code of Civil Procedure, I want to instill a culture change among all those involved in the judicial system, ”he said.
The changes to the current rules are proposed to make civil justice much more accessible, while preserving the right of all parties to assert their rights in court. Thus, in order to reduce court delays, the bill emphasizes amicable dispute resolution methods, such as mediation or conciliation, which are more user-friendly, accessible and rapid.
In addition, for parties opting for the traditional judicial route, the draft new Code of Civil Procedure provides that requests, pleadings and evidence must be proportionate to the nature and complexity of the case in question. cause. Judges are also granted increased management powers, in particular to ensure compliance with the principles of proportionality and cooperation enshrined in this new Code of Civil Procedure. They could do so, for example, by examining the number of interviews and expert opinions, two elements repeatedly denounced as significant sources of costs or delays for citizens.
