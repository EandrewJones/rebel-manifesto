Quebec - The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Quebec, Mr. Bertrand St-Arnaud, today tabled Bill 51 amending the Territorial Division Act, to replace the name of the judicial district of Hull by that of Gatineau.
&quot;The process was necessary, both to take into account the new name given to this city and to respond to repeated requests from the Barreau de l&#39;Outaouais,&quot; said the Minister of Justice.
The Territorial Division Act establishes the 36 judicial districts of Quebec, the municipalities and towns that form part of them, as well as the municipality serving as the capital for each of these districts. This law has not been the subject of a real revision since 1975. However, several municipalities have changed their names, have been created or have been abolished following municipal amalgamations. For the sake of efficiency, the bill therefore also proposes that the government be able to update the law by simple regulation rather than by bill.
“From now on, it will be easier to change the name of the judicial district, its capital as well as the list of municipalities that the district includes, which may change over the years. We are also counting on the cooperation of parliamentarians to facilitate the adoption of this bill and thus respond to the demands of stakeholders in the field, ”concluded Minister Bertrand St-Arnaud.
