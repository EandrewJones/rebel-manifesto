Munich - The Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, is today starting a mission in Germany, in particular in the cities of Munich, Berlin and Dresden. This mission will allow the sharing of expertise aimed at fighting crime more effectively.
“This is a unique opportunity to share and deepen our knowledge in order to fight ever more effectively against phenomena such as terrorism and organized crime. This mission will also make it possible to initiate discussions to lay the foundations for collaboration with Saxony in the area of public security, ”the Minister indicated.
During his visit to Germany, Minister Bergeron will also be interested in the issue of the deployment of government assistance during major disasters. “The increase in natural and man-made disasters is forcing the government to ensure that its response and recovery measures meet the expectations of citizens, regardless of the type of disaster. The experiences of Bavaria and Saxony are interesting and I want to know more about how they work. I will also be able to share our recent experiences in this area, ”added the Minister. It should be noted that representatives of the Quebec Red Cross will accompany the Minister on a tour of the Bavarian Red Cross facilities.
Bavaria is one of Quebec&#39;s most important partners abroad. Remember that the governments of Quebec and Bavaria signed a joint declaration in March 2011 on collaboration in the field of public security. This declaration establishes a framework for collaboration between the Ministry of Public Security of Quebec and the Ministry of the Interior of the State of Bavaria which allows the exchange of expertise and best practices in different areas of public security.
