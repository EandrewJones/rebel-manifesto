Quebec - The member for Taillon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of health and access to care, Diane Lamarre, denounces the refusal of the Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette, to specify his intentions regarding the legalization of the imposed surcharges to patients. Today in parliamentary committee, the Minister, against all expectations, continued the detailed study of Bill 20 without tabling the amendments he himself announced in June in order to legalize the imposition, by doctors, overloads to patients.
&quot;Is the minister doing his homework again?&quot; Was he rebuffed by his prime minister? By the Department&#39;s lawyers, who, like us, find that his amendments were against our laws? The Parti Québécois wanted to know. Minister Barrette took refuge in silence and refused to answer any questions put to him by members of the official opposition.
&quot;We demand from the minister that he clarify his intentions, that he be transparent towards parliamentarians and, above all, towards the population because, currently, people are held hostage by doctors and have no other choice. than to pay these surcharges, ”said Diane Lamarre.
Recall that the remuneration of physicians totals nearly $ 7 billion, and that 1% of this sum would be sufficient to pay all ancillary costs. The Parti Québécois reiterates that the only possible solution is the complete and total elimination of ALL ancillary costs.
