Quebec - The Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Mr. Daniel Breton, today welcomed the holding, from October 14 to 21, 2012, of the twelfth edition of the Quebec Reduction Week of waste (SQRD). The Government of Quebec is associated with the realization of the SQRD through RECYC-QUÉBEC, the major partner of the event since its inception.
“Holding such a week promotes the emergence of new behaviors for the benefit of reduction, reuse and recycling, the 3Rs. In Quebec, more and more waste reduction initiatives are emerging thanks to the sustained involvement of various organizations. I would like to congratulate Actions RE-Goals which, year after year, helps raise awareness among Quebecers of the need to reduce the amount of residual materials they produce, ”Minister Breton underlined.
The SDQR&#39;s activities are in line with the Quebec Residual Materials Management Policy, which aims to create a waste-free society while maximizing added value through sound management of residual materials. Remember that nearly 13 million tonnes of residual materials are produced annually in Quebec. However, these materials have undeniable potential for the manufacture of goods and for the production of energy.
“The Quebec Waste Reduction Week is a real call to action. It reminds us that we have a duty to act and adopt a responsible approach to the production of residual materials, both individually and collectively, ”said Minister Breton.
For more than ten years, the SQRD has enabled all Quebecers to adopt the 3R approach to manage our residual materials in an ecological, economical and sustainable manner, which in fact constitute resources. The SQRD highlights different types of 3R initiatives thanks to several challenges (School Challenge, Municipal Challenge, SME Challenge and Survival Without Packaging Challenge) and a calendar of activities held across Quebec.
