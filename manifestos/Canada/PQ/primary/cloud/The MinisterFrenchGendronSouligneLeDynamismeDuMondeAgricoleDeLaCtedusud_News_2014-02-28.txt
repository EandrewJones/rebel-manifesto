Quebec - The Deputy Premier and Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr. François Gendron, would like to take advantage of the 12th Gala recognizing the agricultural world to underline the dynamism of the farmers of Côte-du-Sud as well as their considerable contribution to the development of Quebec&#39;s biofood sector.
“I congratulate the Syndicat des agricultrices de la Côte-du-Sud for this great initiative which recognizes the work of women and men who are building, on a daily basis, an agricultural Quebec of which we can be proud. I am happy to be able to count on partners of this caliber, while we are implementing the Food Sovereignty Policy, which will certainly mark the history of this sector, ”said François Gendron.
The Minister said he was disappointed not to be able to attend the gala but, given the importance of the activity, he gave his special advisor on agriculture the mandate to represent him.
“In this year when family farming is in the spotlight, as decreed by the United Nations, these occasions to pay tribute to enthusiasts who often work in the shadows take on their importance. Hats off to all the winners who will be honored by their peers at La Pocatière! », Concluded Mr. Gendron.
With investments of $ 2.3 billion and annual food demand of nearly $ 34 billion generating 475,000 jobs, the biofood industry is a driving force behind the Quebec economy.
