Québec– The MNA for Saint-Jérôme and official opposition spokesperson for the economy, entrepreneurship, SMEs and exports, Pierre Karl Péladeau, as well as the MNA for Gaspé and spokesperson for Regional Development Officer, Gaétan Lelièvre, denounced the words of Minister Jacques Daoust, in which he described entrepreneurs in the regions facing bankruptcy as &quot;village kings&quot;. How can the minister be so condescending to entrepreneurs? These prejudices and this lack of respect are unacceptable; the minister must apologize.
The minister said, in fact, that bankruptcy &quot;especially hurts the ego in the region, because when you are the king of the village, and you have to go bankrupt, it is difficult&quot;.
“How can the minister be a credible interlocutor for entrepreneurs if he shows so little recognition and appreciation for their work? What particular company was he thinking of when he said &quot;village king&quot;? When a company closes, there are job losses and hardship for suppliers and other associated businesses; that is the real problem, and the minister does not seem to see it. Denigrating entrepreneurs, particularly those in the regions, is staggering, especially when we know that it is SMEs in the regions that create jobs and support economic development, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“By cutting the development tools and resources that we have given ourselves, the Liberal government is undermining 40 years of cooperation and development in the regions. Seeing the lack of consideration shown by Minister Jacques Daoust, we understand the desire for centralization at the heart of the cuts imposed. The effects of business closures are hurting our regions; how will the minister be able to listen to entrepreneurs at all if he treats them with so little respect? », Concluded Gaétan Lelièvre.
