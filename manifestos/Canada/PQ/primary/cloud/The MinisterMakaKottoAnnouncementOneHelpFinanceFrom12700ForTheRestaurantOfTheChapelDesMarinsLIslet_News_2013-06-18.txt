Quebec - The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, announces the allocation of financial assistance of $ 12,700 to the Municipality of L&#39;Islet for the carrying out of restoration work on the Chapel of the Sailors.
The restoration project is estimated at nearly $ 32,000 and mainly involves work to be done on the exterior envelope of the building. The Chapelle des Marins was built in 1835 and classified under the Cultural Heritage Act in 1981. Part of the rich heritage of the municipality of L&#39;Islet, this small religious building recalls the important maritime past of L&#39;Islet , where many sailors and pilots of the St. Lawrence were established. The names of those who disappeared at sea are inscribed on panels placed inside.
“I am happy to anticipate that the contribution announced today will continue to ensure the preservation of an important witness to our history, for present and future generations. We have a responsibility, as a nation, to support our efforts to conserve and enhance these precious legacies, ”said Minister Kotto.
Financial assistance from the Ministry of Culture and Communications comes from component 1 of the Quebec Cultural Heritage Fund and represents 40% of the cost of eligible work. Remember that the objective of this fund is to contribute to the conservation and enhancement of cultural assets of significant heritage value.
Additional information about the Sailors&#39; Chapel is available on the Quebec Cultural Heritage Directory (RPCQ) website (www.patrimoine-culturel.gouv.qc.ca). This dissemination tool from the Ministry of Culture and Communications makes it possible to discover the richness and diversity of Quebec&#39;s cultural heritage by making it accessible to all. Part of the content of the RPCQ can now be found on the Government of Quebec&#39;s open data portal (www.data.gouv.qc.ca).
