Quebec - The Minister of Culture and Communications, Mr. Maka Kotto, made the announcement, during the 26th edition of the RIDEAU scholarship, of his support for eight new multidisciplinary performing arts presenters as of 2013- 2014.
In addition to playing a leading role in linking works with audiences in all regions of Quebec, these presenters represent one of the most powerful tools for the circulation of Quebec song throughout the territory.
“This is an action that I want to make tangible following the Forum sur la chanson québécoise, a forum that has aroused various reactions from actors in the field of song. These new presenters stand out for the importance they attach to Quebec song. This financial assistance will enable them, on the one hand, to consolidate and then expand their programming and, on the other hand, to pursue their mission of developing audiences and stimulating their interest in the performing arts. Ultimately, it is the creators back home who will benefit from this support, ”said Minister Kotto.
The new multidisciplinary presenters supported by the Ministry are:
Following the addition of these eight organizations, the Department will support a total of 104 multidisciplinary presenters spread across the 17 administrative regions of Quebec. For its part, the Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec provides financial support of over $ 5.1 million per year to 62 presenters specializing in theater, dance and music.
