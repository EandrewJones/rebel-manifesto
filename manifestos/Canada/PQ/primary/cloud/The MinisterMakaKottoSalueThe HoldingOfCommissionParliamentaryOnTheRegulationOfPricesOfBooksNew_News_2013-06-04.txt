Quebec - The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, welcomes the holding of a parliamentary committee which will focus on the relevance of regulating the sale price to the public of new printed and digital books and the evaluation of its impacts.
“It is imperative that this regulatory perspective be the subject of a public debate while keeping in mind that the book remains the most important cultural industry in Quebec, with sales estimated at nearly $ 800 million per year. In addition, our objective is to provide the best access to books for citizens, to ensure its diversity as well as the vitality of Quebec players in the book chain, ”said Minister Kotto.
It should be remembered that the regulation of the selling price to the public of new printed and digital books would subject retailers to the sale of new books, for a determined period, at the price set by the publisher or the importer.
The parliamentary committee will take the form of special consultations with representatives of the book industry, consumer associations, retailers and certain stakeholders in the economic, legal and business circles. It will make it possible to measure the cultural, socio-economic, commercial and legal impacts of such regulations, to study their application parameters and to recommend any other necessary measure.
The parliamentary committee will begin on August 19. A consultation document outlining the multiple facets of regulating the sale price to the public of new printed and digital books was prepared by the Ministry of Culture and Communications in order to stimulate reflection and is available on the website of the &#39;National Assembly.
