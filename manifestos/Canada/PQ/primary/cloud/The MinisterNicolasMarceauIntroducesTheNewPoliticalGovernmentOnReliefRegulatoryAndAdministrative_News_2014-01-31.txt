Quebec - As part of the 2014 Paperwork Awareness Week organized by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau, today released the new Government policy on regulatory and administrative relief.
“Legislative and regulatory measures are necessary for the proper functioning of the state, but they have repercussions on businesses. As part of the 2013-2014 budget, our government has undertaken to act to reduce their impact by implementing all of the recommendations of the Task Force on Regulatory and Administrative Simplification. The adoption of a more modern policy is part of this direction ”, declared the Minister.
The objective of the new policy is to reduce the costs associated with the adoption of legislative or regulatory standards for businesses to the essentials required. Among the changes made, the great novelty is the fact that all regulatory projects affecting businesses will now be subject to a regulatory impact analysis by the ministry or body concerned, which will be published systematically.
Moreover, the regulatory burden of the new measures must be modulated according to the size of the businesses and must not be more restrictive than that of Quebec&#39;s trading partners, in particular Ontario. Finally, the ministries and bodies will have to develop a mechanism for reviewing standards according to their specificities.
&quot;The new government policy on regulatory and administrative streamlining will improve the process of drafting laws and regulations that affect businesses, in addition to making it more transparent, and meeting the expectations of the business community,&quot; concluded The Minister.
