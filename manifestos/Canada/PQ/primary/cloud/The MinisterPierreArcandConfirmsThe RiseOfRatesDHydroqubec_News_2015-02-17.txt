Quebec– The member for Marie-Victorin and official opposition spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Bernard Drainville, denounces the attitude of Minister Pierre Arcand; The latter not only confirmed the impending increase in Hydro-Québec&#39;s rates, but he also refused to deny the scenario of privatization of the state-owned company.
Last week, during the first day of consultations on the new energy policy, the minister declared that consumers in Quebec could be hit by an increase in their electricity bill. In fact, he asserted that &quot;for those who use electricity in a very important way, maybe there is a price signal that could be sent.&quot;
“In other words, the minister is announcing a modulated increase in tariffs, as his government did in the case of child care centers. However, by doing so, we increase the overall bill. Today, I gave the minister the opportunity to correct things; instead he repeated his words. We therefore understand that the rate increases are coming, in addition to all the increases that have already hit middle-class families, ”said Bernard Drainville.
Minister refuses to rule out the privatization of Hydro-Québec
The member also denounces the fact that the minister has not closed the door to the Hydro-Quebec privatization scenario, a proposal that is part of the Montmarquette report.
“Those who advocate the idea of privatizing Hydro-Quebec first want the state to increase tariffs, to increase its market value. Asked about this, the minister did not reject the privatization scenario. The Prime Minister has a duty to set the record straight for Quebeckers. What will the rate increase be, and will Hydro-Québec be privatized? This crown corporation is the symbol of our economic nationalism. It is a source of enrichment, it is an engine of economic development for the regions. The population has the right to know, ”concluded Bernard Drainville.
