Quebec - The Minister of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology, Mr. Pierre Duchesne, announces the allocation of financial assistance of $ 700,586 to Collège Lionel-Groulx for the rental of modular units intended for the establishment&#39;s food service spaces.
“The financial assistance that I am announcing today will allow the College to maintain adequate food services. It is important to emphasize that CEGEPs are also a living environment for the student population and the staff who attend them. Quality facilities are therefore essential to provide them with a stimulating and rewarding environment, ”said Minister Duchesne.
In recent years, major expansion work has been carried out at the College to allow it to accommodate a growing student population. This work required investments of more than $ 46 million, funded by the two levels of government and the College.
In 2007, the Ministry authorized the increase in the school budget of the Lionel-Groulx College, thus enabling it to increase the reception capacity from 3,800 to 4,800 places, on the basis of workforce forecasts.
The College and the Department thus have the time necessary to put in place an appropriate real estate solution, this grant of $ 700,586 being spread over the next three years.
&quot;The investment announced today by the Minister eliminates a major irritant for our students who frequent the College cafeteria and, from now on, they will benefit from better access conditions&quot;, mentioned Mr. Michel Louis Beauchamp, Director General of Collège Lionel-Groulx.
