Quebec— The Minister of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology, Mr. Pierre Duchesne, is delighted with the $ 16M contribution from Merck Canada granted to the faculties of medicine at Laval University, from the University of Sherbrooke, the University of Montreal and McGill University. In 2010, Merck pledged to pay $ 100 million over 5 years to various partners in Quebec in support of innovation and academic, biotechnological and clinical research in Quebec.
“This announcement clearly demonstrates that world-class companies like Merck trust Quebec expertise to advance research in the life sciences. These partnership projects will make it possible to consolidate and further develop our local expertise, while promoting it nationally and internationally. Research and teaching are inseparable, but above all essential for the future of all Quebecers. Quebec must therefore adopt a strategy and means of action to participate in these networks for the creation, use and dissemination of knowledge. This is why my department is currently working on the development of a new National Research and Innovation Policy, ”Minister Duchesne indicated.
