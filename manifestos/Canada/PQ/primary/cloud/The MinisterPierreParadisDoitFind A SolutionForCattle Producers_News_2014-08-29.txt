Quebec - The MNA for Berthier and official opposition critic for agriculture, André Villeneuve, deplores the refusal of the Coopérative d&#39;Assage du Québec&#39;s offer to purchase the Levinoff-Colbex slaughterhouse , which causes the dismantling of the slaughterhouse.
“Access to a short-circuit cull cattle slaughterhouse is essential for Quebec producers, who currently have to send their cattle to Ontario or the United States for slaughter. The Minister of Agriculture, Pierre Paradis, must find solutions so that they can have their cattle slaughtered in a short circuit, ”declared André Villeneuve.
The MP points out that the Levinoff-Colbex saga has been very costly for taxpayers; the Liberals have in fact invested large sums of money in it, against the advice of officials. A report by the firm KPMG, published in 2014, moreover demonstrates the liberal fiasco in this file.
It should also be remembered that the takeover of the slaughterhouse in the mid-2000s was very profitable for the Cola brothers, major liberal donors also involved in the scandal of liberal daycare centers. Between 1999 and 2011, the Cola family donated $ 174,000 to the Liberal Party.
“I ask Minister Paradis to be attentive to the needs of producers and the agricultural community. Agriculture creates wealth; it is particularly important for the prosperity of our regions and of all of Quebec. It is heartbreaking to note that Investissement Québec, the slaughterhouse&#39;s main creditor, has not even received the Cooperative so that it can present its project to it, ”the spokesperson concluded.
