Granby– The Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Seniors, Dr. Réjean Hébert, today kicked off the expansion and redevelopment of the Villa Bonheur Residential Center, a facility the Haute-Yamaska Health and Social Services Center (CSSS).
“By supporting this infrastructure project, our government is ensuring that the health and well-being of residents always remain at the heart of our concerns. The improvements that will be made to this residential and long-term care center will provide more comfortable and safer premises.

The CSSS de la Haute-Yamaska and the Agence de la santé et des services sociaux de la Montérégie will invest, respectively, $ 2.61 million and $ 0.95 million to carry out this project estimated at $ 6.68 million. .
