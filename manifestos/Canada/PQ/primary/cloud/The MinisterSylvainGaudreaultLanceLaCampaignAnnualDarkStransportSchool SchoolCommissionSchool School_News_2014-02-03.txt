Saguenay– The Minister of Transport, Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Member of Parliament for Jonquière, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, launched this morning, as honorary president, the annual safety campaign in school transport from the De La Jonquière school board.
During a luncheon held in the Jonquière borough, in Saguenay, Mr. Gaudreault addressed a group of stakeholders made up of elected officials and staff of the school board, coordinators in school transport and bus drivers in the area. “We need to unite our voices to remember that the safety of schoolchildren is everyone&#39;s business. In this sense, I made sure that the Minister of Transport issues safety reminders everywhere in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, ”said Mr. Gaudreault, indicating that approximately 5,200 students use the services of the De La Jonquière School Board to visit some 20 primary and secondary schools.
The launch took place on the occasion of the 26th School Transportation Safety Campaign of the Quebec School Transport Association (ATEQ). On the theme &quot;Have you seen me? ”, This campaign aims to make road users aware of their responsibility for the safety of schoolchildren who use the bus. This year, ATEQ has put online the new microsite www.mastuvu.info, which allows everyone, both drivers and students, to review the safe behaviors to adopt in the presence of school buses, in school zones and in school lessons.
