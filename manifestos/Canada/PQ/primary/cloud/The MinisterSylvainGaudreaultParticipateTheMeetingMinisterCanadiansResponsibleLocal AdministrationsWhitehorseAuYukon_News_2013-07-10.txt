Quebec - The Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, is taking part, as of today, in the Meeting of Canadian Ministers responsible for local administrations which is taking place in Whitehorse, Yukon.
During the meeting, Minister Gaudreault will discuss with his counterparts crucial themes for the field of municipal affairs. In particular, dialogue with municipalities, municipal infrastructure, capacity building for municipalities and municipal taxation will be discussed.
&quot;Quebec&#39;s participation in this meeting is an opportunity to present our government&#39;s vision and specific concerns while recalling the issues and challenges that more specifically affect Quebec and its municipalities,&quot; said Mr. Gaudreault.
