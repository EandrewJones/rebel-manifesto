Quebec, August 16, 2016 - The MNA for René-Lévesque and Parti Québécois spokesperson for municipal affairs, Martin Ouellet, and the MNA for Richelieu and spokesperson for labor, Sylvain Rochon, denounce the fact that the only consequence of Bill 110, An Act respecting the system for negotiating collective agreements and settling disputes in the municipal sector, will be to increase the powers of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Martin Coiteux.
“The minister has created false expectations with municipalities. The cities of Montreal and Quebec, as well as the Quebec Federation of Municipalities and the Union of Quebec Municipalities, are calling for substantial changes to Bill 110. For their part, the union groups are openly saying that they will challenge the law. . Because all the bill will do is empower the minister. It&#39;s insane, ”explained the member for René-Lévesque.
&quot;Imagine: the Labor Code is being rewritten through a bill on municipal affairs, and the Ministry of Labor has been kept out of the process&quot;, for its part illustrated the Member of Parliament for Richelieu.
&quot;Finally, let us remember that if the government succeeded in concluding the most recent fiscal pact with the cities, despite the cuts of $ 300 million per year that it imposed on them, it is only because it was committed to table this bill. However, it is now clear that he broke his promise, in addition to arousing enormous fears on the side of municipal employees, since no one knows what Minister Coiteux will do with the new powers he is giving himself, ”a concluded Martin Ouellet.
