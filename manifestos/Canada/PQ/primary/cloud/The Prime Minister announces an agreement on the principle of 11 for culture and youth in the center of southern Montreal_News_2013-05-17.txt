Montreal– The Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, accompanied by the Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, and the Member of Parliament for Sainte-Marie – Saint-Jacques and Parliamentary Assistant to the Premier (electrification of transport), Daniel Breton, today announced an agreement in principle of $ 11M for the Center-Sud cultural community in Montreal. The Minister responsible for the Montreal region, Minister of International Relations, La Francophonie and Foreign Trade, Jean-François Lisée, also participated in the event.
This agreement in principle from the Ministry of Culture and Communications will enable Le Cube, an international center for research and creation in theater for children and young people, which brings together the Carrousel and the Théâtre Le Clou, to establish in the Sainte-Brigide-de-Kildare church as part of the project overseen by the Sainte-Brigide Community Center.
“The installation of the Cube in the Sainte-Brigide-de-Kildare church is part of the transformation of the Sainte-Brigide islet into a cultural and community complex. It will make it possible to preserve a place of worship in a spirit of sustainable development, and to preserve a religious heritage building which bears witness to the history of the district. I am very proud of the new vocation of the church, which will consolidate the Center-Sud pole as a cultural district, a desire of the Rendez-vous 2012 - Montreal, cultural metropolis ”, declared the Premier.
