Quebec - Following the death of Camil Samson, Quebec Premier Pauline Marois paid tribute to the memory of the former leader of the Ralliement Créditiste.
“Camil Samson left no one indifferent. His colorful language and the images he used to express his ideas marked the political history of Quebec. Many people recognized themselves in his outspokenness and in the issues he addressed. He belonged to a class of politicians apart. He is an incomparable politician, ”said the Prime Minister.
Pauline Marois also recalled Camil Samson&#39;s attachment to the people he represented. Originally from the Mauricie region, he had solidly established himself in Rouyn-Noranda, a riding for which he was the Member of the National Assembly for 11 years.
Pauline Marois and members of the Quebec government team come together to offer their sincere condolences to Camil Samson&#39;s family and loved ones.
