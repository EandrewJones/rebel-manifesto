Montreal - The Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, and the Minister responsible for Indigenous Affairs, Élizabeth Larouche, offer their best wishes to all Indigenous people in Quebec and invite the population, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to mark the National Day of Indigenous Peoples .
“May this day be a special moment for all Aboriginals in Quebec. This is the perfect opportunity to celebrate and honor your cultures, your languages, your traditions and your history, ”declared the Premier, who, moreover, is participating today in Montreal in an important meeting with representatives of the Inuit nation.
For her part, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs will mark the National Indigenous Peoples Day in her riding of Abitibi-Est, by participating in activities organized by the Val-d&#39;Or Native Friendship Center.
“I invite all Quebecers, native and non-native, to mark this day. The better we get to know each other, the better we will live together. I hope that we will continue on the path of collaboration, respect and dialogue, ”said Ms. Larouche.
Let us recall that it was in 1990 that the National Assembly of Quebec unanimously adopted a motion recognizing June 21 as “National Day of the Native Peoples”.
