Quebec - The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of education, research and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, asks the Minister of Education, Sébastien Proulx, to stop concentrating his efforts on the image of the Liberal Party of Quebec and to take concrete action, as it promised, for the educational success of young people.
“While the minister is wasting time asserting and reaffirming that he believes in kindergarten 4, he is not even able to deliver the 70 additional classes announced last November. This is concrete proof that the announcements of the past week are only an operation aimed at restoring the image of his party, tarnished by the events of recent years: let us remember, 4 ministers of Education succeeded one another. for 2 years, and cuts by the hundreds of millions have been made in the network, ”said the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
“When we questioned the Minister of Education earlier this week about his supposed new game plan, we were left unsatisfied. There was nothing on this subject in the last budget tabled only 2 months ago, no amount set aside to finance the new measures. There was nothing for kindergarten 4 years old, nothing about school until 18 years old, nothing for the National Institute of Education. In short, we are in the most complete improvisation. Obviously, the minister simply wanted to attract attention before the Liberal congress, ”added Alexandre Cloutier.
