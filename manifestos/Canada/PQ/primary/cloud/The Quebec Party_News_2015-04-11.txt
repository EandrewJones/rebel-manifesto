Quebec - In addition to his participation and that of several other members of the Parti Québécois in the Climate Action March, the member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and the environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, invites Quebecers to massively support the fight against climate change and Quebec&#39;s ecological transition to renewable energies.
“The message that will be sent by the Quebecers present in the capital today is very clear: YES to climate protection and renewable energies, and NO to the TransCanada pipeline project and to oil from the tar sands! We fully support citizens in their approach, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault.
People have been mobilizing for several years to counter the exploitation of shale gas in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. “Quebecers have shown extraordinary solidarity when it comes to blocking the road to shale gas. I invite each of them to continue their mobilization and to aim more broadly at the preservation of our climate, ”added the Member for Jonquière.
The Parti Québécois also recalls that an independent Quebec would be stronger and better equipped to fight climate change. “As long as we are a province, projects like TransCanada&#39;s Energy East pipeline will try to make Quebec a highway for Alberta oil. We must therefore be able to make our own choices, and this is the reason why we tabled Bill 390, aimed at affirming the primacy of Quebec&#39;s jurisdiction in environmental matters, ”concluded Sylvain Gaudreault. .
