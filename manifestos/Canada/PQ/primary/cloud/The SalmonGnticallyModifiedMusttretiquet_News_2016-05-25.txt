Quebec - The member for Berthier and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of agriculture and food, André Villeneuve, deplores that no law requiring the labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has been adopted, although he first genetically modified animal, the AquAdvantage salmon, has just been approved by Health Canada.
“Last Thursday, the AquAdvantage salmon, produced by the US company AquaBounty Technologies, became the first genetically modified animal to be approved for human consumption. However, since GMO labeling is not mandatory, Quebecers will have no way of knowing if the salmon on their plate is genetically modified. The minister should have worked on mandatory labeling as soon as he took office. However, two years later, he still has not filed anything, ”explained the deputy for Berthier.
“AquaBounty Technologies anticipates that the genetically modified AquAdvantage salmon will be produced as early as next year. It is essential that the Minister of Agriculture assure Quebecers that a law requiring the labeling of GMOs will be adopted by then. Our concern is more than justified. Let us remember that in 2003, Jean Charest already promised Quebecers mandatory labeling of GMOs. In nine years in power, the Liberal Party has done nothing, whereas today 64 countries have made this labeling compulsory, ”added André Villeneuve.
“Quebecers don&#39;t want to wait another nine years; the Liberal Party must act now on the labeling of GMOs. Citizens want and have the right to know what is on their plate. Yet today the minister refused to make a commitment when I asked him the question. It is deplorable, ”concluded the member for Berthier.
