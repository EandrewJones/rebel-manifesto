Quebec - Sovereign Quebec would be a rich country. This is confirmed by the update of the international ranking of countries by the Institut de la statistique du Québec. In this document made public Thursday, countries are classified according to their GDP per capita (in PPP), this indicator constituting the standard par excellence for measuring the wealth of a nation.
Nicolas Marceau, Member of Parliament for Rousseau and spokesperson for the official opposition in matters of finance and income, noted that, in this ranking, Quebec was ranked 27th out of 240 countries in the world in 2013, a remarkable performance . “Quebec is one of the richest nations in the world; it belongs to the group of the most prosperous 11% ”, noted the deputy. Note that in this ranking, Quebec is in the company of other countries among the most advanced economically and socially, just behind Finland (23rd), France (24th), Japan (25th) and the United Kingdom. (26th), and ahead of New Zealand (28th).
“No one would ever think of questioning the ability of all of these countries to exercise their sovereignty. That of Quebec to become a country, a rich country, moreover, is therefore no doubt, ”said the member for Rousseau.
While acknowledging that Quebec, like so many other countries in the world, has great challenges to meet, Nicolas Marceau declared: “The detractors of Quebec, with their miserable speech, must see the facts: we are rich. Quebec must of course continue to grow and meet major challenges, but it remains an inescapable fact: it is rich and all paths, including that of sovereignty, are open to it. &quot;
