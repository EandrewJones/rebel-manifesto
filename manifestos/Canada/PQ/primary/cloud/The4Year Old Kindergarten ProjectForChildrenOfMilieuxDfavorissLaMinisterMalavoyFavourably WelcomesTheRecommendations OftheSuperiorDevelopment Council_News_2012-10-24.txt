Quebec - The Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports, Mrs. Marie Malavoy, has taken note of the opinion of the Superior Council of Education on preschool education, made public today. She welcomes the Council&#39;s recommendations, particularly the first, which deals with access to kindergarten for 4-year-olds.
In its opinion, the Council suggests that the government set itself the objective that 90% of children aged 4 can attend education and childcare services regulated by the State within 5 years. It also recommends ensuring priority access to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.
“I am delighted that the recommendations of the Council and the vision of our government come together. This opinion will feed our reflection on how to set up full-time kindergarten in disadvantaged areas for 4-year-old children. This is a priority mandate entrusted to me by Prime Minister Marois, which aims to guarantee equal opportunities in a spirit of solidarity ”, declared Minister Malavoy.
In addition, the Council raises concerns which are also those of the Minister, namely the preservation of a plurality of service offers. “There is no question of imposing a uniform measure or making 4-year-old kindergarten compulsory. The envisaged service is aimed at children from disadvantaged backgrounds who, for one reason or another, do not attend childcare centers, ”recalls the Minister.
The project to offer 4-year-old kindergarten to children from disadvantaged backgrounds will become a tool in the fight against school failure and dropping out. It is part of early educational intervention measures.
