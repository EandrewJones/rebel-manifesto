On March 18, the Power to the Regions conference was held in Rimouski. Although organized by the Parti Québécois de Rimouski et du Bas-Saint-Laurent, this event was open to everyone in order to discuss issues in the regions of Quebec.
With a large number of participants and enriching debates, we present to you the proceedings of the conference which, we hope, translate as faithfully as possible the reflections and testimonies presented during this event.
