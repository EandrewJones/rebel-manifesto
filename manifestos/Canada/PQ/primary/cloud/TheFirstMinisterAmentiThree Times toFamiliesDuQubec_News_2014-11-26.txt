Quebec - The member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, and the member for Terrebonne and family spokesperson, Mathieu Traversy, denounce the new surprise that the Liberal government has in store for families in Quebec, while the development of new childcare places is totally slowed down.
“All Quebecers keep in mind that the Prime Minister was elected by promising to cancel the $ 2 increase in the price of childcare services, which had been announced before the elections. However, he knew the real situation of public finances when he entrusted the Minister with the task of developing the network and preventing a tariff shock. Indeed, when the Minister of Families was sworn in on April 23, the Prime Minister told her, and I quote: &quot;you will see to continue the development of child care spaces and [to] avoid a tariff shock for families. of the middle class by opting for price indexation &quot;. So he has twice reneged on his word, ”said Stéphane Bédard.
Third follow-up
In addition, on November 20, in a short line in a press release, the Prime Minister announced the end of the development of reduced-contribution childcare places, except those already under construction or made official by a contract. sign. This means in particular that the development of the 15,000 places has stopped, but, even more, that that of three quarters of the 13,000 places announced in 2011 is also.
“Since yesterday, counselors from the Ministry of the Family have called the day care service project managers to tell them that everything is now on ice. In Montreal, 2,692 spaces were granted. As only 205 places have already been built or are in the process of being built, there are 2487 children for whom we will now have to find a new place. In Laval, all projects are blocked. In short, Quebec families have been betrayed three times by the Prime Minister and his government, ”concluded Mathieu Traversy.
