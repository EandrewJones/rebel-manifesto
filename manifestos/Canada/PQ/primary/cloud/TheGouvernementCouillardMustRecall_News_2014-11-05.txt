Québec, November 5, 2014 - The member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, asks the Prime Minister to step back on the issue of the new fiscal pact that he intends to impose on municipalities in Quebec, because it would have as a consequence of making regional taxpayers pay $ 300 million in additional taxes.
“Several mayors of Quebec confirmed yesterday that the Liberal government is preparing to pass on a tax hike of $ 300 million to them. Contrary to the claims of Minister Pierre Moreau, the new fiscal pact does not include any mechanism or any commitment not to increase taxes. It even announces new means of taxation for municipalities. The Prime Minister must step back and call his minister to order, ”declared Stéphane Bédard.
The leader of the official opposition also underlined the words of the president of the Quebec Federation of Municipalities, Richard Lehoux, who recently stated that “there will either be an increase in taxes or a reduction in services. No one can deny that there will be an impact ”. Several mayors have even spoken openly of an agreement with Montreal and Quebec that would have been negotiated at the expense of all the other municipalities.
“The Minister of Municipal Affairs, essentially, exchanged a bill of 300 million against Bill 3. The policy of the Liberal government is division: regions against each other, and mayors against each other. other. The liberal solution is the centralization of powers in Quebec and the outsourcing of tax increases to municipalities, and therefore to regional taxpayers, ”concluded Stéphane Bédard.
