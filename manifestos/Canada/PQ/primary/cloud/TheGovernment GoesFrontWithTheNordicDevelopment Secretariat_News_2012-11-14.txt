Quebec - Quickly following up on one of the commitments made in the opening speech, the government is announcing the creation of the Northern Development Secretariat, whose mandate will be to coordinate the actions of the entire government apparatus in order to respond to the needs of northern communities and to ensure the development of the North in a coherent manner.
In addition, the Ministerial Action Group, chaired by the Prime Minister, and supported by the Ministry of Finance and the Economy, the Ministry of Natural Resources and the future Economic Development Bank, will closely monitor major economic projects on the territory of northern Quebec.
Administratively located within the Minister of the Executive Council, the Secrétariat au développement nordique will be under the responsibility of the Minister of Natural Resources, Martine Ouellet, who will be assisted by the Minister responsible for the Côte-Nord and Nord-du-Québec regions. , Alexandre Cloutier, MP for Duplessis, Lorraine Richard, MP for René-Lévesque, Marjolain Dujour, and MP for Ungava, Luc Ferland. The Secretariat will make the necessary connections with the departments and bodies to provide appropriate follow-up to the requests made to it.
&quot;The development of the North will allow Quebec to join the nations that have taken the turn of sustainable development, respectful of the environment and of communities,&quot; said Pauline Marois during her opening speech. However, to ensure the coherence of the development of a territory as immense as Northern Quebec, it is essential to coordinate the actions of the entire government apparatus. The government is therefore putting in place the appropriate tools so that Quebec can move forward with the development of the North, while ensuring that this development is beneficial for all.
