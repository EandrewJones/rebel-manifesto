Quebec - With the support of the various police forces in Quebec, the Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, calls for the adoption of a unanimous motion from the National Assembly so that the funding of the Police Recruitment Fund be extended permanently, beyond March 31, 2013
This program has so far made it possible to provide crucial financial support to police organizations for the establishment of squads specializing in the fight against crime as well as the retention of more than 100 police officers assigned to these squads. This is an important issue for public safety in Quebec.
“The end of this funding program would have serious consequences. The federal government cannot boast of fighting organized crime and, at the same time, threatening its sustainability. Consequently, we ask the federal Minister of Public Security, Mr. Vic Toews, to reassess his position and ensure full, sustainable and long-term funding for this Fund, ”said Minister Bergeron.
Members of the National Assembly will therefore have to decide on the following motion:
“That the National Assembly ask the federal government to reassess its position and to renew the Police Recruitment Fund beyond March 31, 2013.
That the National Assembly recall that the sustainability of this funding is essential to maintaining police initiatives aimed at combating several criminal phenomena, in particular street gangs and drug trafficking. &quot;
