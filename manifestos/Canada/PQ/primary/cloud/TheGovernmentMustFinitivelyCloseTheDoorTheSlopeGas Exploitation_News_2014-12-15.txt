Quebec - Following the publication of the report of the Bureau d&#39;Audiences Publiques sur l&#39;Environnement (BAPE) on the exploitation of shale gas, the member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, as well as the member for Marie-Victorin and energy and natural resources critic, Bernard Drainville, believe that the Liberal government must now close the door once and for all.
“The BAPE report clearly indicates that the exploitation of shale gas would not be beneficial for Quebec. It would also have many environmental impacts, including deterioration of air quality, increased noise and road traffic, in addition to risks to the quality of surface and groundwater. In addition, the shale gas industry would increase greenhouse gas emissions by 3% to 23%. The Minister of the Environment must now clearly indicate that his government will refuse any exploration or exploitation of shale gas in Quebec, ”declared Sylvain Gaudreault.
The report also notes that, according to the “benefit-cost” analysis of the strategic environmental assessment, prior to that of the BAPE, the natural gas prices projected by the United States Energy Information Administration would not ensure the profitability of shale gas exploitation in Quebec. Overall, this analysis overestimated the benefits to Quebec in the event of shale gas development.
The government must finally listen to the people
The member for Marie-Victorin recalls for his part that the Liberal government is seeking to revive the shale gas industry by setting up a strategic environmental assessment &quot;on all hydrocarbons&quot;.
“The government has already caused enough concern among the people of the St. Lawrence Valley. Beyond the significant environmental risks, the BAPE report indicates that the perceived economic benefits would not be present. He also mentions that social acceptability would not be acquired. For us, the answer is clear: shale gas would move us away from our goal of decreasing our dependence on fossil fuels. The Liberals must finally listen to the people and say no to shale gas, ”concluded Bernard Drainville.
