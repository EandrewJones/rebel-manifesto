Quebec - The member for Saint-Jérôme and leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, and the member for Rousseau and the Parti Québécois spokesperson on finance and revenue, Nicolas Marceau, demand that the Prime Minister anticipates the tabling of the government&#39;s economic and financial update, in order to take stock of the effect of the economic deterioration on the Quebec budget.
“During the summer, nearly 12,000 jobs were lost in Quebec, while others were created in the rest of Canada. Montreal is even now considered the capital of unemployment! Since taking office, the Prime Minister and his team have offered absolutely nothing in terms of economic development or job creation. Philippe Couillard must stop saying that all is well, take stock and act to get the economy out of the doldrums, ”declared the leader of the official opposition.
Nicolas Marceau for his part maintained that the budget forecasts no longer hold: “In addition to the jobs lost this summer, the GDP fell again by 0.5% in May, after having experienced a decline of 0.3% in April and 0.1% in March. This bad news has led Desjardins to revise its growth forecasts for Quebec downwards, fixing it at only 1.3% for 2015. The government, for its part, is basing itself on a growth of 2%, which is absolutely not sustainable. the road, ”he worried.
Even the Ministry of Finance confirmed, last week, a deficit of half a billion, after only two months of the 2015 fiscal year, as well as a significant delay on the side of own-source revenue, when we should, according to the Liberals , find ourselves in a balanced budget situation.
“Our economy is deteriorating; that&#39;s what all of this bad news indicates. It is essential to know quickly and exactly where we are. The economic and financial update must therefore be tabled as quickly as possible, ”concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
