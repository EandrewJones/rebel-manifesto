Quebec - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for SMEs and innovation, André Villeneuve, asks Minister Carlos Leitão to waive the 47.5% tax hike that will be imposed on very small SMEs from the 1st January 2017.
“This tax hike was hidden in the March 2015 budget! The Parti Québécois voted against this measure. We also sent a written response to the entrepreneurs who had sent us a letter-petition during the month of February to denounce this injustice, ”said the deputy.
Here is the response from the Parti Québécois:
“The Quebec economy has stagnated since April 2014. Growth is down compared to forecasts, job losses are on the increase, and private investments are at neutral.
Our economy should normally have benefited from two phenomena that favor it: the fall of the Canadian dollar and that of the price of oil. However, it is not.
Despite these alarming findings, the Liberal government has decided to increase taxes for small SMEs as of January 1, 2017. This increase will reach an additional $ 200 million in 2018-2019. We believe that Quebec and our businesses do not need this new tax, which targets the smallest of our SMEs and will slow down their growth.
You can count on us to denounce to the government this unfair and senseless increase in your taxes, in these particularly difficult economic times. &quot;
“The government should table an economic development strategy to grow its revenues instead of increasing taxes for SMEs. Our SMEs are the real economic heart of Quebec; let&#39;s give them some oxygen! », Concluded André Villeneuve.
