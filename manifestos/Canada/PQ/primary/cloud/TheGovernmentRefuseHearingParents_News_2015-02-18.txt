Quebec - The member for Terrebonne and official opposition spokesperson for family matters, Mathieu Traversy, deplores the attitude of the Liberal MPs, who have denied democracy by refusing that the Committee on Citizen Relations take up a petition signed by nearly 90,000 people. This calls for the safeguard of the family policy, the maintenance of the universality of tariffs and the redeployment of the creation of reduced-contribution childcare places.
“The PLQ deputies present at the committee categorically refused to take into account the opinion of nearly 90,000 parents who are worried about the effects of liberal austerity on their families. In accordance with the line of conduct of the Minister for Families, who was absent yesterday, the Liberal deputies have decided not to listen to the population. Significantly increase fees, curb plans to create childcare spaces… these decisions hurt Quebec families and the middle class. It would have been desirable for the government to hear the parents, instead of locking itself in its ideology, ”said Mathieu Traversy.
