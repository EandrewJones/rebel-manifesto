Quebec - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of education, research and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, deplores that the government is abandoning support for school perseverance in favor of an intermixing of structures that does not help in any way students. In fact, despite its electoral commitment to make education a priority, the Liberal government is increasing the cuts in this sector and jeopardizing the network of organizations fighting against dropping out of school across Quebec.
“Last September, in the wake of the tens of millions of dollars cut to programs encouraging perseverance in school, I questioned the Minister of Education. He admitted his mistake and made a commitment, in front of all the deputies of the National Assembly, to restore the sums. However, five months later, no reinvestment has been announced, and the sacrifice of programs and professionals who encourage young people to stay in school continues, ”said Alexandre Cloutier.
It should be noted that the Journées de la persévérance scolaire, which will take place from February 15 to 19, are a unique opportunity for all Quebec students to participate in activities aimed at raising public awareness of the importance of education, and our young people to continue their studies and obtain their diplomas.
“Next week, however, thousands of young people will be deprived of activities. In Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Laval and Quebec City, none is on the schedule, because partner organizations have been closed due to cuts by the Couillard government. In recent months, hundreds of projects have been abandoned across all regions. For a Prime Minister who claims to make education a priority, it is a failure; he keeps proving us the opposite. When will we see a real plan to promote the academic success of our young people? », Concluded Alexandre Cloutier.
