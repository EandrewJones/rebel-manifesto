Quebec - The member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, Jean-François Lisée, deplores the refusal of the Minister for Rehabilitation, Youth Protection and Public Health, Lucie Charlebois, to commit to paying the planned sums to community organizations. The Coalition of Regional Tables of Community Organizations and the Table of Provincial Groupings of Community and Voluntary Organizations came away very disappointed from their meeting today with the Minister Delegate.
&quot;At the same time when the Prime Minister repeated that he was going to honor his commitment to protect low-income people, it is incomprehensible that his minister refuses to give any hope whatsoever to the groups she met,&quot; said Jean -François Lisée.
&quot;Refusing to confirm the increase in funding for community organizations, announced by our government, is to jeopardize hundreds of projects deployed across Quebec and actions that are taken on a daily basis with the most vulnerable people,&quot; said added the deputy.
The wealth of a society is also measured by the way in which it takes care of the most disadvantaged, and this notably involves support for community organizations. The Parti Québécois government had provided for an increase of $ 54 million per year, a building acquisition and renovation program of $ 10 million for these groups and measures to support the staff of the 4,000 community organizations concerned.
“The Liberal Party cannot, after having supported, in a unanimous motion in May 2013, these same groups in their demands, change its mind and refuse to increase the funding of their global mission. If he confirms this orientation in the budget, he will have reneged on his word and turned his back on the most fragile citizens of our society, ”concluded Jean-François Lisée, who also noted the CAQ&#39;s decision to no longer support groups. community.
