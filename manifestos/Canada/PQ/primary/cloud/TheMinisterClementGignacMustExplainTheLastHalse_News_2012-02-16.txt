Quebec - The MP for Marie-Victorin and official opposition spokesperson for energy, Bernard Drainville, asks the Minister of Natural Resources, Clément Gignac, to explain to motorists the increase in the price of gasoline in the last few hours, a sudden increase of 8 ¢ per liter in the Quebec City region. Note that an increase of 10 ¢ per liter in the Montreal region, some time ago, was described as unjustified by an economist from the Mouvement Desjardins.
“Motorists this morning are right to be angry. Such a sudden increase in the price of gasoline at the pump has a direct impact on families&#39; budgets. Minister Gignac must explain this increase to motorists, ”said Bernard Drainville.
Like CAA-Quebec, the Parti Québécois finds the price set at $ 1.39 abnormal. The CAA-Quebec estimates that the price should be more around $ 1.35, or 4 ¢ less. “The international situation is one thing, of course, but such a shock at the pump remains inexplicable and the difference of 4 ¢ between the CAA-Quebec estimates and the real price is considerable. How to explain this? Asks Bernard Drainville, who points out that in 2011, Quebeckers paid on average 20 ¢ more for a liter of gasoline.
More than ever, the Parti Québécois considers it necessary to remove Quebeckers from their dependence on oil, which eats up a large part of their budget.
“Energy independence is not a dream, but a necessity; it will contribute to the enrichment of Quebecers. By reducing our purchases of petroleum products, we will be able to strongly stimulate the Quebec economy since the billions of dollars currently devoted to importing petroleum will be invested here in clean energies. Rather than enriching the oil companies, we can enrich Quebec and Quebeckers, ”concluded Bernard Drainville.
