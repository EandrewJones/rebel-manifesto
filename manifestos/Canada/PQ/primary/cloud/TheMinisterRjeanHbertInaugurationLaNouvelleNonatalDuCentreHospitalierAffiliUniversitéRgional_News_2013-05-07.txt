Trois-Rivières - The Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Seniors, Réjean Hébert, today inaugurated the new neonatal unit of the Center hospitalier affilié universitaire régionale du Center de santé et de services sociaux de Trois-Rivières, after completion of expansion and redevelopment work of $ 1,284,500. He was accompanied for the occasion by the member for Champlain, Noëlla Champagne.
“This hospital center has a regional mandate in pediatrics, perinatology and neonatology. The neonatal unit now benefits from spacious, modern and well-equipped premises. The increase in the number of beds, from 7 to 12, will make it possible to accommodate a greater number of newborns needing specialized care, in particular because of a preterm birth, ”explained Minister Hébert.
Recall that the real estate component of this project, which amounts to $ 750,000, benefited from an investment of $ 262,000 from the establishment, $ 166,000 from the Agence de la santé et des services social projects in Mauricie and Center-du-Québec, as well as a contribution of $ 161,000 from the Department and equivalent funding from Opération Enfant-Soleil. The balance of this project, which amounted to $ 534,500, and which is dedicated to the acquisition of specialized medical equipment, was fully funded by the Department.
“The Regional Affiliated University Hospital Center is set to experience remarkable growth over the next few years, to the benefit of the population of the Mauricie and Center-du-Québec region. I would also remind you that Prime Minister Pauline Marois and Minister Hébert recently confirmed the construction of a new four-storey wing, as well as a major redevelopment of part of the current facilities, an ambitious project of around 50 million dollars, ”declared MP Noëlla Champagne.
