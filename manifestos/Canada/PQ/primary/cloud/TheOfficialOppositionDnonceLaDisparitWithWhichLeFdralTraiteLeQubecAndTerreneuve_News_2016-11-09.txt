Quebec, November 9, 2016 - In a Wednesday motion, the official opposition denounces the disparity with which the federal government treats the provinces, in particular Quebec, when taking into account the considerable advantage it has granted to Newfoundland and Labrador, through a loan guarantee that now stands at $ 9.2 billion for its Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project.
This loan guarantee, which covers a period of 35 to 40 years, will represent savings of nearly $ 1.5 billion for the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, or a sum of $ 2,750 per capita. “If the federal government guaranteed Hydro-Québec&#39;s loans, as it does for the Muskrat Falls project, the long-term borrowing rates of the crown corporation would be reduced, which would represent a saving of 13, $ 5 billion over 30 years, ”commented the leader of the official opposition, Jean-François Lisée.
By tabling this motion, the official opposition is trying to obtain the support of the Members of the National Assembly to claim from the federal government the equivalent of the direct and indirect benefits granted to Newfoundland and Labrador for its investments. oil companies, including the exclusion of its offshore revenues in the calculation of its equalization.
“The Quebec Minister responsible for Canadian Relations, Jean-Marc Fournier, is asking for a&quot; win-win &quot;agreement with the federal government, to restore fairness to Quebec and without penalizing Newfoundland, in the Muskrat Falls file. Clearly, Mr. Fournier is claiming a similar financial advantage for Quebec and we offer him our full support. The motion we are presenting makes it possible to concretely embody the re-establishment of this equity, ”insisted Nicolas Marceau, Parti Québécois spokesperson for Quebec-Canada relations.
We should also remember that the federal government still refuses to give us $ 463 million for the ice storm that occurred almost twenty years ago, in 1998.
