Quebec - The member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, asked Prime Minister Philippe Couillard to say whether he still trusts his Minister of the Economy, Innovation and Exports, Jacques Daoust .
“Rumors and the media point to the minister&#39;s departure in June. Does this mean that Quebec will not have a Minister of the Economy by then? The Prime Minister must reiterate his confidence in Jacques Daoust or dismiss him immediately. Because if the minister no longer has the confidence of Philippe Couillard, how will he be able to fulfill his mandates? », Asked Stéphane Bédard.
“The numerous job losses - at Bombardier, Alcan, Resolute, in particular - are worrying. Quality jobs are disappearing. We need a real economic development policy and a person to put it in place. Already the Liberal government is practicing chronic carelessness in matters of the economy, it should not, in addition, find itself with a minister who no longer has the confidence of his boss, ”added the head of the official opposition.
