Quebec - The member for Saint-Jean and official opposition critic for employment, vocational training, literacy and youth, Dave Turcotte, asks Premier Philippe Couillard, responsible for youth issues, to remove the uncertainty surrounding the survival of regional youth forums.
“The presidencies are worried about the government&#39;s lack of transparency; they do not even know if the youth forums will continue to exist! Rumors persist, and no one in government meets with the grouping of regional youth forums; what is this way of acting? The first thing to do would be, at the very least, to contact the youth forums and respond to their concerns, ”said Dave Turcotte.
“Unfortunately, young people are paying the price for liberal austerity and will also pay the price of major cuts to come. The 19 youth forums are important organizations, aiming in particular to improve the citizen participation of young people and relay their priorities to municipal and Quebec elected officials. The government must remove the uncertainty that hangs over their future, ”concluded the deputy.
