Quebec - &quot;Is the Premier of Alberta, Jim Prentice, registered as a lobbyist for the company TransCanada?&quot; Prime Minister Philippe Couillard must tell him very clearly that Quebec will never give up its power to decide on environmental matters, ”declared the member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and environmental issues. environment, Sylvain Gaudreault, on the occasion of the visit to Quebec by the Premier of Alberta.
The MP also asks the Prime Minister not to commit to anything with his Albertan counterpart regarding the Energy East project before the BAPE has completed its assessment. “The Liberal government must immediately mandate a BAPE for the entire project, in order to assess the impacts throughout the route of the pipe. In fact, Ontario began this work several months ago. Only Quebec can decide what happens on its territory, ”added Sylvain Gaudreault.
In addition, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) yesterday concluded that belugas are now an endangered species. In Cacouna, work is stopped.
“This compromises the respect of a condition of Minister David Heurtel, that of the highest standards in the environment, and this is not acceptable. If Quebec applies the precautionary principle, the work must not be authorized again. The premiers of the Canadian provinces and Prime Minister Stephen Harper may say what they want, Quebec must decide on its own what is happening on its territory and we will be there to repeat it, ”concluded Sylvain Gaudreault.
