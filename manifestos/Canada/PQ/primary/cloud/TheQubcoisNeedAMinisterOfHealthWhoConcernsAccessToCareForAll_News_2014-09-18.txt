Québec– The MNA for Taillon and official opposition spokesperson for health and access to care, Diane Lamarre, and the MNA for Rosemont and spokesperson for social services, Jean-François Lisée, s &#39;worried about the shortcomings in health and social services, highlighted by the Québec Ombudsman in its report published this morning.
The Protector&#39;s report highlights several important problems in terms of equity in access to health care and social services, in particular with regard to the free access to certain care and drugs as well as the quality of the living environments offered. in mental health accommodation resources.
“It is very worrying and contrary to the principle of equity to know that all Quebecers do not have access to the same care in different regions, and that some pay for a drug while others receive it free of charge. In addition, in the field of health, four of the Protector&#39;s six recommendations concern people with mental health problems or cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer&#39;s disease. As the Parti Québécois had decided, priority must be given to a mental health policy. These vulnerable people are often incapable of defending themselves on their own. They deserve to be protected, ”said Diane Lamarre.
“When we talk about accommodation, the lack of support offered to people with intellectual or physical disabilities is simply absurd. Young people and adults are being forced to turn to CHSLDs, living environments that are totally inadequate for them. As for intermediate resources, the Protector underlines the lack of training and supervision of the professionals who work there; nothing to reassure us. Finally, with regard to home care, we share the Protector&#39;s great concern, which notes a lack of resources and breakdowns in services. This is unacceptable, and I reiterate that the Liberal government must come out of its lethargy and put the improvement of home care back on the agenda, ”added Jean-François Lisée.
