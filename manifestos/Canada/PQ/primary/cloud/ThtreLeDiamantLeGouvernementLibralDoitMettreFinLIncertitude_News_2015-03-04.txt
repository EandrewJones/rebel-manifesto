Québec– The MNA for Joliette and official opposition critic for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, as well as the MNA for Taschereau, parliamentary leader and spokesperson for the Capitale-Nationale region, Agnès Maltais , ask the Liberal government to put an end to the uncertainty surrounding the Théâtre Le Diamant issue.
“After the multiple cuts in the cultural sector, can Minister Hélène David go ahead for Le Diamant, as her predecessor, Christine St-Pierre, had committed to in 2012? In this period of liberal austerity, I would remind the Minister that investing in culture means investing in a sector that represents more than 4% of Quebec&#39;s GDP, ”declared Véronique Hivon.
“The people responsible for soliciting the private sector for the file are at a standstill. They want to work, but the uncertainty that hangs over the project is too great. There is a contract properly signed by the government, and it must be honored. The Prime Minister must honor this electoral promise he made to the citizens of the Capitale-Nationale region, ”added Agnès Maltais.
