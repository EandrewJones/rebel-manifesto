Quebec - We learn today that the average wait time on stretcher at the Saint-Jérôme Regional Hospital is one of the worst in Quebec. While the national average is 15.3 hours, the citizens of Saint-Jérôme wait 24.1 hours, which is almost 9 hours longer. Diane Lamarre, spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of health, access to care and home support, once again denounces the situation, which she describes as unacceptable.
“Even today in the emergency room of the Saint-Jérôme hospital, 14 people have been waiting on stretchers for at least 24 hours, and 6 for more than 48 hours! It is indecent. The citizens of Saint-Jérôme waited an average of 4:08 hours before even being able to see a doctor in the emergency room in 2015-2016, which is almost twice as long as the Quebec average, which is 2:18. impression that the government is not sensitive to the health situation in the Laurentians! », Denounced Diane Lamarre.
“Rather than improving patient services, as they promised to do, the Liberal Party has deteriorated them. However, the solutions are to be found before and after. Before, either on the front line, where specialized nurse practitioners could treat minor problems independently; and afterwards, with a real home support policy for vulnerable people. With centralization, cutbacks in services and increased physician remuneration, we have forgotten the patient, who is always the loser. The liberal candidate, Naömie Goyette, should apologize to the Jérômiens and Jérômiennes for this new failure of the Barrette reform, ”the spokesperson concluded.
