This amount represents the last payment to which the City is entitled under the memorandum of understanding signed with the Ministère de la Sécurité publique (MSP) for carrying out an analysis of solutions aimed at preventing and mitigating erosion risks. .
“Carrying out this analysis enables elected municipal officials to study the various avenues in order to make informed choices with regard to the risks on the territory, for the benefit of citizens. I would like to underline the excellent collaboration of the City of Port-Cartier, which made it possible to consider such a project and to contribute to proactively acting in civil protection, ”declared Minister Bergeron.
“The City of Port-Cartier has to deal with certain natural risks, in particular that of bank erosion. This is why planning and implementing sustainable and efficient solutions are essential to ensure a safer living environment for the community, ”added the Member for Duplessis.
According to the memorandum of understanding, the MSP undertakes to pay financial assistance equal to the eligible costs of the activities referred to in this memorandum, less a financial contribution fixed according to the demographic assessment.
