Quebec - The Minister for Tourism, Mr. Pascal Bérubé, is pleased to announce the allocation of financial assistance of $ 5,000 in support of the 9th edition of the Quebec City Arc-en-Ciel Festival.
From August 29 to September 2, the Saint-Jean-Baptiste district will be the scene of several artistic and community events to highlight the significant contribution of gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender people (GLBT) to the culture and influence of Quebec.
“In addition to contributing to the recognition and acceptance of diversity, the Fête Arc-en-ciel also contributes to the development of tourism in Quebec. I congratulate the organizers who are determined to make this event a meeting that attracts more and more participants each year, ”Minister Bérubé said.
The financial assistance granted by Tourisme Québec comes from the Tourism Industry Development Program - financial assistance for festivals and tourist events.
By funding festivals and events, the Government of Quebec supports the implementation of initiatives that contribute to the economic and cultural development of the regions of Quebec. It thus promotes the renewal of the tourist offer of the Capitale-Nationale in a perspective of continuous and sustainable improvement.
