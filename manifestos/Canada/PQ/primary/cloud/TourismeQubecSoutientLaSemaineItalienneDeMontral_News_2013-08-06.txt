Quebec - The Minister for Tourism, Pascal Bérubé, is pleased to announce the allocation of financial assistance of $ 20,000 in support of the Italian Week in Montreal, which will take place from August 9 to 18, 2013.
True immersion in the universe of the Italian community of Montreal, the 20th edition of this long-awaited event once again reflects the multicultural and welcoming character of Montrealers and highlights the know-how of the artisans of the metropolis.
Outdoor concerts, comedy and folklore shows, exhibitions, fashion show and opera are just a few of the activities of a rich and varied program that should appeal to people of all ages.
&quot;On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Italian Week in Montreal, I congratulate the organizers who have been able to highlight the cultural richness of the Italian community of Montreal in addition to contributing to the recognition of the metropolis as a top tourist destination&quot; , said Minister Bérubé.
The financial assistance granted by Tourisme Québec comes from the Tourism Industry Development Program - financial assistance for festivals and tourist events.
