Kuujjuaq– The Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, took advantage of her visit to Nunavik on September 12 and 13 to discuss issues related to telecommunications with local elected officials. She said she was determined to negotiate a financial partnership with the main players involved, namely the federal government and the Kativik Regional Government (KRG), in order to ensure efficient access to telecommunications networks. “This is an essential service for Nunavimmiut. In the digital age, access to an Internet service is essential, ”said Pauline Marois.
Thus, the Prime Minister mandated the President of the Treasury Board, Stéphane Bédard, to study possible solutions in telecommunications following the proposals made public by the KRG on September 12. These proposals could take over from the current agreement totaling $ 14.9 million over five years, funded to the tune of $ 7.4 million by Industry Canada, $ 3 million by the Ministry of Natural Resources, $ 2.5 million M $ by the KRG and, finally, $ 2 M by Telesat. A new financial partnership should be studied before the 2016 deadline.
The Prime Minister also mandated the Minister for Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs, the Canadian Francophonie and Sovereignty Governance, Alexandre Cloutier, to initiate discussions with the federal government on the issue of telecommunications in Nunavik.
“Access to an adequate telecommunications network adapted to the needs of the 21st century is vital for Nunavimmiut. The commitment the government is making today is encouraging and we look forward to starting discussions on this matter. The 2016 target must be reached, ”said Kativik Regional Government President Maggie Emudluk.
Remember that over the past 10 years, the KRG has made significant efforts to develop a reliable Internet network for businesses, organizations and residents of Nunavik. She founded the Tamaani Internet company, which provides wireless Internet access to 14 northern villages.
