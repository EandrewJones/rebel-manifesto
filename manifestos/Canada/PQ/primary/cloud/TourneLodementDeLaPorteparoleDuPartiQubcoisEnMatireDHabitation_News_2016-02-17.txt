Quebec– This week, the MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and Parti Québécois housing spokesperson, Carole Poirier, meets various housing organizations in Greater Montreal, as part of a tour on the theme of housing social.
“There are 6,000 authorized and financed housing units to build, and the Liberal government has decided to reduce from 3,000 to 1,500 the number of units that will be built in 2015-2016. Why block the development of so many units, when the needs are obvious? Why are so many units still waiting? What stage have these units reached? What are the major obstacles encountered by the groups? I&#39;m trying to understand, and I want to paint a clear picture of the social housing situation to show the Liberal government that it is on the wrong track, and that slowing down the development of community social housing in favor of the private sector is not the solution. Quite the contrary, ”declared Carole Poirier, after a meeting with two major groups in the housing sector gathered in Saint-Eustache.
The Member recalled that the AccèsLogis Québec program, which has been in existence since 1996, aims to promote the creation of social and community housing for low-income or low-income households, or for clients in difficulty with special needs. It is asking, among other things, that its annual funding, cut in half by the Liberal government, be fully restored.
Carole Poirier continues her tour of organizations until Sunday; she will also visit groups in Montérégie, the Laurentians and Gatineau.
