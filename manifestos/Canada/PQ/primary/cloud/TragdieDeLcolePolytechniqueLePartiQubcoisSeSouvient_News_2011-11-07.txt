Quebec - “On the occasion of the 22nd anniversary of the tragedy at École Polytechnique, the Parti Québécois would like to commemorate this event in memory of the 14 young women who were victims of an act still incomprehensible and unacceptable after all these years. This tragedy experienced by the families of the victims must not be forgotten and the struggles they subsequently waged must not be in vain, ”declared the MNA for Marguerite-D&#39;Youville and spokesperson for the official opposition. on the status of women, Monique Richard.
&quot;While all of Quebec is commemorating this tragedy, it is deplorable to note that the Government of Canada persists in wanting to abolish the firearms registry,&quot; added the member for Marie-Victorin and spokesperson for the official opposition in in Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Bernard Drainville.
It will be remembered that it was following the tragedy at École Polytechnique that an unprecedented mobilization led by relatives of the victims led the federal government to set up a firearms registry.
“Since 2006, the National Assembly of Quebec has adopted seven unanimous motions to demand the complete maintenance of the register and the protection of data from Quebec. The National Assembly asked the Quebec firearms controller to take all measures to protect the data. It is imperative that the data be preserved to protect the registry in Quebec. Faced with the intransigence of the Canadian government, the government of Quebec must take legal action to prevent the destruction of the data, ”concluded the member for Verchères and official opposition spokesperson for public security, Stéphane Bergeron.
