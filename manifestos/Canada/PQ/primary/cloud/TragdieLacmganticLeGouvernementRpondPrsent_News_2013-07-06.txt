All our thoughts are with the residents and families of Lac-Mégantic. The authorities are busy securing the sector and all the necessary resources are made available to them.
Moreover, the Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, quickly spoke with the mayoress of Lac-Mégantic to assure her of her support and that of the government of Quebec. Indeed, the government has been present from the start and is doing everything to help the population.
Dr. Réjean Hébert is currently on his way to Lac-Mégantic and he will speak to the media later today.
We will keep you informed of developments on our website and on the Party Québécois Facebook page.
