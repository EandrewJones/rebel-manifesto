Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu– The MNA for Iberville, Mrs. Marie Bouillé, as well as the MNA for Saint-Jean, Mr. Dave Turcotte, on behalf of the Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of the territory, Sylvain Gaudreault, are proud to announce financial assistance of $ 125,000 to the Agence métropolitaine de transport (AMT) to enable it to conduct a feasibility study for the implementation of a commuter train connecting Saint -Jean-sur-Richelieu in Montreal.
The Montreal region has a network of commuter trains that has developed over the past few years, ensuring the sustainable mobility of people. Thus, and considering the success of the commuter train service between Candiac and Montreal, several community stakeholders have requested that a feasibility study be launched for the construction of a line to Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu.
&quot;The feasibility study once again proves the Department&#39;s intentions, which are to make decisions taking into account sustainable development, which favors, among other things, the increase in public transit,&quot; said MP Dave Turcotte.
“This is a big step forward for the region,” adds MP Marie Bouillé. &quot;It is a sign that our efforts have borne fruit,&quot; she continues.
This feasibility study should start by 2014.
