Quebec - &quot;How was it possible to record a cost overrun of nearly half a billion dollars compared to the East Train project announced by Prime Minister Jean Charest in 2006 without anyone ringing the bell?&quot; alarm? &quot;
This is the question asked by the member for Gouin and official opposition spokesperson for transport, Nicolas Girard, after having read the new revelations published this morning in the daily La Presse. We learn that the initial project provided for an outlay of $ 300 million for the East train. However, according to the new estimates, the project is likely to cost more than double, or even nearly triple.
“There&#39;s someone out there who hasn&#39;t done their job properly. With this staggering overrun, it will cost taxpayers more than the extension of the metro in Laval, ”added Nicolas Girard.
Mont-Royal Tunnel: Minister Moreau must explain himself
On several occasions last fall, the member for Gouin questioned the Minister of Transport, Pierre Moreau, about the safety of the Mont-Royal tunnel, which has no emergency exit and is not equipped with any device in the event of an accident. &#39;fire. MP Girard requested an opinion from the fire department of the city of Montreal, which Minister Moreau refused.
“Minister Moreau maintained tooth and nail that there would be no compromise on the safety of citizens and users, but was not worried about the lack of an emergency exit. Now, we learned last December that the fire department of the city of Montreal sounded the alarm and is worried about this reality. Since he has had such an opinion in his hands for almost two months, Pierre Moreau must now tell us whether the tunnel is still as safe as it is, as he has repeatedly said to the National Assembly ”, concluded Nicolas Girard.
