New York, New York (United States) - La Prairie MP François Rebello pleaded this morning, in front of more than 200 American railway officials, for the development of an efficient link between Montreal and New York and more specifically for the establishment of a night train between the two metropolises.
“The development of a fast night train is more than ever a project for the future that will further strengthen our economic and commercial exchanges,” said François Rebello. The current travel time of the daytime train is over 11 hours between Montreal and New York, which is not conducive to tourist exchanges, while a night train could connect the two cities in less than 7 hours to a lower cost than the plane, ”he added.
The MP spoke this morning in New York at a conference on transportation development in the Americas, including former Congressman James Oberstar and the New State Senator York, Malcolm Smith. He stressed the importance of investing quickly in improving rail service between Quebec and the United States.
The Member for La Prairie traveled to New York at the invitation of the US High Speed Rail Association and participated as a speaker at the High Speed Rail Conference held from November 6 to 8, 2011. The US High Speed Rail Association is an organization whose mandate is to promote high speed rail in the United States.
