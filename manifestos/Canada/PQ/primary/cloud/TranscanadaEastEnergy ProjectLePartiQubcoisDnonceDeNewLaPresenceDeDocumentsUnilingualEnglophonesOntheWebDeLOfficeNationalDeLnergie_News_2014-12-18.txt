Quebec - Sylvain Gaudreault, the member for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development and the environment, as well as the member for Bourget and spokesperson responsible for the Charter of the French language, Maka Kotto, support the approach of the Center québécois du droit de l&#39;environnement and recall that the National Energy Board (NEB) must suspend the analysis of the Energy East project as long as the company TransCanada has not filed all the complete, updated and fully translated documents into French.
In Sylvain Gaudreault&#39;s eyes, it is crucial that Francophones be able to obtain, in their language, all the information on the TransCanada project, in order to fully understand the risks it involves in terms of water supply for local residents. agricultural land and human consumption, as well as the impacts of a possible environmental disaster on their territory. “The TransCanada Energy East pipeline project is already unacceptable due to the risks it poses to the environment; in addition, the company does not even respect francophones who could be affected, ”he declared.
The presence of documents in English only on the NEB&#39;s website has also been denounced by several groups dedicated to the environment and to the defense of the French language, including the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste. “It is unacceptable that the NEB can start studying the TransCanada project, when the documents it makes available to citizens do not respect the primacy of French in Quebec. This shows a flagrant lack of consideration for francophones. As long as the documents are not translated and Francophones cannot take part in the debate on an equal footing, the examination process must be suspended, ”claimed Maka Kotto. At the same time, the member added that all the files that TransCanada will submit to the BAPE must also be in French.
