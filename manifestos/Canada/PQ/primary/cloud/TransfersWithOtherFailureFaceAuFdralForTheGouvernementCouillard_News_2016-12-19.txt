Quebec, December 19, 2016 - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for finances and Quebec-Canada relations, Nicolas Marceau, notes another failure of the Couillard government against the Trudeau government, which refuses to maintain health transfers to a annual rate of 6%, without conditions.
The reduction to 3% in the growth of health transfers will cause Quebecers to lose $ 13.7 billion in 10 years.
“Today we have another proof of the failure of cooperative federalism advocated by the Prime Minister of Quebec, in addition to another confirmation that Justin Trudeau does nothing more than Stephen Harper for Quebecers; he has only the concern to take care of his image. While Philippe Couillard tries to be Ottawa&#39;s best friend, our patients wait and our elders suffer. Even if Minister Gaétan Barrette maintains Quebec&#39;s traditional position on transfers, the Trudeau government is not at all worried, knowing that it will always be able to count on the cooperation of Philippe Couillard, ”declared Nicolas Marceau.
“The federal government&#39;s unilateral refusal in the priority issue of health transfers demonstrates the limits of Quebec&#39;s powers in Canada. The question facing the Liberal Party and the CAQ is: what do you propose to get out of this impasse? So far, the answer is nothing at all, ”continued the spokesperson.
“If the Couillard government wants to make gains against Ottawa, it will have to learn to stand up, instead of seeking a good understanding at all costs. Gaétan Barrette has tried to harden his tone on several occasions, but it is clear that the Prime Minister refuses to fully support him. I invite Philippe Couillard to review his approach, to be inspired by the attitude of his Minister of Health in this particular issue, ”concluded Nicolas Marceau.
