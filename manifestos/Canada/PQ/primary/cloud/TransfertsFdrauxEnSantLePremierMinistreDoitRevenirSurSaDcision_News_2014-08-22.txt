Quebec - Diane Lamarre, MP for Taillon and official opposition spokesperson for health and access to care, and Stéphane Bergeron, MP for Verchères and spokesperson for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, denounce Prime Minister Philippe Couillard&#39;s intention to agree unansweredly to the future decline in federal health transfers. However, this acceptance represents billions of dollars less for Quebec&#39;s public finances.
“The changes proposed by Ottawa with regard to federal transfers mean the loss of more than $ 9 billion over 10 years for Quebec&#39;s finances. While the government is making budget cuts, which have been denounced by the health network, this decision is unacceptable. Philippe Couillard must come to the defense of Quebecers in this matter. How will the government justify this $ 9 billion shortfall over the next 10 years? What services will no longer be provided to patients, those who already suffer from a glaring lack of access and who are exposed to announced cuts? », Asked Diane Lamarre.
Let us recall that even Jean Charest, during a speech delivered to the Canadian Medical Association, denounced Ottawa in this matter, reproaching it for its lack of dialogue. In fact, since the federal decision was known, that is since 2011, all the premiers and finance ministers of Quebec have denounced this situation, except Philippe Couillard, who endorses it.
“Premier Couillard accepts what even Jean Charest denounced. With Ottawa&#39;s decision, the federal government&#39;s share of health care costs will drop below 20%, compared to the 50% it originally represented. Are we to understand that resignation and the refusal to ask will be the new way of doing things and the new policy of the Liberal government vis-à-vis the federal government? It is a decision that will cost Quebeckers dearly. Where will Philippe Couillard go to get this money left in Ottawa? Will he raise taxes? », Added Stéphane Bergeron.
