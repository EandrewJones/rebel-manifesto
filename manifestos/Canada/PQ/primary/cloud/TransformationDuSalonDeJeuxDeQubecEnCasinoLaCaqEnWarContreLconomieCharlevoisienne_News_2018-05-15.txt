The member for Taschereau and official opposition spokesperson responsible for the Capitale-Nationale region, Agnès Maltais, fiercely denounces the Coalition Avenir Québec&#39;s desire to transform the Salon de jeux de Québec into a casino.
IN SHORT
“The CAQ proposes to transform the Salon de jeux de Québec into a casino; this very bad idea is a frontal attack on the economic vitality of the Charlevoix region. There is already a casino in the Capitale-Nationale region, and it is in Charlevoix. In no case should this change. Charlevoix is an economy already weakened by the centralization of jobs in the public service operated by the Liberals. For the Parti Québécois, there is no question of opening a casino in Quebec; rather, we are relying on the complementarity of the tourist offer ”, declared Agnès Maltais straight away.
“The people of the Capitale-Nationale now know that the CAQ is proposing to jeopardize the 250 good jobs at the Casino de Charlevoix. This proposal clearly shows that it has no vision for the regions and their economic development. That for her, it is secondary, as for the Liberals. Charlevoix is an incredible tourist region that enjoys an enviable reputation, and its casino is one of its main tourist attractions. The opening of a casino in Quebec would be resolutely harmful for its economy and its population, ”concluded the MP.
