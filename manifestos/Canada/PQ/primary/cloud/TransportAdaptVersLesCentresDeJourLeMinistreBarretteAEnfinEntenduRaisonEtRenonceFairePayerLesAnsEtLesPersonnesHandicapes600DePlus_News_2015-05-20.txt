Quebec– The MNA for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, Jean-François Lisée, and the MNA for Richelieu and spokesperson for seniors, Sylvain Rochon, are satisfied that the Minister of Health and Social Services, Gaétan Barrette, accepted the Parti Québécois&#39; request to cancel the drastic increase in the cost of paratransit service for seniors and people with disabilities attending day centers.
“For some people, the increases were as high as 600% and represented costs of $ 1,000 per year. Even though the minister called it an &quot;adjustment?&quot; It was an absolutely disproportionate and unjustifiable increase. For the vast majority of seniors and people with disabilities, $ 1,000 is simply too expensive. &#39;there was no other solution than to give up these totally unfair increases, ”said Jean-François Lisée.
“First the CHSLDs, then the pricing of day centers: for the second time in as many weeks, Minister Barrette is forced to give up increasing rates affecting seniors. This is excellent news, but we will nonetheless be monitoring the Minister closely to ensure that he does live up to his Prime Minister&#39;s commitment not to raise taxes and tariffs beyond inflation ” , added Sylvain Rochon.
The member for Rosemont also pointed out that seniors and people with disabilities did not have to pay the price for the government&#39;s obsession with balanced budgets. “The government has made the political choice to significantly increase doctors&#39; salaries, and it must assume it. Quebec patients do not have to undergo a tariff shock to compensate for a shortfall caused by its mismanagement of public finances, ”he concluded.
