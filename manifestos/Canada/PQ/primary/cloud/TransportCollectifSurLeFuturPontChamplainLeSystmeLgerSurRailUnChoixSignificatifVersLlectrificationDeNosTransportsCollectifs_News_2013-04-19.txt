Montreal - The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, accompanied by the Minister of International Relations, La Francophonie and Foreign Trade and Minister responsible for the Montreal region, Mr. Jean-François Lisée, the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports and Minister responsible for the Montérégie region, Ms. Marie Malavoy, and the President and CEO of the Agence métropolitaine de transport (AMT) , Mr. Nicolas Girard, announces the choice of the Government of Quebec regarding the preferred mode of public transport on the future Champlain Bridge.
“The government&#39;s choice is the Light Rail System (SLR). This is part of this vision of the future of transport in the 21st century. The latter is embodied by the transport electrification project launched by the Premier of Quebec, Ms. Pauline Marois. In addition, the SLR is in line with our guidelines for the environment, urban planning and economic development. It makes it possible to respond to the challenges posed by demographic growth and sustainable development. Powered by electricity, it is an ecological mode of transport that has the capacity to meet current and future needs in this strategic area, which is already in great demand, ”declared Minister Gaudreault.
The Champlain Bridge is an essential link for the economic development of Quebec and the metropolis and its reconstruction represents an ideal opportunity to put forward a responsible, sustainable and innovative choice in public transit. It offers efficient, fast, safe and reliable service, integrates into the urban environment and serves a large number of customers while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
