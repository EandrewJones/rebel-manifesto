Québec - Martine Ouellet, MP for Vachon and official opposition critic for transport, transportation electrification and maritime strategy, and MP for Verchères and spokesperson for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Stéphane Bergeron, say they are very worried about the state of the railroad used, in recent weeks, by convoys transporting hazardous materials on the South Shore of Montreal.
Indeed, associations and mayors of the region claim that the South Shore railway is in a deplorable state. In addition, the media also told us that three million liters of oil have been circulating on these rails every day for a month now.
It is useful to remember that the operator of the railway in question, CN, is judge and party in the case since it is solely responsible for the inspections. Although CN tries to be reassuring, it is perfectly legitimate for the people of the region to be concerned about the situation and to demand more information.
“The citizens and elected officials of the region are worried, with good reason. Transport Canada is to send inspectors to the scene. What explains this increase in the circulation of oil on the South Shore railway? Is it temporary or permanent? How long will it take for CN to complete its work? Considering the poor condition of the rails and the increase in traffic, Transport Canada must inform citizens and elected officials of the measures that have been taken to ensure the safety of the inhabitants of the region, ”said Martine Ouellet.
“Transport Canada must be very vigilant when it comes to the transportation of dangerous materials, which saw its work severely criticized this week in the Transportation Safety Board&#39;s report following the terrible tragedy in Lac-Mégantic. To hope to regain the confidence of Quebecers, Transport Canada must be perfectly exemplary, which sometimes means doing much more than what the basic rules prescribe, ”added Stéphane Bergeron.
