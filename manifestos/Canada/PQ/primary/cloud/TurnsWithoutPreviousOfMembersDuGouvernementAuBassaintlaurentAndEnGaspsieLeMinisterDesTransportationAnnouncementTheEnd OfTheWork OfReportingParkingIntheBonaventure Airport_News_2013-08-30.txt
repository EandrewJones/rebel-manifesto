Quebec - On the occasion of an unprecedented tour of members of the Government of Quebec in the Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspésie region, the Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Occupation of territory, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, is pleased to announce that the extension work on the parking lot at Bonaventure Airport is now complete.
The work carried out over the past two years represents a total investment of around $ 317,000. The significant increase in ridership at the Bonaventure airport, in particular through the numerous trips to the north shore, necessitated the availability of a long-term parking area. Indeed, the number of trips between 2011 and 2012 has more than doubled. The new parking lot has grown from 29 to 82 spaces.
“Bonaventure Airport represents an important link for the region&#39;s economic and social development. These modern airport infrastructure works make it possible to better meet the needs of travelers, ”said Mr. Gaudreault.
For his part, the MNA for Bonaventure, Mr. Sylvain Roy, is pleased with the accomplishment of this work, in particular the improvements concerning the lighting and the parking markings for motor vehicles. These will ensure increased safety of movement on the airport site.
&quot;These investments have made it possible to optimize the major asset that is the airport for the region,&quot; concluded the Minister for the Regions and Minister responsible for the Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine region, Mr. Gaétan Lelièvre.
Recall that members of the Parti Québécois and government ministers met on August 28 and 29 in Carleton-sur-Mer for the caucus of deputies and the Council of Ministers.
