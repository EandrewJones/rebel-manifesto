Quebec - The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, congratulates directors Jean-Marc Vallée and Denis Villeneuve on the nomination of their respective works for the 2014 edition of the Oscars, an event which rewards the excellence of world cinema productions .
“To be nominated for an Oscar is to take a giant leap forward in terms of recognizing your talent. I warmly congratulate Jean-Marc Vallée and Denis Villeneuve who, by making themselves known in this way, deserve all our admiration and see their careers take a major step forward. By the time the two filmmakers will tread the red carpet, all of Quebec cinema will walk with them, ”said the Minister.
Director Jean-Marc Vallée obtains a total of six nominations for his film Dallas Buyers Club. He is nominated among others for the feature film of the year, the most prestigious category. It is a first for Quebec that one of its filmmakers is in the running for this award, especially since the film was produced on a tight budget. This sizeable challenge says a lot about Jean-Marc Vallée&#39;s talent for leading his team and making his project a high-quality work, comparable to major American productions.
Minister Kotto also salutes director Denis Villeneuve, whose film Prisoners obtains a nomination in the category of best cinematography. Remember that this is the second Oscar participation for the filmmaker who was nominated in 2011, in the category of best foreign language film, for his feature film Incendies.
The 86th Academy Awards will take place on Sunday, March 2, at the Dolby Theater, Hollywood. It will be broadcast live in 225 countries.
