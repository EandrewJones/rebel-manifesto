Quebec - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of transport, maritime strategy, electrification of transport and telecommunications, Martine Ouellet, asks the new Minister of Transport, Jacques Daoust, to go further than his predecessor by making cease the activities of the illegal taxi service UberX.
“During his tenure, Robert Poëti repeatedly declared that the UberX service was illegal. Minister Daoust must go beyond words and put an end to illegal taxi activities. Tension is mounting in the industry, the drivers are at the end of their patience and the Couillard government has abandoned them. In what other industry are illegal activities carried out in broad daylight tolerated? Minister Daoust must do more than denounce; he must stop the UberX service once and for all, to prevent the situation from escalating, ”said Martine Ouellet.
Indeed, it is illogical that, on the one hand, the government requires taxi drivers to hold a license worth several tens of thousands of dollars while, on the other hand, it tolerates certain people to offer the same service. without having a permit. This competition is not only unfair, it also turns out to be against the law.
“It is not normal that workers are forced to take legal steps to enforce Quebec laws. Industry is modernizing at high speed; several taxi companies have developed technological platforms that are just as efficient as that of UberX. The problem is not the technology, it is the illegal taxi activities. Worse, UberX encourages honest citizens to become illegals. The government must protect taxi drivers and their families, ”concluded Martine Ouellet.
