Quebec– For several weeks, the member for Vachon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in transport, Martine Ouellet, has been urging the Minister of Transport, Jacques Daoust, to table a bill to regulate UberX services. Today in the House, she demanded that he act by May 15, the deadline for passing a bill before the end of this parliamentary session. Until now, however, the minister has refused to make a commitment in this direction.
“On the ground, the situation is deteriorating. Every day that passes without a bill allows UberX to continue its illegal activities. The minister has had enough time. He must table his bill to ban illegal taxis by May 15 at the latest. It is a question of justice and fairness: all taxi services must be subject to the same rules. Why would there be a special regime for UberX, and another for taxis? The minister has no more excuses; like his predecessor, Jacques Daoust has repeated on several occasions that he intended to introduce a bill. Why wait? », Asked Martine Ouellet.
“The file has been studied for two years. We have worked extensively on the regulation of the taxi industry and the Parti Québécois even proposed a bill to counter illegal taxis. Two consultations have already been carried out: one in the summer of 2014, and another this spring. Minister Jacques Daoust has all the information he can dream of. He also repeated that he was doing everything to file on time, but he refused to speak of May 15. However, he must act, and quickly, ”concluded the member for the Parti Québécois.
