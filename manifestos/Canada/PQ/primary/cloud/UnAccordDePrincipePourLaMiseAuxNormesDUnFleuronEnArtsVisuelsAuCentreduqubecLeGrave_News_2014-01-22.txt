Victoriaville - The Minister of Culture and Communications, Maka Kotto, announces an agreement in principle of $ 613,400 for the upgrading of the place housing the Groupement des arts visuels (GRAVE), in Victoriaville.
“These improvements will enhance the quality of exhibits presented and the dissemination of exhibits focused on new technologies. In addition, upgrading will ensure benefits for the future of the centre&#39;s activities, its anchoring in the community and, in particular, on the visibility of visual artists from all disciplines, ”declared Minister Maka Kotto.
At the end of the works, the GRAVE will be able to offer an adequate place of creation to the artists of the region, to ensure the safety of the artists in residence at the GRAVE, to improve the exhibition spaces and to allow the circulation of works of visual art. The upgrading will make GRAVE a place of choice to offer regional and national visibility to visual artists.
“GRAVE has adopted an approach in accordance with that of the city that hosts it, namely the promotion of sustainable development. For artists from Center-du-Québec, the center opens a door to the exploration of practices between recycling, recovery and contemporary art. This is another avenue for establishing dialogue and synergy between artists and their community, ”Minister Kotto concluded.
