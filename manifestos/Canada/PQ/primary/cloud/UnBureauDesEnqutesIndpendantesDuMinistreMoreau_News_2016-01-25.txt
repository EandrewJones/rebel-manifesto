Quebec - Reacting to the revelations of Minister Pierre Moreau&#39;s interference in the process of appointment to the Bureau of Independent Investigations (BEI), the Parti Québécois spokesperson for public security, Pascal Bérubé, sharply denounces the minister&#39;s attitude, which blocks the appointment of independent candidates, guarantors of parity between police and civilians within the BEI.
“The Liberals are perverting the very nature of the Bureau of Independent Investigations, which was to be based on parity between police and civilians. This parity is essential to the credibility of the EIB as a truly independent body. Why is Pierre Moreau blocking nominations? », Asked Pascal Bérubé.
According to the law creating the BEI, adopted by the Parti Québécois government, &quot;investigators are appointed on the recommendation of the director of the Bureau&quot;, and the latter &quot;promotes parity between investigators who have never been peace officers and those who have never been peace officers. who have already been ”.
“Minister Moreau has no valid reason to block the recommendations of the director of the BEI. He must explain why he is opposed to the appointment of independent investigators to the Office of Independent Investigations. In whose interest is he doing this? It is certainly not in that of Quebecers, ”continued Mr. Bérubé.
Let us recall that last week, Pierre Moreau, on the eve of an announced cabinet reshuffle, took advantage of the absence of his Prime Minister to propose the creation of a ministry tailor-made for him, bringing together Public Security and the Municipal affairs.
“From week to week, we discover that instead of working for Quebecers, Pierre Moreau works first and foremost for Pierre Moreau,” concluded the member for Matane-Matapédia.
