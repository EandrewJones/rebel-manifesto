Dolbeau-Mistassini– The Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, accompanied by the Minister of Natural Resources, Martine Ouellet, and her parliamentary assistant for forestry issues, Denis Trottier, announced an investment of 8.5 M $ to carry out silvicultural projects and to harvest wood affected by insects or by forest fires in the summer of 2013.
“This support for forestry employment across Quebec is made possible by the addition of an envelope of $ 5 million and by the reallocation of $ 3.5 million for carrying out priority forestry projects, starting this fall. This investment will make it possible to carry out non-commercial silvicultural work, partial cutting, particularly in the deciduous forest, and special plans for the recovery of wood damaged in the summer of 2013 by insects or by forest fires. In addition, given the late date for the completion of several works, unspent budgets may be carried over to next season, ”said the Prime Minister.
“The forestry sector is one of Quebec&#39;s main economic engines. It is all the more so for a resource region like ours. Today&#39;s announcement will result in an additional investment of more than $ 2.2 million in our region, in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, ”explained Roberval MNA Denis Trottier.
“Forestry will be at the heart of the discussions at the next Rendez-vous de la forêt québécoise. Our forest offers very interesting prospects for economic development that will benefit all Quebecers. It is together that we will be able to find possible solutions to maximize the forest lands that we have chosen to develop while respecting the environment, and to create wealth for Quebec and all its regions, ”concluded the Minister. Martine Ouellet.
