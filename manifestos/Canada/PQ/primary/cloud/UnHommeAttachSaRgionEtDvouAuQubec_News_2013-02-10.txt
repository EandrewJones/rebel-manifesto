Drummondville - The Premier of Quebec, Ms. Pauline Marois, paid tribute to Mr. Gérard Asselin, who died yesterday in Quebec. “Gérard Asselin was a man attached to his region, the Côte-Nord, and devoted to Quebec. After 14 years in municipal politics and 18 years in federal politics, he devoted a significant part of his life to serving his fellow citizens. &quot;
Member of Parliament for Charlevoix and then for Manicouagan, Mr. Asselin will have greatly contributed to the success of the Bloc Québécois. &quot;We will recall that Gérard Asselin participated in the first sovereignist official opposition in the House of Commons, in 1993,&quot; added the Prime Minister.
On behalf of the entire government team, the Premier offers her most sincere condolences to the relatives and friends of Gérard Asselin.
