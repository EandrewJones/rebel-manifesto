Quebec - The Minister for Native Affairs, Ms. Élizabeth Larouche, today took part in the canonization ceremony of Kateri Tekakwitha, the first Native American to achieve the rank of saint.
Ms. Larouche said she was very moved following the ceremony: &quot;I had the chance to live a moment not only historic, but also full of emotions,&quot; said the Minister.
In the company of several dignitaries as well as thousands of pilgrims from Quebec and elsewhere in the world, Ms. Larouche was able to attend this event awaited by many Native Catholics who have great admiration for the new saint.
Born in the United States, Kateri Tekakwitha (1656-1680) lived part of her life in New France. His tomb is on display in Kahnawake.
“Saint Kateri Tekakwitha touches us all in some way. The recognition she received today allowed us to come together around a common reference, ”added Ms. Larouche.
During her stay in Rome, Ms. Larouche met with the Grand Chief of the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake, Michael Delisle, as well as chiefs and other representatives of the First Nations. After the canonization ceremony, the minister had a brief interview with Pope Benedict XVI.
