“The action plan foresees that it will take 5 to 10 years to restore confidence. However, there is an administrative investigation into the SPVM in progress. When we have the conclusions of this investigation, will the action plan be modified based on the recommendations? The sequence is rather surprising; we must conclude that this action plan is provisional. It would have been more logical to put the service under supervision, the time for the administrative investigation to shed light and for it to present its recommendations, ”said Pascal Bérubé.

Moreover, I am very surprised to see that the first major municipal police force in Quebec is promising results to the population in just 10 years, ”added the deputy.
“The Minister of Public Security learned of the action plan at the start of the week, which surprised everyone. Can we have the same explanations he received? The Parti Québécois is asking that the action plan be presented to elected members of the National Assembly during a parliamentary committee, ”concluded Pascal Bérubé.
