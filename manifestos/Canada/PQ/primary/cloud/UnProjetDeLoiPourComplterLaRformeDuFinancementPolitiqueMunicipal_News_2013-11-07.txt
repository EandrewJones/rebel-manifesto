Quebec - The Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, today tabled in the National Assembly a bill to complete the reform of municipal political financing undertaken with Bill 26.
“The government continues to act on integrity by introducing a new bill to counter illegal financing and encourage democratic exercise. If adopted, it will promote the independence of political parties and independent candidates from private contributors through increased public funding while allowing them to have sufficient resources. In the end, it is the public&#39;s confidence in elected officials and political financing that will be strengthened by this reform, ”declared Minister Gaudreault.
Concretely, the new measures:
The new measures complement those introduced by Bill 26, which aimed to establish a temporary municipal political financing regime in the context of the 2013 municipal elections. This bill as well as Bill 2, on financing provincial policy, were adopted unanimously by the National Assembly.
It should be remembered that the measures proposed in the bill were the subject of public consultations. The consultation report is available on the Ministère&#39;s website atwww.mamrot.gouv.qc.ca.
