Quebec - The member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and spokesperson for elementary and secondary education, Nicole Léger, as well as the member for Terrebonne and spokesperson word in matters of family, Mathieu Traversy, ask the Prime Minister, Philippe Couillard, to proceed quickly with a cabinet reshuffle, in the interest of the families of Quebec.
“Obviously, Quebec families are poorly served by the Ministers of Education, Yves Bolduc, and of the Family, Francine Charbonneau. These two ministers have made more mistakes in recent months. The farce has gone on long enough; they must be replaced. This is a flagrant admission of failure for the government, but the interests of families must come first, ”declared Stéphane Bédard.
A rough minister, who improvises and adds up the burrs
“Yves Bolduc has shown on numerous occasions that he is out of place at the Ministry of Education. Between his $ 215,000 bonus that he refuses to reimburse in full, his statement on the purchase of books, his cuts in direct services to students and his new school board card without tail or head, he has lost all credibility necessary to be at the head of this important ministry. He must leave, ”added Nicole Léger.
A minister who betrays families
“Francine Charbonneau accumulates bad decisions and broken promises. After having imposed a family tax on the middle class, stopped the development of childcare spaces, cut support for disadvantaged communities and children with special needs, she now wants to punish parents who strive to find a place for their children. She does not listen to parents or network partners; she alienated everyone. It no longer has any legitimacy, because it has failed all along the line. It must give up its place, ”concluded the member for Terrebonne.
