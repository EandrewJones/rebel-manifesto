Quebec - The Premier and Minister responsible for youth issues, Pauline Marois, is proud to announce the financial support of the Government of Quebec to the organization ENSEMBLE for the respect of diversity. An amount of $ 25,000 financed by the Youth Secretariat will thus be devoted to carrying out the Les Caravanes de la Tolerance 15-17 project.
The organization&#39;s mission is to make young people aware of respect for differences and to invite them to take part in the dialogue aimed at building an environment free from discrimination and bullying. The 15-17 Tolerance Caravans are an interactive workshop that offers students in Secondary 3, 4 and 5 a critical reflection on discrimination, prejudices and stereotypes according to the form they take and the consequences they can lead to. Based on the point of view and experience of young people, two facilitators who are experts in this field create a space for dialogue where pupils can explore common prejudices and their origins. A discussion then begins to understand how preconceived ideas sometimes translate into acts of discrimination and how, in turn, the Charter of human rights and freedoms can enable us to assert our rights.
“We are proud to contribute to this project which aims to curb bullying among young people. This funding will allow the organization to pursue its objectives and make young people more aware of the inherent dangers of discrimination in all its forms, ”said Pauline Marois.
Each year, ten regions of Quebec are approached by Les Caravanes de la Tolerance 15 17. Since 2010, nearly 30,000 young people have learned about the issues related to different forms of discrimination. This project will contribute to the implementation of the Diversity Challenge of the Youth Action Strategy 2009-2014.
