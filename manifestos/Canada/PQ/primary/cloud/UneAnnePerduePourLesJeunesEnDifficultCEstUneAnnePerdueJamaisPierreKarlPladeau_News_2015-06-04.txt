Quebec - Today during question period, the member for Saint-Jérôme and leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, asked Premier Philippe Couillard to stop cutting student services, because these cuts are in no way justified.
“A lost year, for young people in difficulty, it is a lost year forever; the damage is irreparable. The Prime Minister must pull himself together and rectify the situation while there is still time, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
The leader of the official opposition recalled the words of Michel Perron, a Quebec authority on school perseverance, who fears that more young people drop out of school because of the cuts imposed by the government.
“Today, we learn that the marks of students in difficulty, at the Commission scolaire de Laval, are inflated, because we have generalized the use of report cards with lowered requirements. So, as if by magic, the pass rate increases, justifying the removal of 12 specialized classes, as the government orders. Does the Prime Minister approve of the use of this level-to-the-bottom ploy to legitimize the indiscriminate cuts by his Minister of Education? “Asked Pierre Karl Péladeau.
The leader of the official opposition also denounced the cuts made to student services. “In Mauricie, the government is ending the Respite-Transit program, which helped students with behavioral problems; six education professionals fall by the wayside. An expert in school adaptation, Égide Royer, goes so far as to compare the situation with three years of interruption of vaccination campaigns. Why cut the services offered to the most vulnerable? », He concluded.
