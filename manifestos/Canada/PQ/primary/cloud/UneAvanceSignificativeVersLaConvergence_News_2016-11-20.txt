Quebec, November 20, 2016 - Véronique Hivon, Member of Parliament for Joliette and in charge of relations with civil society, citizen participation and convergence for the Parti Québécois, is delighted with the decision taken by the members of Quebec solidaire (QS ) to take a further step towards the convergence of progressive and sovereignist forces.
“We are pleased to note that the members of Québec solidaire have chosen to maintain their involvement in the United Organizations for Independence, the OUI Québec, a place of discussion and work that brings together all the forces of independence. The work we started together last winter is promising and we look forward to continuing it. On the other hand, the openness demonstrated by QS by setting up a major project on the possibility of convergence and alliances, including the idea of joint candidacies, constitutes a gesture of great importance for the to come up. This favorable response to the invitation launched by Jean-François Lisée and by many progressives shows that, little by little, we are moving in a promising direction. While respecting our differences, more and more Quebeckers are joining together behind the objective of ousting the most toxic Liberal government in our history, ”explained the member.
The Parti Québécois reiterates its willingness to work on the reform of the voting system and that of discussing the issues that appear to be priorities for Québec solidaire. The points of convergence between the program that the Parti Québécois is developing and the ideas promoted by Québec solidaire, as well as the social movements, will allow us to have a constructive discussion in the months which separate us from the election of 2018.
“Each gesture of rapprochement is a significant gesture towards convergence, from the most modest to the most ambitious. In itself, it is representative of a real desire for commitment, while learning to work together, ”concluded Véronique Hivon.
