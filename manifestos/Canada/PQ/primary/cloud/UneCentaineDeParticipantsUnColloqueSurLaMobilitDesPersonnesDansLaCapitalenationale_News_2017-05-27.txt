Quebec— Yesterday, around 100 people took part in the symposium on the mobility of people organized by the Parti Québécois de la Capitale-Nationale. The objective of this free, non-partisan event was to share knowledge on transportation issues and initiate a citizen discussion based on facts.
The conference gave rise to very rich exchanges and allowed the expression of divergent, even contradictory points of view. Two consensuses nevertheless emerged very clearly:
“The debates about transportation have been very emotional over the past few months. This is correct, but that cannot be enough, recalled the regional president of the Parti Québécois, Mr. Clément Laberge. We must also ensure that the debates are based on quality information. Everyone can then form a more informed opinion. I am happy that the Parti Québécois was able to contribute to this objective by organizing this event. ”
“We must not forget that public transport is an essential element in the development of a region. It is an important source of collective enrichment. We must choose based on the long term, bearing in mind that a transport system must be designed for 50 to 100 years, summarized Agnès Maltais. ”
