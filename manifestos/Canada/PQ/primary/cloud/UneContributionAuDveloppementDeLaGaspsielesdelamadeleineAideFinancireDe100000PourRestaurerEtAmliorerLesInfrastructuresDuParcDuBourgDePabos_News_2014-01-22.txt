Chandler– The Minister for the Regions, Minister responsible for the Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine region and Member for the riding of Gaspé, Mr. Gaétan Lelièvre, accompanied by the Member for Bonaventure and Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Sustainable Development, of the Environment, Wildlife and Parks (wildlife and parks component), Mr. Sylvain Roy, announced financial assistance of $ 100,000 to restore and improve the camping infrastructure of Parc du Bourg de Pabos. Financial assistance comes from the Regional Initiatives Assistance Fund (FAIR).
Since the installation of a pedestrian bridge by the City of Chandler, the Parc du Bourg de Pabos has seen its traffic increase. In fact, the rental of sites on the campsite more than doubled between 2006 and 2012 to reach 3870 overnight stays. In order to consolidate the recreational tourism offer in the park, the campsite facilities must be restored, in particular by expanding the playgrounds, building a children&#39;s recreation park and restoring parking and rest areas.
“I am delighted with the announcement today of this contribution which will help support the recreational tourism offer of the Parc du Bourg de Pabos. This great initiative will help stimulate the development of the Rocher Percé RCM, ”said the Minister.
The Regional Initiatives Assistance Fund aims to support the government intervention strategy for the development of the Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine region and is a major lever intended to promote, in particular, the implementation of projects resulting from development priorities of the region. A maximum annual envelope of $ 6 million is provided for this fund for a period of five years. The program is in effect until March 31, 2018.
