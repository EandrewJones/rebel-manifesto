The expansion of the building planned by the club will allow it to fit out a new locker room for snowmobilers with more storage space and install a new access ramp for people with disabilities. In addition, the club will have to redo the roof for the expansion portion, relocate the kitchen and touch up the seating and dining areas. He will also have to change the floor covering and redo the paint after the work.
“The Linière-Marlow Snowmobile Club is the one and only snowmobile gateway for American tourists and that justifies this financial assistance. The work will ensure the sustainability of the club by improving the quality and reception of tourists at the border crossing, ”said Minister Maltais.
It should be noted that the FCD aims to support initiatives which contribute in particular to economic, social, cultural, tourist, environmental and technological development and which could not be achieved without its contribution.
