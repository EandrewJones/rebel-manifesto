Saint-Jacques-le-Mineur– The Minister for the Regions, Minister responsible for the Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine region and Member of Parliament for the riding of Gaspé, Mr. Gaétan Lelièvre, announces the granting of aid funding of $ 400,500 to the Municipality of Saint-Jacques-le-Mineur to support the deployment of a high-speed Internet network (HSI) on its territory as part of the Communities rural branched program.
“It is with pride that I announce this important contribution from the Government of Quebec, which will stimulate the economic, social and cultural development of the Municipality while strengthening its power of attraction. Ultimately, the realization of this project will allow local citizens to connect with the world, ”said Minister Lelièvre.
The project consists of setting up IHV telecommunications infrastructures in areas not yet covered in order to increase the coverage rate of this territory to 100%. Funding for this project, estimated at more than $ 1 million, will be completed by Déry Télécom, which will remain the owner of the telecommunications infrastructure deployed.
“Our government reiterates its desire to offer all citizens of Quebec a high-speed Internet connection so that they can count on this indispensable tool in today&#39;s world, where knowledge and information and communications technologies play an increasingly strategic role in the socio-economic development of rural areas, ”added the Minister.
Stemming from the 2007-2014 National Policy on Rurality, the Branched Rural Communities program aims to support local projects intended to provide rural communities with HSI service of similar quality and at a cost comparable to that offered in urban areas.
