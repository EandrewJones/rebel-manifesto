New Richmond– The Minister for the Regions, Minister responsible for the Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine region and Member of Parliament for the riding of Gaspé, Mr. Gaétan Lelièvre, is pleased to announce the granting of financial assistance of $ 20,881 to the company Gaspésie Gourmande in order to improve the quality of the tourism offer of its organization and to lay the foundations for setting up a regional network for collective marketing of Gaspé biofood products.
Initially, the company will receive a sum of $ 5,000 to improve the tourist offer. To do this, Gaspésie Gourmande will notably offer personalized follow-up and individual and collective support for the implementation and monitoring of specifications for its members. The organization will also see to support certain investments of member companies so that they comply with the requirements of this guide.
With additional assistance of $ 15,881, Gaspésie Gourmande will assess the feasibility and profitability of a regional network for the marketing of Gaspé biofood products. The creation of such a network would make these products accessible to as many people as possible, both in the region and in major centers.

“Our government is proud to support this organization which participates in the development, marketing and promotion of Gaspé products, both on our territory and outside. This support demonstrates our desire to help businesses promote economic activity in the region, ”said Lelièvre.
The announced financial assistance comes from the Regional Strategic Intervention Fund.
