Grande-Rivière– The Minister for the Regions, Minister responsible for the Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine region and Member of Parliament for the riding of Gaspé, Mr. Gaétan Lelièvre, is pleased to announce the granting of assistance grant of $ 26,254 to Ateliers Actibec 2000 inc. for the development of a flexible and efficient global production system which will notably make it possible to reduce lead times and increase its manufacturing capacity.
To do this, the company will carry out redevelopment work on the interior and exterior of the building, including leveling the land for the transport and shipping of raw materials and the expansion of the warehouse used for bundles of paper. In addition to improving the company&#39;s productivity, this work will consolidate 70 jobs and create 8 more.
&quot;Our government is proud to support this social economy enterprise which, while contributing significantly to the economic development of the region, promotes the development and integration into the labor market of people with physical or intellectual limitations&quot;, indicated M. Lelièvre.
The announced financial assistance comes from the Regional Strategic Intervention Fund.
