Mont-Joli– The Minister for Tourism, Minister responsible for the Bas-Saint-Laurent region and Member of Parliament for Matane-Matapédia, Mr. Pascal Bérubé, on behalf of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Sylvain Gaudreault, announces the granting of financial assistance of $ 124,546 to the MRC de La Mitis to ensure fire safety protection for residents of the parishes of Sainte-Jeanne-d&#39;Arc and La Rédemption.
The financial assistance granted will allow the MRC de La Mitis to increase its strike force by acquiring a new tanker truck with a capacity of 10,000 liters for the fire safety service of La Rédemption. It should be remembered that the tanker truck which had been used until now had to be taken out of service due to major defects. This acquisition is therefore necessary to ensure adequate protection of the territory, particularly in areas that are not served by the water network. This project, which requires investments of $ 249,093, complies with the MRC&#39;s fire safety risk coverage plan.
“Our government cares about the future of the regions and the people who live there, and that is why we have made the dynamic occupation of the territories a priority. By ensuring the safety of the population of the parishes of Sainte-Jeanne-d&#39;Arc and La Rédemption, we reiterate our desire to support rural municipalities and to offer essential services to all Quebecers, ”said Minister Bérubé.
Financial assistance comes from the Support Fund for Territories in Difficulty, which is part of the government action plan for municipalities. This fund has five components, one of which is intended to finance the purchase of equipment enabling municipalities to comply with government standards, particularly in terms of the environment and fire safety.
