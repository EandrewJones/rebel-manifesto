Mont-Louis– The Minister for the Regions, Minister responsible for the Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine region and Member of Parliament for the riding of Gaspé, Mr. Gaétan Lelièvre, is pleased to announce financial assistance of $ 13,333 to the Cusimer company for the realization of a project aiming to add mackerel to its product line.
For more than twenty years, Cusimer has offered a wide selection of high quality groundfish, mainly processing turbot as well as other species from accidental catches such as plaice, redfish and haddock. The addition of mackerel is therefore a logical continuation of the diversification and consolidation efforts made by the company over the years, in reaction to the worrying economic situation in the groundfish sector.
“Our government is proud to support this organization which wishes to diversify its activities and, at the same time, develop the commercial fishing and aquaculture sector. This support demonstrates our desire to help businesses promote economic activity in the region, ”said Lelièvre.
The announced financial assistance comes from the Regional Strategic Intervention Fund.
