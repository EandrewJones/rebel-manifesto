“It is with pride that I announce this important contribution from the Government of Quebec, which will stimulate the economic, social and cultural development of the municipality of Labelle while strengthening its power of attraction. Ultimately, the realization of this project will allow local citizens to connect with the world, ”said MP Sylvain Pagé.
The project consists of setting up three antennas, two relay sites and related wireless equipment in order to connect 200 main residences and nearly 600 second homes on Lake Labelle to IHV. Funding for this project, estimated at nearly $ 100,000, will be supplemented by Filau, which will remain the owner of the telecommunications infrastructure deployed.

Stemming from the 2007-2014 National Policy on Rurality, the Branched Rural Communities program aims to support local projects intended to provide rural communities with HSI service of similar quality and at a cost comparable to that offered in urban areas.
