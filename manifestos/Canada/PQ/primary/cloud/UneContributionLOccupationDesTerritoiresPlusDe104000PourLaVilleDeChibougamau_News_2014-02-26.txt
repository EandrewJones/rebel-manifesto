Chibougamau– The Member of Parliament for Ungava, Mr. Luc Ferland, on behalf of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announces financial assistance of $ 104,231 to the City of Chibougamau for the creation of an intercultural urban park at the entrance to Obaski regional park, in Chibougamau. This sum comes from the conjunctural development fund (FCD).
This new park will be installed on the shores of Lake Gilman near downtown Chibougamau. It will become an attractive and stimulating meeting place for the population of the region as well as for tourists. Indeed, the development of the site will include earthworks, the development of a green space serving as a gathering area as well as the construction of a pergola for the holding of shows and Aboriginal celebrations. In addition, the construction of a fireplace, the creation and installation of interpretation panels, the addition of lighting and the construction of a boardwalk leading to the wharf are included in the project. To do this, we plan to remove the current structure of the wharf and rebuild it, build two aquatic platforms and carry out landscaping work. The total cost of the project is estimated at over $ 250,000.
“Our government&#39;s support for this project once again demonstrates our commitment to ensuring the dynamism and vitality of municipalities while taking their reality into account. Ultimately, the population will benefit from a unifying place that will promote meeting and understanding between the Cree and Jamesian communities of Chibougamau and the surrounding area, ”said MP Ferland.
It should be noted that the FCD aims to support initiatives which contribute in particular to economic, social, cultural, tourist, environmental and technological development and which could not be achieved without its contribution.
