Saint-Léon-le-Grand– The MNA for Saint-Maurice, Mr. Luc Trudel, on behalf of the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announces financial assistance from $ 141,850 to the Municipality of Saint-Léon-le-Grand to relocate, in one place, all municipal services, community organizations and administrative offices. This sum comes from the conjunctural development fund (FCD).
Since 1992, the administrative offices of the Municipality of Saint-Léon-le-Grand have been located in the premises of the Saint-Léon elementary school, which is owned by the Chemin-du-Roy school board. In recent years, the municipality has experienced an increase in its population. A larger number of municipal employees is therefore required to meet the growing needs of citizens. Consequently, the space rented to the School Board no longer meets the needs of the municipality and citizens. In addition, the premises of the municipality are located on the second floor and are inaccessible to people with reduced mobility. Some citizens are therefore unable to participate in public council meetings and must seek the help of a relative in order to access certain services.
“Our government&#39;s support for this unifying project once again demonstrates our commitment to ensuring the dynamism and vitality of municipalities while taking their realities into account. Ultimately, the citizens of Saint-Léon-le-Grand will be able to benefit from a nerve center, which will truly meet their needs and which will encourage them to actively participate in the development of their community, ”said MP Trudel.
It should be noted that the FCD aims to support initiatives which contribute in particular to economic, social, cultural, tourist, environmental and technological development and which could not be achieved without its contribution.
