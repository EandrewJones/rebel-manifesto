“I am very happy with the support that the Government of Quebec is giving to the realization of this project. Thanks to this financial assistance, the Aster observatory will be able to contribute to the improvement of the regional tourist offer of the Bas-Saint-Laurent. The consolidation of the observatory&#39;s activities is one of the priorities retained by the MRC of Témiscouata in its new 2013-2016 Economic Development Plan, ”declared Minister Pascal Bérubé.
Remember that Aster is a scientific popularization and recreation station and an interpretation center that caters to both school and local and international tourist customers. Aster pursues a double mandate of interpretation and scientific animation.
Financial assistance comes from the conjunctural development fund of the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy. It is in addition to government assistance of $ 85,000 that was confirmed to the Corporation de Observatoire du Témiscouata-Aster on April 8, 2013 for the restoration of its building. This assistance came from the Collective Entrepreneurship Infrastructure Program (PIEC).
