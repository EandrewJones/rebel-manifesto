Granby– The Minister for the Regions, Minister responsible for the Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine region and Member of Parliament for the riding of Gaspé, Mr. Gaétan Lelièvre, announces the granting of financial assistance of $ 609,862 to the CoopTel cooperative to support the deployment of a high-speed Internet network (HSI) on the territory of the MRC de La Haute-Yamaska, more particularly on the territory of the municipality of Saint-Joachim-de-Shefford, within the framework of of the Connected Rural Communities program.
“It is with pride that I announce this important contribution from the Government of Quebec, which will stimulate the economic, social and cultural development of the MRC while strengthening its power of attraction. Ultimately, the realization of this project will allow local citizens to connect with the world, ”said Minister Lelièvre.
The project consists of installing fiber technology at home in certain uncovered areas of the territory in order to connect 407 households and businesses in the MRC which still do not have access to an HSI connection. Funding for this project, estimated at more than $ 1.2 million, will be supplemented by CoopTel, which will remain the owner of the telecommunications infrastructure deployed.
“Our government reiterates its desire to offer all citizens of Quebec a high-speed Internet connection so that they can count on this indispensable tool in today&#39;s world where knowledge and information and communications technologies play an increasingly strategic role in the socio-economic development of rural areas, ”added the Minister.
Stemming from the 2007-2014 National Policy on Rurality, the Branched Rural Communities program aims to support local projects intended to provide rural communities with HSI service of similar quality and at a cost comparable to that offered in urban areas.
