Quebec - As agreed with the family, the funeral of Mr. Richard Garneau will be the subject of a national commemoration ceremony. The flag of the central tower of the Parliament Building in Quebec will be half-masted the same day. The Quebec government&#39;s Protocol will provide support for the organization of the ceremony.
The funeral will be celebrated on Saturday February 16 at 2 p.m. at the Maison symphonique de Montr√©al.
To contact the organizers of the ceremony, you can write to the following address: ceremonierichardgarneau@gmail.com.
In order to respect the privacy of Mr. Garneau&#39;s family, no media representative will have access to the ceremony venue and no media interviews from the family will be granted. To this end, and out of deference to the family, we count on the full cooperation of the media companies.
