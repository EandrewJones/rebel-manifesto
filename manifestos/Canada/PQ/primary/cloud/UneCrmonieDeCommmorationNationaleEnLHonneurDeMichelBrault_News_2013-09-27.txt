Quebec - The Quebec government has agreed with the family that Michel Brault&#39;s funeral will take the form of a national commemoration ceremony in his memory.
Born in 1928 in Montreal, Michel Brault is one of the greatest filmmakers that Quebec has known. More than thirty films and documentaries bear his mark as a director, cinematographer, producer or editor. His works have traveled the whole world and have paved the way for the international recognition that Quebec cinema enjoys today. A pioneer of direct cinema, Michel Brault&#39;s gaze has made the 7th art evolve to bring it closer to reality and give it a new sensitivity.
The ceremony will be held on Friday, October 4 at 4 p.m., at Saint-Mathieu de Beloeil church.
The flag in the central tower of the Parliament Building will be half-masted the same day. The Quebec government&#39;s Protocol will provide support to the family for the organization of the ceremony.
In order to respect the privacy of those close to Mr. Brault, no media representative will have access to the ceremony venue and no media interview on their part will be granted. To this end, and out of deference to the family, we count on the full cooperation of the media companies.
