Quebec - As agreed with the family, the funeral of Mr. Richard Garneau will be the subject of a national commemoration ceremony.
Born in Quebec in 1930, Mr. Richard Garneau was one of the most brilliant sports commentators of his time. It has served as a model for generations who have been inspired by it. His long career was marked by his eloquence, his professionalism and the passion with which he described the sporting exploits of our athletes. In addition, Mr. Garneau will have been a great ambassador for Quebec; it is indeed with great class and dignity that he represented us at national and international sporting events.
On the day of the national commemoration ceremony, the flag in the central tower of the Parliament Building in Quebec will be half mast. In addition, the Government Protocol will advise the family in organizing the funeral ceremony.
Details regarding Mr. Garneau&#39;s funeral will be known at a later date.
