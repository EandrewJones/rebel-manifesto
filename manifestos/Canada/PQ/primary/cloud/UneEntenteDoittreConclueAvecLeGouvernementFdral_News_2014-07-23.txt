Québec, July 23, 2014 - Jean-François Lisée, the member for Rosemont and official opposition spokesperson for social services, calls on the Minister for Rehabilitation, Youth Protection and Public Health , Lucie Charlebois, so that an agreement can be reached quickly with the federal government for the renewal of the Homelessness Partnering Strategy (HPS).
“Money is sleeping in Ottawa while the needs are crying in Montreal, as everywhere in Quebec. Where is the supposed collaboration between the Liberals and the federal government? I join my voice to that of organizations fighting against homelessness so that the HPS is renewed, following the Quebec approach in this area, which includes priority housing in a wider and more flexible range of interventions ”, declared Jean-François Lisée.
Many projects in development are still waiting for money from the federal government, which says it wants to redirect the remaining 3.2 million to a single program. This approach is contrary to the orientations and ways of doing things in Quebec.
Moreover, on April 30, 2013, the National Assembly unanimously adopted a motion asking that the HPS be renewed under the same conditions. She also denounced the federal intention to &quot;unilaterally modify the Homelessness Partnering Strategy in order to support the only&quot; housing first &quot;approach, which would have the serious consequence of depriving of funding for many important projects. fight against homelessness that meet various needs and realities ”.
“I ask the Liberal Party to be consistent and to respect the will of all elected members of the National Assembly. The homeless community is already having to deal with the postponement by the Liberals of the Homelessness Policy and the action plan that was to follow. I invite Minister Charlebois to act quickly on this file, ”concluded the member for Rosemont.
