Quebec - It is with great joy that the member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, and the member for Joliette and spokesperson for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, learned of the victory, at the Cannes Film Festival, by young Quebec filmmaker Xavier Dolan. He won the Jury Prize for his fifth feature film, Mommy, tied with French director Jean-Luc Godard for Adieu au langue.
“The fact of obtaining this high distinction during the most illustrious film festival in the world is an extraordinary recognition, for which Xavier Dolan can be very proud. We are just as much and, on behalf of the entire Parti Québécois team, we offer him our warmest congratulations! », Said Stéphane Bédard.
Earlier this week, Xavier Dolan said if he won an award at the Cannes Film Festival, it would send a tremendous message of hope to people of his generation. “Indeed, the success of one of their own will serve as an inspiration to many young artists, in Quebec as elsewhere in the world. Of course, you have to be passionate, invest a lot of time and effort, as Xavier Dolan did, but it is quite possible to pursue your ambitions, to give life to a project that you cherish and achieve his goals, whatever they may be. Xavier Dolan, bearer of dreams, hope and pride for his generation, but also for an entire nation, is thus proving to be a powerful antidote to cynicism, ”added Véronique Hivon.
At 25, Xavier Dolan has already established himself among the greats of the seventh art. “His films are at the same time intense, daring and of great cinematographic mastery. Let us hope that Quebecers, like all citizens of the world, will have the chance for a long time to be supported by such an exceptional talent, ”concluded the spokesperson for culture and communications.
