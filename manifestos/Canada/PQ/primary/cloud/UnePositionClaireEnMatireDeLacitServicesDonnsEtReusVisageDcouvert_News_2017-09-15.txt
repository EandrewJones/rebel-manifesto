Quebec, September 15, 2017 - The Parti Québécois candidate in Louis-Hébert, Normand Beauregard, as well as the member for Taschereau and official opposition critic for secularism, Agnès Maltais, were surprised at the position that &#39;posted the liberal candidate in Louis-Hébert, Ihssane El Ghernati, when she congratulated a lady who presented herself at her swearing-in ceremony in 2015 wearing a veil covering her entire face. Worse still: today, the candidate refused to retract; she persists and signs.
“Secularism and equality between women and men are values defended by the Parti Québécois. For us, interactions with the State must be done with their face uncovered. What signal is the Liberal candidate sending in congratulating this controversial behavior? On the contrary, we must clearly declare ourselves in favor of open communication with the face uncovered for all citizens, and this is what I propose to the electors of Louis-Hébert ”, declared Normand Beauregard, candidate. of the Parti Québécois.
“The declarations of the liberal candidate give a very negative glimpse of the government&#39;s vision of secularism. As we study Bill 62 in the National Assembly, it would have been appropriate for the Liberals to send signals in the opposite direction. We must put an end to the ambiguity about religious accommodations concerning the rule of the uncovered face. The principle of secularism must be clearly included in the bill, ”added Agnès Maltais.
The by-election will take place on October 2.
