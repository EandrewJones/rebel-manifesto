Québec, May 16, 2019 - Following the adoption of a motion tabled by the member for Matane-Matapédia and parliamentary leader of the Parti Québécois, Pascal Bérubé, he was delighted that parliamentarians had accepted , unanimously, that the flag of the patriots be raised on a tower of the Parliament Building next Monday, to pay tribute to these pioneers and to underline their courage and their determination.
“The National Assembly thus confirms the importance these men and women have had in the recognition of our nation and the establishment, in Quebec, of a responsible and democratic government. Thanks to this initiative of the Parti Québécois, the struggle of the patriots, symbolized by their flag, will finally be officially recognized, publicly and at its true value, ”said the parliamentary leader.
“The patriots aimed for political freedom and the emancipation of the Quebec people and, despite the threat, they rose up to defend their ideals. We owe them a lot, and it seems important to us to show our pride in their actions as well as our desire to continue this work of national affirmation on a daily basis. This tribute is all the more significant in my eyes as it provides a tremendous follow-up to the action of former Prime Minister Bernard Landry, a great modern-day patriot, whose government established National Patriots&#39; Day, in 2002 ”, continued Pascal Bérubé.
&quot;I invite all Quebecers, as well as municipalities, to proudly mark National Patriots&#39; Day, next Monday, May 20, in tribute to the sacrifices our ancestors had to make for the sustainability of our nation. », Concluded the member for Matane-Matapédia.
