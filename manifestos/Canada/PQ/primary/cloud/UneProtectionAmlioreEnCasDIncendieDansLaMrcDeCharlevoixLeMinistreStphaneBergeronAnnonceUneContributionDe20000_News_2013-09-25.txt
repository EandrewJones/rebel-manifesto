Quebec - The Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, announces a contribution of $ 20,000 to the MRC de Charlevoix. This financial assistance is granted to it for the implementation of its fire safety risk coverage plan.
This sum complements the total contribution of $ 120,000 to which the MRC is entitled under the Financial Assistance Program for MRCs and other regional authorities for the establishment and implementation of risk coverage plans. This financial assistance will allow the MRC to partially cover certain expenses related to carrying out regional activities.
The Premier and Member of Parliament for Charlevoix-Côte-de-Beaupré, Ms. Pauline Marois, welcomed this announcement. “This is an important step in fire safety that has been taken by the MRC de Charlevoix. Thanks to this rigorous planning, the citizens of the region will benefit from better protection, ”declared the Premier.
“The efforts made by all those involved in the implementation of the MRC de Charlevoix fire safety cover plan must be highlighted. This collaboration between the municipalities and the Department of Public Security took several years of work and will ensure a safer living environment for Quebeckers, ”said Minister Bergeron.
The risk coverage plans aim to increase knowledge of the fire risks present in a territory. Thus, they not only make it possible to improve services to citizens while optimizing resources, but also to offer more effective coverage of the territories in the event of fire and to facilitate the work of responders. It is therefore an essential action for the 103 regional authorities and municipalities of Quebec.
