Quebec - The Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, announces the payment of $ 20,000 to the MRC de Rouville. This financial assistance is granted for the implementation of its fire safety risk coverage plan. The Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports and Minister responsible for the Montérégie region, Ms. Marie Malavoy, welcomed this announcement
“The efforts made by all those involved in the implementation of the fire safety cover plan for the MRC de Rouville must be underlined. This collaboration between the municipalities and the Department of Public Security took several years of work and will ensure a safer living environment for Quebeckers, ”said Minister Bergeron.
This sum complements the total contribution of $ 120,000 to which the MRC is entitled under the Financial Assistance Program for MRCs and other regional authorities for the establishment and implementation of risk coverage plans. This financial assistance will allow the MRC to partially cover certain expenses related to carrying out regional activities.
“An important step in fire safety has been taken by the MRC de Rouville. Thanks to this rigorous planning, the citizens of the region will certainly benefit from better fire protection, ”concluded Ms. Malavoy.
The risk coverage plans aim to increase knowledge of the fire risks present in a territory. Thus, they not only make it possible to improve services to citizens while optimizing resources, but also to offer more effective coverage of the territories in the event of fire and to facilitate the work of responders. It is therefore an essential action for the 103 regional authorities and municipalities of Quebec.
