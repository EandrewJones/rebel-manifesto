IN SHORT
The member for Bonaventure is delighted that CAPERN has taken on this mandate of initiative. “We can no longer pretend that the issue of pesticide use in agriculture is not of concern. With this parliamentary committee, we are finally going to have a clear picture of the possible impacts of chemicals on our food, our health and our environment. It&#39;s a great victory for the Parti Québécois! &quot;, He rejoiced.
Sylvain Roy says he is reassured: the fact that the government has agreed to go ahead with the holding of such a parliamentary exercise is rather a good sign. “The survival of healthy agriculture is at stake right now. Like me, organizations, farmers themselves, consumers and research centers are satisfied with this decision, which will allow us to get to the bottom of things. The government seems sensitive to this issue; it&#39;s encouraging, ”he said.
“We want to encourage Quebec families to buy local; they therefore have the right to know exactly what is on their plate. More and more Quebecers are calling for a shift, a transition to agriculture that is more respectful of the environment and, by extension, of public health. It is time for the light to be shed on this whole issue, ”added the spokesperson.
Sylvain Roy is very happy to be at the origin of this initiative mandate. “I believe that at the end of this parliamentary commission, Quebec will be able to position itself as a leader in healthy agriculture. It is, in any case, the objective that we must aim for, ”he concluded.
