Quebec - Parti Québécois finance and revenue spokesperson Nicolas Marceau deplores that the changing of the guard in Ottawa has not put an end to the federal plan to create a Canadian securities commission.
“In Ottawa, the more things change, the more the same. The Quebec business community, united for several years against this project, must remain mobilized in order to make the Trudeau government listen to reason, ”said Mr. Marceau.
The cooperative system promoted by the federal government and Ontario, far from simplifying the supervision of the financial sector, rather duplicates the real system of cooperation already existing between the provinces, and which works very well. The federal project, in addition to encroaching on Quebec&#39;s jurisdiction, creates a double structure that would be nothing more than a waste of time and money for Quebec businesses.
Remember that the National Assembly of Quebec has voted six unanimous motions on this subject since 2006. &quot;We can conclude that regardless of which party is in power in Ottawa, Quebecers are not listened to,&quot; concluded Nicolas Marceau.
