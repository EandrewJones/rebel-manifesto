Quebec - The Minister of Families, Ms. Nicole Léger, today launched a new call for proposals as part of the Support Program for Actions in Father Engagement, on the occasion of the SU-PÈRE FÊTE 2013 organized by theRegroupement pour la valorisation de la paternité.
“In Quebec, fathers are more involved than ever in the care and education of their children. With this new call for proposals for 2013-2014, our government wishes to better support them so that they can occupy a rewarding and stimulating place within their families. The role of the father is essential, and we are taking this opportunity to emphasize it further, ”said Minister Nicole Léger.
The program materializes one of the actions put forward by the Ministry of the Family within the framework of the government action plan for equality between women and men 2011-2015. With a budget of $ 1.45 million over three years, it is aimed at family community organizations (OCFs) and national groups recognized by the Department.
The program makes it possible to support the implementation of diversified local or regional initiatives promoting greater involvement of fathers in their families and the adaptation of the practices of OCFs to the realities of fathers today. These could include, for example, workshops between fathers on their role, workshops on co-parenting or training for OCF staff and volunteers.
As part of this program, the Department offers non-recurring financial support for annual or multi-year initiatives. Support is set at $ 5,000 per organization per year. It can reach $ 50,000 per year for an initiative involving a minimum of four OCFs and $ 70,000 for the initiative of an eligible national grouping.
For the year 2013-2014, the call for proposals runs from June 15 to September 20, 2013. To submit a proposal, please consult the website of the Ministère de la Famille at www..mfa.gouv.qc.ca/engagementdesperes.
