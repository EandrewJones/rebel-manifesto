Quebec - Following the events of last night, the member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, denounces the violence and acts of vandalism perpetrated at the University of Quebec in Montreal (UQAM).
“Violence is always unacceptable. The reprehensible acts of the commandos of masked and hooded demonstrators, directed against people and goods, must be denounced, because they discredit the movements of citizen mobilization. For us, it is zero tolerance. This morning, we appeal for calm; all stakeholders must dissociate themselves from these acts of violence. The Liberal government is responsible for easing tensions, ”said Stéphane Bédard.
“Obviously, the government&#39;s carelessness benefits no one: not students, teachers, administrations, or police forces. We demand that student democracy be recognized, including the right to strike, which implies supervision, ”he added.
“The right to demonstrate is important in a democracy, as is the right to freely express one&#39;s opinions. Students can legitimately oppose liberal austerity. However, this must be done in accordance with the law and without violence. All parties have a responsibility and must report all acts of violence and vandalism. The minister must calm things down, and it is not by inviting the rectors to expel two or three students a day or by throwing oil on the fire that he is properly carrying out his task. », Concluded the leader of the official opposition.
