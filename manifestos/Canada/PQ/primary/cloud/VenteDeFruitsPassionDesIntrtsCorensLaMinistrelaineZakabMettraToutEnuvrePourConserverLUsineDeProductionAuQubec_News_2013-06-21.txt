Montreal - Following the announcement of the sale of the Fruits &amp; Passion company to Korean interests, raising fears of a possible closure of the Candiac plant and the possible loss of 200 jobs, the Minister for Industrial Policy and at the Banque de développement économique du Québec, Ms. Élaine Zakaïb, is committed to doing everything possible to maintain the activities of the production plant in Quebec and thus safeguard as many jobs as possible in the region.
&quot;I can assure you that we will quickly bring together the socio-economic players concerned to promote Quebec&#39;s competitive advantages to the new South Korean buyer, THEFACESHOP&quot;, to convince him to maintain production here, as had been done. the previous purchaser, SC Johnson, declared Élaine Zakaïb. “We must join forces and explore all possible avenues to get there. &quot;
Élaine Zakaïb took the opportunity to recall the major role of the manufacturing sector in the Quebec economy. “This sector, despite its difficulties, remains one of our main sources of growth and productivity. It is therefore imperative for us to support our businesses. Quebec has all the assets required to meet the requirements of foreign buyers. I am confident that together, we will find the necessary arguments to convince the purchaser to review its strategy and to minimize the consequences of this transaction, ”concluded the Minister Delegate.
The company founded by Quebecers was sold to the Canadian subsidiary of the American SC Johnson in 2008. It is the latter which in turn has sold to the Korean company.
