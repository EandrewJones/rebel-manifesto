Quebec - In light of the new revelations concerning the sale of the flagship of the Quebec economy Rona to the American giant Lowe&#39;s, Alain Therrien, spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of economy and member for Sanguinet, again demands the resignation of the minister Jacques Daoust. He also reiterates his request that his former chief of staff, Pierre Ouellet, be heard during the parliamentary committee which will examine the sale of Rona. &quot;Given what we now know, the Prime Minister can no longer oppose his appearance,&quot; he said.
“Jacques Daoust can repeat to anyone who wants to hear him that he never authorized this transaction, but we are not fooled. The Auditor General&#39;s report, the minutes, her presence at an Investissement Québec board of directors and now the emails from her chief of staff, all of this put together not only proves that it was put in the spotlight. current, but that he also approved the transaction, ”said the spokesperson.
“How can the Prime Minister continue to play ostrich and refuse to fire his minister? How can he accept being lied to like this? All the discredit of Jacques Daoust reflects on him and on the liberal government. With all the evidence presented to him, will the Prime Minister finally agree to admit that his minister is placing him in an untenable situation and that he must show him the way out? “, Continued Alain Therrien.
“Jacques Daoust outrageously and deliberately lied to parliamentarians; in doing so he has, in our view, been in contempt of Parliament. This morning, the Parti Québécois therefore sent the President of the National Assembly, Jacques Chagnon, a letter in which it asked him to examine the question. We strongly believe that Jacques Daoust&#39;s lie must not go unpunished. He has lost the confidence of Quebecers, so he can no longer perform his duties, ”concluded the member for Sanguinet.
