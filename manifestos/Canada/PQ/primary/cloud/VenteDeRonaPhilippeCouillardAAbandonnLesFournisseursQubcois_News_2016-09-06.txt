Quebec - The leader of the official opposition and member of Parliament for Jonquière, Sylvain Gaudreault, as well as the member for Sanguinet and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of economy, energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, ask the Minister of Economy, Science and Innovation, Dominique Anglade, to indicate how she intends to ensure the maintenance of Quebec products on the shelves of Rona stores.
“Before Rona was bought by Lowe&#39;s, 47% of the products sold there came from Quebec suppliers. When Philippe Couillard endorsed the sale, he chose to abandon these local businesses. By refusing to act for the protection of our head offices and by pleading for the free market, the Prime Minister defends the free choice of Lowe&#39;s from now on to use its network of American suppliers to supply its stores in Quebec ”, summarized Sylvain Gaudreault. .
“In February, Minister Anglade promised to sit down with the new management of the company to ensure that jobs are kept and that suppliers are protected. It even dangled the latter with the possibility of increasing their exports. Seven months later, while the concern increases, it promises us instead &quot;to support the suppliers&quot;. Is she preparing to accompany them ... to the unemployment office? The prospect is rather frightening ”, for his part lamented Alain Therrien.
“The Rona company was by far the largest distributor and retailer of hardware products in Quebec, and even in Canada. In Quebec alone, it generated economic spinoffs of over $ 2 billion per year and employed some 15,000 people in 343 stores. Rona allowed hundreds of Quebec suppliers to export to the rest of Canada. The Liberal government has chosen to let Rona go. Faced with this accomplished fact, Minister Anglade must tell us how she will ensure that this decision does not have too dramatic consequences for Quebecers, ”concluded the leader of the official opposition.
