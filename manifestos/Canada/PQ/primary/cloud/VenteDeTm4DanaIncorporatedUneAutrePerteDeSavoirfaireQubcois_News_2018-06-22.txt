The official opposition spokesperson for the economy, Alain Therrien, and the spokesperson for energy, Sylvain Rochon, strongly denounce the announced joint venture partnership that will make TM4 a subsidiary of Hydro- Quebec, the supplier to Dana Incorporated, an American company, for electric motors as well as inverters and associated control systems. “In truth, TM4 has been sold, no more and no less,” they say.
IN SHORT
“By presenting the transaction as a &#39;joint venture partnership&#39;, the Liberal government and Hydro-Quebec are trying to make people believe that it is not a sale. However, the reality is that we have just lost control of our know-how, developed over the years thanks to Quebec taxpayers&#39; money. Today, we woke up to learn that a technology of the future developed here, by people from here, has just been sold to foreign interests. This is anything but good news, ”said Alain Therrien.
Sylvain Rochon wonders for his part about, in particular, the intellectual property of TM4. “There is no commitment to its protection; we can therefore fear that it will be transferred to another subsidiary of Dana by a simple decision of the new owner. And what about production activities? There is no guarantee that they will be developed in Quebec. It is more than worrying! He insisted.
“We are wary because the last time the government presented the creation of a joint venture as good news was on the C Series file. Since then, as we have seen, our 49.5% stake has been diluted to 18.5%, and several activities have been relocated to the United States. In short, hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for the C Series program will be used to create a factory as well as new jobs in Alabama, ”concluded Alain Therrien.
