Quebec - In order to support disaster victims in municipalities affected by the strong winds and heavy rains on July 19, 2013, the Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, announces that these municipalities and their citizens, as well as businesses and organizations established in their territory can now benefit from the General Financial Assistance Program in the event of real or imminent disasters.
&quot;The role of the department is to do everything possible to support municipal authorities and come to the aid of all Quebecers to ensure their safety and that of their property,&quot; said Mr. Bergeron.
This government program constitutes aid of last resort and covers, in particular, expenses additional to the current expenses incurred by municipalities for the deployment of temporary preventive, intervention and recovery measures, as well as certain damage suffered by main residences and municipal infrastructure that cannot be covered by insurance.
“The general financial assistance program balances the unfortunate events experienced by the victims. My priority as Minister of Public Security is to make all the necessary efforts so that these people find peace of mind and return to their normal life, ”stated Mr. Bergeron.
