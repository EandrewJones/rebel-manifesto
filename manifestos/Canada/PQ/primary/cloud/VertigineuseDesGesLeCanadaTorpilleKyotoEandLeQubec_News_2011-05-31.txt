Quebec - “The 5% increase in greenhouse gases in two years is very worrying and worrying. The consequences will be significant. However, as long as Quebec is a member of a country that is the main gravedigger of the Kyoto Protocol, it will not be able to distinguish itself, even if it has the best plan in the world. Ottawa undermines the efforts of Quebec with the complicit silence of the Liberal government of Mr. Charest ”.
This is what the member for Vachon and official opposition spokesperson for sustainable development, environment, parks and water, Martine Ouellet said, taking note of the latest data made public on the emission of greenhouse gases.
For the Parti Québécois, the need for Quebec to have its voice in international forums is undeniable. “It is urgent that Quebec becomes a country. Currently, Quebec&#39;s position is diluted in the Canadian position, a position that encourages the tar sands and undermines Quebec efforts, ”Ms. Ouellet added.
For her, Quebec is well positioned to demonstrate the viability of an economy based on green energies. “We have the talent and the knowledge in Quebec to make such a shift. What we lack is the political will. By abandoning the Energy Efficiency Agency, with a slender transport electrification plan, and by blindly promoting shale gas without knowing its impacts, the Charest government cannot achieve this Quebec ambition ”, concluded the member for Vachon.
