Quebec - The Minister of Transport and Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announces the payment of an exceptional sum of $ 6 million which will increase the financial assistance dedicated to vehicles off-road (ORV), more specifically for the realization of durable ATV and snowmobile trails.
“This is a giant leap for the entire industry. The granting of these amounts demonstrates the importance the government attaches to the ORV industry for Quebec&#39;s economic prosperity. These sums will ensure greater safety for users of the trails already in place and those to come. Our priority remains the establishment of sustainable trails. We are continuing to work in close collaboration with our partners to ensure that this project is carried out, ”stated Minister Sylvain Gaudreault.
The federations will share a total of $ 2.4 million over three years for the remuneration of liaison officers who will be key resources for the implementation of sustainable trails. In addition, a sum of $ 3.6 million paid for the same period will finance infrastructure related to the creation of sustainable trails.
A working committee that will be responsible for examining funding formulas to improve existing assistance programs will be created, so as to facilitate the establishment of the infrastructure necessary for the development of sustainable trails.
Minister Gaudreault will soon call on his federal counterpart, Denis Lebel, to get Ottawa involved financially in sustainable trails. “The federal government must significantly support this important industry for all regions of Quebec. I intend to assume strong leadership in this file, ”concluded Minister Gaudreault.
