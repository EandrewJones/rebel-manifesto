Québec - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, as well as the MNA for Taillon and spokesperson for health and access to care, Diane Lamarre , are delighted that the Liberal government has finally agreed to support the Parti Québécois motion asking that all measures limiting women&#39;s rights and access to abortion be removed from Bill 20.
“After refusing to support our motion last week, the government finally came to its senses and retracted its desire to impose abortion quotas. It is a victory for women&#39;s rights. Dozens of women and men working in the health network were worried, with good reason, about the quotas concerning the number of abortions contained in the draft regulation of the Minister of Health. We were not discouraged at the first stubbornness of the Liberal Party, and we will continue to ensure active monitoring so that no other measure comes to infringe the rights of Quebeckers, ”said Carole Poirier.
&quot;Today, by pledging that no measure in Bill 20 will limit women&#39;s rights or the number of abortions that a doctor can perform, the Minister of Health admits that his draft regulation needs to be clarified. As the official opposition, we will ensure that there are no more quotas in the minister&#39;s final regulations. It is his responsibility to protect the rights of women, and we are delighted that he is making this commitment today, ”concluded Diane Lamarre.
The unanimously adopted motion reads as follows:
“That the National Assembly reiterate the right of every woman to have access to her body and to free and accessible abortion services;
That the government ensure that no measure related to Bill 20, An Act to enact the Act to promote access to family medicine and specialized medicine services and to amend various legislative provisions in matters of assisted procreation, limit in any way whatsoever these rights. &quot;
