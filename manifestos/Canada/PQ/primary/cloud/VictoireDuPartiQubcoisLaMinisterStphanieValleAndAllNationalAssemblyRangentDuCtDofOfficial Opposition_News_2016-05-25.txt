Quebec - The member for Taschereau and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on secularism, Agnès Maltais, is delighted with the withdrawal of part 1 of Bill 59, the one including all the articles related to hate speech. It welcomes, moreover, the unanimity of the vote held this afternoon in the National Assembly.
“After a year of debates and discussions in parliamentary committee, after the rejection by the majority of the population and almost all groups in society of the part relating to hate speech, the minister finally hears reason and withdraws it. As early as August 2015, we called for the splitting of the bill so that hate speech and forced marriages are treated separately. It took 8 months of committee work to get there, but we are there, ”said Agnès Maltais.
“It was obvious to everyone that restricting freedom of expression was nonsense, a dangerous avenue the government was taking us. This could have introduced in Quebec a climate of self-censorship harmful to our social and democratic life. The solution to countering hate speech will always remain freedom of expression itself and the debates to which it gives rise. We welcome Minister Vallée&#39;s step back; it is a great victory for the population and for freedom of expression, ”the spokesperson concluded.
