Quebec - The member for Vachon and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on transport, Martine Ouellet, and the member for Joliette and spokesperson for culture and communications, Véronique Hivon, deplore the attitude of the Couillard government in the dossier of the Village des Tanneries, an archaeological site located near the new Turcot interchange.
“The supposed government of transparency doubled its wrongs with an affront by taking advantage of a weekend to shave part of the Village des Tanneries on the sly. To defend himself, the Minister of Transport downplays the scale of the discovery, while historians and archaeologists say on the contrary that the site is important. It was not even possible to obtain the details of the scenarios envisaged to save the Village, as if the Ministry had never evaluated this possibility ”, declared Martine Ouellet.
“Where is the Minister of Culture and what is she doing to protect the site? Hurry up; if nothing is done by the end of the week, all that will be left of the Tanneries Village will be artefacts and maybe a few stone pallets. The Minister of Transport and the Minister of Culture must find real solutions, in full transparency and in concert with the community. The latter, moreover, has a duty to protect the heritage of Quebecers, and it must not shirk its responsibilities. However, after the sad episode of the Saint-Sulpice library and that of the heritage building located at 3725, rue Saint-Denis, in Montreal, once again, it sends a very bad message as to the importance it attaches to the preservation of our collective memory, ”concluded Véronique Hivon.
