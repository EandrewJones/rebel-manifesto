Quebec - The member for Gaspé and official opposition spokesperson for municipal affairs and regional development, Gaétan Lelièvre, denounces the abolition of the Support Fund for Territories in Difficulty (FSTD). He asks the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Land Occupancy, Pierre Moreau, to reverse his decision, which constitutes a new attack on the development of the regions.
“In all our regions, the liberal rampage continues; once again, no one will be spared. After cutting the resources and development tools of the regions, in particular the local development centers and the regional conferences of elected officials, and having imposed cuts of 300 million on the municipal world, the government continues to suffocate our regions. The very day the Quebec Employers Council (CPQ) apologizes for proposing to relocate families from devitalized regions to large centers, we learn that the minister is cutting a fund of 53 million intended for villages in difficulty. Clearly, the Liberals have no vision of the occupation of our territory. These municipalities need support and a structural plan to maximize their development, ”said Gaétan Lelièvre.
However, during a meeting with the prefects of Gaspésie last Friday, Pierre Moreau rejected the CPQ&#39;s proposal, which suggested using FSTD sums to help people leave the regions. The minister maintained that this idea made no sense and that the government should, on the contrary, help people settle in the regions.
&quot;Who was the minister trying to convince last Friday?&quot; How could he reject the CPQ&#39;s proposal, when he was doing even worse by completely abolishing the FSTD, the main tool to help the most vulnerable municipalities? Obviously, he speaks from both sides of the mouth! It is a sad day for Quebec. The government must back down; this measure is insane, ”concluded Gaétan Lelièvre.
