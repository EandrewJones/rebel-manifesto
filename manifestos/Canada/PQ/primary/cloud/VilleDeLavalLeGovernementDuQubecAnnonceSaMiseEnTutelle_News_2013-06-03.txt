Quebec - The Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, announces the government&#39;s decision to immediately subject Ville de Laval to the control of the Commission municipale du Québec (CMQ ).
“Our government was quick to respond to Laval&#39;s request and put the City under supervision. Through this action, we are taking the necessary means to restore the confidence of the population and to ensure the good administration of the municipality, in the interest of all citizens. From now on, I have full confidence in the CMQ, which will play its role in exercising control over City decisions, ”said Minister Gaudreault.
The subjugation of a municipality to the control of the CMQ is a temporary measure which takes effect upon the promulgation of the decree by the government. As an independent administrative body, the Commission municipale du Québec, during a tutorship, approves or not the decisions taken by the municipality concerned.
