Quebec - The Minister of Municipal Affairs, Regions and Land Occupancy and Minister of Transport, Mr. Sylvain Gaudreault, takes note of the remarks made by the mayor of the City of Laval, Mr. Alexandre Duplessis, and of his request for subject the City to the control of the Commission municipale du Québec (CMQ).
“I take note of the request of the mayor of Ville de Laval. This is a good decision. Over the past year, a series of exceptional events have marked the management of the City&#39;s affairs and seriously weakened the public&#39;s confidence in its administration. I recognize that it is in the interest of Ville de Laval and its population that action be taken quickly to restore the credibility of the municipal administration through the intervention of the CMQ. I therefore undertake to prepare the decree and bring it to the Council of Ministers because, in this case, it is the government that must subject a municipality to the control of the CMQ ”, declared Minister Gaudreault.
The first step is the issuance of a decree by the government. This decree can take effect from its promulgation. Subsequently, the CMQ publishes a notice in the Gazette officielle du Québec mentioning the subjugation of the municipality to its control. At the time of a tutorship, the CMQ exercises its supervisory functions as determined by law, with or without approving the decisions taken by the municipality concerned.
