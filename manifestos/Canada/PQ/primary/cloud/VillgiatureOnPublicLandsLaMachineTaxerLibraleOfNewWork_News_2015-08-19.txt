Quebec - Sylvain Roy, the member for Bonaventure and official opposition spokesperson for forests, wildlife and parks, strongly denounces the excessive rent increases imposed on the owners of cottages built on public land, who, in some cases can reach 530%. He asks the government to come to its senses and back down on its intentions.
“With these increases, we are heading towards the outright privatization of a territory that belongs to Quebeckers. This decision goes completely against the democratic principle of the use of public land by citizens, without discrimination as to their income or social status. Because of these abusive increases, many vacationers, who practice sport hunting in particular, will have to give up their chalet, unable to pay what is demanded of them. Do we want to return to the occupation of public lands by well-heeled private clubs, a practice that was abolished in Quebec in the late 1970s by Yves Duhaime and the Parti Québécois government? Sylvain Roy wondered.
Several decades of occupation of the territory The spokesperson also deplores the fact that this decision is a new direct attack on the regions of Quebec, where the majority of Quebec&#39;s public lands are located. It is also an affront to the citizens who have been building and improving their vacation resort for several decades, taking for granted that the price of rents will remain affordable. “Several tenants of resort leases have laid paths and worked on improving public lands and are told, overnight: rates are going up and, if you can&#39;t afford to pay, you won&#39;t. no longer have your place on Quebec public lands. It is completely scandalous! The Minister of Natural Resources, Pierre Arcand, as responsible for the management of lands in the domain of the State, must tell us that his government has already forgotten this very bad idea, ”concluded the Member for Bonaventure.
