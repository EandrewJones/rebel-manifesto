Quebec - “The Harper government is once again showing that it does not understand the reality of Quebec. By wanting to make regulatory changes to wine labeling, the government will penalize Quebec icewine producers who have their own manufacturing method adapted to winter conditions here, ”declared the Member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata. and official opposition critic for agriculture and food, André Simard.
Indeed, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, in a press release published last week, announces that the name “ice wine” could now only belong to wines produced with grapes that have frozen on the vine. “In Quebec, there is a lot of snow and our winegrowers have developed a specific Quebec method to adapt to it: they suspend the grapes in nets placed above the vines until the frost period. This method is also recognized by the International Organization of Vine and Wine. Why does the Conservative government refuse to rely on this recognition and unfairly penalize Quebec producers? », Said André Simard.
Rather, the Parti Québécois is proposing to facilitate the procedures allowing the emergence of Quebec controlled appellation products. “Ottawa does not have to choose for us,” concluded MP André Simard.
