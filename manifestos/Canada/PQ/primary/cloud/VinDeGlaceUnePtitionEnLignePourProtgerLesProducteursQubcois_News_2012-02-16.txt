Quebec - “The consultation launched by the Harper government with the aim of making regulatory changes to wine labeling that could have terrible consequences for Quebec icewine producers is generating a lot of reactions. Indeed, the producers in the field are mobilizing and it is a pleasure for me to bring an electronic petition asking the elected representatives of the National Assembly to unite to defend the producers ”, declared the member for Kamouraska-Témiscouata and Official Opposition Agriculture and Food Critic, André Simard.
The petition explains the specificities of Quebec production recognized by the International Organization of Vine and Wine and underlines the prosperity of Quebec ice wines around the world.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency, in a press release published in January, announced that the name “ice wine” could now only belong to wines produced with grapes that have frozen on the vine.
“This consultation is yet another illustration of the Conservative government&#39;s lack of understanding of Quebec&#39;s particularities. There is no way we can let him do it without saying anything, ”added André Simard.
“As we have been repeating for several months, we at the Parti Québécois want to support the emergence of the greatest number of local products and specific Quebecois”, concluded André Simard, inviting the population to visit the website of the National Assembly to sign the petition overwhelmingly.
