Quebec - Faced with the unilateral lowering of the ceiling for the assistance program for Quebec winegrowers, the agriculture spokesperson for the Parti Québécois, André Villeneuve, demands from the government that it respect its part of the contract and that it pay the total amount provided.
In fact, when it was previously set at $ 300,000, the Liberals have reduced the aid program limit to $ 100,000 without warning. “The Parti Québécois, by improving the program, had enabled producers to make significant investments in their businesses. The fact that the Liberals are reneging on a government commitment is therefore putting all these entrepreneurs in an untenable financial situation. More than a broken promise, it&#39;s downright a breach of contract! The winegrowers planned their development according to the amounts provided for in the agreement with the government. They borrowed large sums to invest, and there, the Liberals refuse to honor their part of the contract! It is totally irresponsible to act in this way and thus undermine an entire industry, ”denounced André Villeneuve.
Remember that before the holidays, the spokesperson had to intervene in the National Assembly, as in the previous year, for the Minister of Finance, Carlos Leitão, to commit to paying the planned assistance to Quebec winegrowers. However, despite his promise, only part of the money was paid. However, the results of this aid program, set up by the Parti Québécois, had exceeded all expectations: sales of Quebec products had increased by 60%.
&quot; This is unacceptable. For two years, the Liberal government, by reneging on its commitments, has abandoned the winegrowers and sabotaged their efforts. He should be supporting them, but he is destroying a booming industry. The Liberals must immediately lower the ceiling to $ 300,000 and pay our entrepreneurs the total sums that were originally planned, ”concluded the member for Berthier.
