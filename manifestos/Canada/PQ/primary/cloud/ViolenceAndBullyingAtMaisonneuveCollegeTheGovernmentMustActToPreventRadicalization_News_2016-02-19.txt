Quebec - Member of Parliament Agnès Maltais, deputy parliamentary leader of the official opposition and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on secularism, reacts strongly to allegations that there is violence and intimidation at the Collège de Maisonneuve. According to the newspaper La Presse, which reports this story this morning, one of the individuals involved is linked to a terrorist group.
“During the election campaign, the Prime Minister pledged to fight against radicalization and religious fundamentalism. However, all we have on the table for the moment is a bill that attacks the freedom of expression of all Quebecers, ”said Agnès Maltais.
Let us recall that the Parti Québécois has already proposed the establishment of an observatory of religious fundamentalism. Bill 395 was inspired by the work of former Liberal MP Fatima Houda-Pepin, the very one who was expelled from the Liberal Party caucus by Philippe Couillard because she took the threat of religious fundamentalism seriously and that she demanded firm action from her leader. Two years later, we are still waiting and dissatisfaction is mounting because the reluctant Liberal government continues to twiddle its thumbs on this issue.
“I repeat: Bill 59 is a liberticidal bill, and it is not at all adequate to fight against radicalization or prevent situations like the one that seems to be taking place at the Collège de Maisonneuve. What we need are additional resources. In this way, educational institutions and police forces would be able to correctly apply the provisions of the Criminal Code, which already allow the prosecution of dangerous preachers. Creating an observatory of fundamentalism would be a good step in this direction, ”concluded the member for Taschereau.
