Quebec City, March 24, 2017 - The Parti Québécois spokesperson for the status of women, Mireille Jean, and the spokesperson for public security, Pascal Bérubé, call on the ministers of Public Security and responsible for the Status of Women , Martin Coiteux and Lise Thériault, so that the 2012-2017 government action plan on domestic violence is finally implemented.
“When the action plan was implemented, an awareness campaign was planned. Why has the Liberal government never launched it? In fact, the Liberals have done nothing, in concrete terms, to advance the fight against domestic violence. The Parti Québécois made it a priority when it drew up the action plan, ”Mireille Jean recalled.
“Martin Coiteux must take the situation in hand and stop procrastinating. He must also tell us why the domestic violence death review committee does not yet exist. This aspect is however one of the most important of the action plan; the creation of this committee is demanded by the Regroupement des maisons pour femmes victims of conjugal violence for a long time, ”added Pascal Bérubé.
“Before being responsible for the Status of Women, Lise Thériault was Minister of Public Security; she should therefore be twice as aware of the issue of domestic violence! So why have we been waiting for the annual reviews of the action plan for three years? It is scandalous that within a year of its deadline, the Minister has not played a more active role in implementing it. Was the plan simply put aside? », Asked Mireille Jean.
