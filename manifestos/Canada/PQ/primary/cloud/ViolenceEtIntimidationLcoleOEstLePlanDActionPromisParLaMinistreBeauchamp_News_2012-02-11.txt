Quebec - Sylvain Gaudreault, MP for Jonquière and official opposition spokesperson for elementary and secondary education, urges Education Minister Line Beauchamp to present a new action plan to counter violence and bullying at school.
“Since last April, Minister Beauchamp has promised us a new action plan to prevent and deal with violence in schools. Ten months later and still nothing. It&#39;s urgent, ”said Sylvain Gaudreault, who recalled that last fall, the Parti Québécois made concrete proposals to counter bullying in schools.
The Parti Québécois is concerned about the Liberal government&#39;s reluctance to rewrite its action plan, unveiled in 2008, which turned out to be totally ineffective. “Students&#39; fear of being subjected to violence or bullying at school greatly affects their academic success,” added Sylvain Gaudreault.
Next Tuesday, the MP for Champlain, Noëlla Champagne, will also table a petition initiated by a young 13-year-old student in Mauricie. “Émanuelle Després&#39; approach is extraordinary and reflects the state of mind of parents, teachers and students: they all want their message to be heard at last and for the Liberal government to understand the urgency of taking action to the well-being of our students, ”continued the MP.
“Violence and bullying in schools are real scourges that spread at great speed. It is time for justice to be done and for Minister Beauchamp to take action to make our young people feel safe at school, ”concluded the Member for Jonquière.
