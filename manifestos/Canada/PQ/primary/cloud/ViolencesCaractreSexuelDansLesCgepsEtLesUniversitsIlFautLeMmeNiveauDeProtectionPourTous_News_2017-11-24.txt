Québec, November 24, 2017 - The official opposition spokesperson for the status of women, Catherine Fournier, today presented the demands of the Parti Québécois for the clause-by-clause consideration of Bill 151, An Act to to prevent and combat sexual violence in higher education establishments. On this occasion, she was accompanied by Jason St ‑ Amour, President of the Fédération d&#39;études collégiale du Québec (FECQ), and Simon Telles, President of the Union Étudiante du Québec (UEQ).
IN SHORT
“This bill was eagerly awaited. It is an important step in raising awareness, preventing and combating sexual violence. At the end of the special consultations, however, it appears clear that Bill 151 must be firmer and aim for greater standardization of policies, in order to guarantee the same level of protection to all students and to all students, regardless of the institution attended. The seriousness of an act of sexual violence does not vary from region to region, ”said Catherine Fournier.
&quot;We expect the bill to clearly outlaw the intimate bond between a student and a member of the staff of the educational institution if there is also a relationship between the two that could have an impact on the academic progress of the student. However, this would not apply if the intimate bond existed before the strictly educational relationship, ”explained Simon Telles.
“We must also ensure an efficient handling of complaints and reports: support in less than 5 days, and complete process in 45 days maximum. To do this, of course, sufficient human and financial resources must be available. In addition, any limitation period must be prohibited, ”added Jason St ‑ Amour.
“Everyone recognizes that the fight against sexual violence is a fundamental social issue. This is why I am convinced that we will be able to continue working together with the other parties during the detailed study of the bill, in order to provide the necessary details, ”the spokesperson concluded.
