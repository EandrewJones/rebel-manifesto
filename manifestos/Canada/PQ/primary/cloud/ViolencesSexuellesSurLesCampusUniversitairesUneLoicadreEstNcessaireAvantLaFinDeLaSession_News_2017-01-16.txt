Québec, January 16, 2017 – Following the publication of the results of the Sexuality, Security and Interactions in University Environment (ESSIMU) survey, the Parti Québécois spokesperson for education, research and school perseverance and literacy, Alexandre Cloutier, and the spokesperson for the status of women, Mireille Jean, once again call on the government to adopt a framework law to counter sexual violence in universities.
“The portrait of sexual assault in universities presented in the report is extremely disturbing. The phenomenon is very real, it is even becoming a scourge. We have been asking the government for a long time to take action and introduce framework legislation that tackles this aggressively. Unfortunately, for almost two and a half years there was radio silence on the government file. It took the events of last fall at Laval University to finally make up his mind to move forward. For now, Minister David is leaving all the doors open; a framework law, a framework policy, an action plan ... The researchers were clear during their press conference: to finally succeed in countering the phenomenon, it will take strong resources, and that the sums are there . The Minister must commit to tabling a framework law before the end of the parliamentary session, ”insisted Alexandre Cloutier.
“Sexual violence on college campuses is not an isolated situation. It proves to be the manifestation that inequalities persist between women and men in Quebec society. Solutions to this phenomenon must therefore be designed from a global perspective, and not just on campus. In other words, actions must be combined, particularly in the areas of public health, education, public security and justice. But, first of all, we must stop targeting the victims and instead attack the people who commit sexual violence and the culture of rape, ”added Mireille Jean.
