Gaspé - On the occasion of the inauguration of the Carrefour intermodal de Gaspé, the Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, accompanied by the Minister for the Regions and Minister responsible for the Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine region, Gaétan Lelièvre, announced the award of a $ 10 million grant to the Société du chemin de fer de la Gaspésie to carry out work to upgrade the railway structures between Gaspé and Percé.
This financial assistance of $ 10 million is primarily aimed at the rehabilitation of three railway bridges located between Gaspé and Percé. The work planned for these infrastructures is a prerequisite for the entry into service of the L&#39;Amiral tourist train in this sector. This aid will also allow other works to be carried out on the same section.
“I am very happy to announce an investment that will have positive spinoffs for the Gaspé by leading to an enriched tourist service offer for the many international vacationers and cruise passengers who visit the region. Today we are taking a concrete step that reaffirms my government&#39;s desire to participate in the influence of our regions, ”declared the Premier.
“This is very good news for the entire population of the Gaspé. This investment will increase the tourist attractiveness of our beautiful region. This train project has long been hoped for and I am happy to see that it will come to fruition. Our region is a destination of choice for many tourists and, from now on, they will have another good reason to extend their stay, ”concluded Gaétan Lelièvre.
