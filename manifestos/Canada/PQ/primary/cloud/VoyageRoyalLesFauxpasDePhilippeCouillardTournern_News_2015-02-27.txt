Quebec - The MNA for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and official opposition critic for international relations, Carole Poirier, deplores the series of missteps and unfortunate statements by the Liberal government and Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, which tarnish the image of Quebec in France.
“In this period of Liberal-Caquist austerity, the fact that six ministers are accompanying the Prime Minister abroad is an insult to Quebec families, who are being attacked head-on by blind cuts, based solely on accounting logic. Le Figaro said aloud what diplomats will not say publicly: the government of Philippe Couillard has humiliated the government of France by tripling the tuition fees of French students, and the Prime Minister adds more by justifying his royal visit with six ministers by the fact that it is not so expensive since our hosts pay the expenses of accommodation and ground transport ”, declared Carole Poirier.
“The government of the Liberal Party only multiplies the blunders with regard to France; it is shameful. All the previous governments, PQ or Liberals, have always shown great sensitivity for the special relationship that Quebec maintains with France. By repeatedly insulting the French, the provincialist government of Philippe Couillard is destroying this historic relationship. The Prime Minister should apologize for the inappropriate comments he made and which shocked the French, ”concluded the MP.
