Quebec - While concerns about security around Quebec detention centers are felt, the Parti Québécois spokesperson for public security, Pascal Bérubé, asks Minister Lise Thériault to tell us clearly where she is. is regarding the installation of cellular wave jammers.
Remember that the Marois government had called on the federal authorities to obtain authorization to use these devices. “We want to know exactly where the minister is on this file. What actions has she taken? Has she made representations to the federal government? Did she get anything? », Asked Pascal Bérubé.
We learned this week that the number of drone flights over detention centers had increased. “The installation of devices to jam cellular waves could obstruct the illegal activities of some inmates. First, it would render the contraband cellphones, which allow criminals to continue their illegal activities in prison and even plan an escape, unusable. The interference of the waves would also prevent the overflight of the prisons by drones, since the remote-controlled signal could no longer be picked up by the flying machine, ”explained the deputy.
“The disturbing news is mounting, correctional officers are sounding the alarm. When will the minister take all the necessary measures to reassure the public and prevent escapes or other unfortunate events? », Concluded Pascal Bérubé.
