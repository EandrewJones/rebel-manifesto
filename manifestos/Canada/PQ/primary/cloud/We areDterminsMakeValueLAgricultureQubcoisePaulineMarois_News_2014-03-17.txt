Longueuil - After a meeting with members of the Union des producteurs agricoles (UPA), the Premier of Quebec and leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, pledged to continue implementing the Food Sovereignty Policy.
“This policy, which affects the entire agricultural and biofood sector in Quebec, was expected for many years. The Liberal government never wanted to propose such a policy. For our part, we are aiming for the production of quality Quebec foods and want them to take up more space on Quebecers&#39; plates. We also want to develop a prosperous, profitable biofood sector that generates jobs and respects the environment, ”said the Prime Minister.
The Parti Québécois government has already acted by implementing several concrete measures:
“My government has taken concrete, strong and creative actions to support and grow Quebec&#39;s biofood sector. From agricultural producers to government institutions, we want to create quality jobs in every region. We are determined to build a stronger and more independent Quebec in the agricultural and biofood sector, ”concluded Pauline Marois.
We have a plan and the team to be successful. Today, it is time to give ourselves the means to go even further.
Watch the press conference.
