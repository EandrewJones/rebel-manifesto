For them, it is essential that public health and prevention issues be at the heart of the process. “The choices made over the next few months will have significant consequences for the population of Quebec for several decades. The subject in question and its effects on public health, especially with regard to young people, require that we be attentive, far-sighted and rigorous. The public interest will guide our interventions. I know that a good number of Quebeckers are worried. I will be present to listen to them and discuss with them at each of the seven consultations &quot;, declared Sylvain Pagé from the outset.&quot; We offered our collaboration to the government; we will participate in all of these consultations in good faith. That said, we still believe that the exercise should be held everywhere in Quebec, and in a cross-party fashion. All Quebecers have the right to express themselves &quot;, insisted Harold LeBel.&quot; We will be particularly attentive to the issue of distribution. The Parti Québécois believes that all profits from the sale of cannabis should be used for prevention and rehabilitation, ”concluded Sylvain Pagé.
