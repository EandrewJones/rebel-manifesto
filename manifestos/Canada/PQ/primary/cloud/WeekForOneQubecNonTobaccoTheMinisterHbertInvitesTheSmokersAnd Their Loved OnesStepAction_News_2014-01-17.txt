Quebec - “The prevention and adoption of healthy lifestyles is a growing concern, both for our health network, but also for all Quebecers. Smoking cessation is a very symbolic gesture in this regard. As the Quebec week for a tobacco-free Quebec begins, I encourage smokers to take action and quit once and for all. This is what the Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for Seniors, Dr. Réjean Hébert, said on the eve of the Week for a Tobacco Free Quebec, which takes place this year from 19 to 25 January.
Tobacco claims 28 victims per day in Quebec. It is responsible for the deaths of no less than 10,400 Quebeckers each year, thus constituting the most important cause of preventable deaths. Smokers who wish to quit smoking can count on various smoking cessation assistance services offered free of charge, particularly in smoking cessation centers in all regions of Quebec.
“Those who choose to quit smoking are opting for a better quality of life and better health. Indeed, quitting smoking is to extend your life expectancy by almost 10 years. We can all help reduce the smoking rate in Quebec, in particular by encouraging smokers around us to take action. This is a way of participating in the well-being of our society - especially of our youth - and of gradually developing a smoke-free Quebec, ”Minister Hébert also indicated.
It should be remembered that the Ministry of Health and Social Services is carrying out numerous actions to encourage a profound change in social norms in the area of smoking, actions based mainly on the Tobacco Act and the Quebec Plan for the Fight against Smoking. . Efforts are therefore being made for prevention, particularly among young people, as well as for protection against exposure to second-hand smoke.
