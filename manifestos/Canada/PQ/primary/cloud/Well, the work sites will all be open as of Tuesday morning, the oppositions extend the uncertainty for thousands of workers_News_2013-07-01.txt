Quebec - The National Assembly adopts the Act respecting the resumption of work in the construction industry (pdf). “Thanks to the government&#39;s action, all construction sites will be open from Tuesday morning; we should be happy about it, ”said the Prime Minister.
Throughout the conflict, the Government of Quebec acted responsibly and reasonably to ensure that the parties reached a negotiated solution. The employers&#39; associations in the residential, road and civil engineering sectors and the Alliance Syndicale have succeeded, allowing nearly 100,000 workers to return to the sites at the beginning of last week.
As a solution to the deadlock in negotiations in the industrial-commercial and institutional sectors, the Government of Quebec has proposed a bill with the aim of restoring lasting peace and stability on all projects until 2017. Instead, the PLQ-CAQ tandem decided to opt, without compromise, for a short-term solution that prolongs the uncertainty about the working conditions of thousands of workers.
“Philippe Couillard&#39;s attitude in the debate surrounding the adoption of the special law once again demonstrates that nothing has changed at the PLQ. We always try to make the confrontations last and to bet on the division. We had the opportunity to restore calm and serenity in relations between workers and employers. The liberal opposition preferred uncertainty, instability and its partisan interests instead of lasting peace on construction sites, the dynamism of the economy and the best interests of Quebecers ”, continued the Minister of Labor, Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity and Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Agnès Maltais.
“I salute the efforts of the Minister of Labor, Employment and Social Solidarity to resolve this conflict. We have always put the general interest before anything else. We will do everything we can to allow the parties to continue their negotiations this year, ”concluded Pauline Marois.
