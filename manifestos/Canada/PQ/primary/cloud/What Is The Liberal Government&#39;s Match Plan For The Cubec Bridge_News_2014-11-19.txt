Québec - The MNA for Vachon and official opposition critic for transport, Martine Ouellet, and the MNA for Taschereau, parliamentary leader and spokesperson responsible for the Capitale-Nationale region, Agnès Maltais, ask the Liberal government to say what its game plan is for painting the Quebec Bridge.
“Minister Robert Poëti informed us yesterday that he had sent a letter to CN to inform the company that he would like to see a regulation come about for the painting of the Quebec Bridge. Does the minister really think that a letter of wishes from him will convince CN? Rather, he should contact his federal counterpart to resolve the problem that Ottawa itself created when it ceded the rights to the bridge to CN when it was privatized in 1995, ”said Martine Ouellet.
&quot;The Prime Minister said, during the election campaign, that it was a shame to see the bridge&quot; half rusted and half painted &quot;. While the file gets bogged down, besides writing to CN, does the government have a strategy? Will he contact Minister Denis Lebel to see if a legislative change could protect our national heritage? », Concluded Agnès Maltais.
