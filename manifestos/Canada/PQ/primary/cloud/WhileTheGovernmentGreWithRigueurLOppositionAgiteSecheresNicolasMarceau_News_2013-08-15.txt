Montreal - “Our government is dedicated to economic growth and sound management of public finances, unlike Philippe Couillard, who prefers to wave scarecrows. Liberal alarmist remarks and anxieties do not deceive anyone: everyone remembers that the Liberals inflated Quebec&#39;s debt by nearly a third and plunged Quebec into deficit, ”declared the Minister of Finance and the Economy, Mr. Nicolas Marceau.
Quebec&#39;s economic and financial situation compares favorably with that of its neighbors. “While the federal and Ontario governments are facing very large deficits, Quebec will be back to balanced budgets this year. Regarding spending control, our government delivered the goods, with growth of 1.7% in 2012-2013, the best performance of the last fifteen years, even though the Liberal government has spent lavishly. on the eve of the elections, ”added the Minister.
The latest employment data show that Quebec has 70,000 more jobs since the start of the year, compared to the same period in 2012. Employment growth in Quebec (1.8%) is higher compared to Ontario (1.4%), Canada (1.4%) and the United States (1.6%). &quot;This clearly shows that the strategy we have established is working: stimulating private investment to ensure the prosperity of all regions,&quot; said the Minister.
He noted that the GDP growth forecast released by the Ministry of Finance and Economy last March stands at 1.3%. The most recent private sector forecasts confirm these data: Desjardins forecasts growth of 1.3%, while the Conference Board of Canada and RBC have forecast it at 1.4%.
“Liberal angst pushes Mr. Bachand to take distressing shortcuts in his analysis of the economic situation in Quebec. For our part, we are staying the course on returning to a balanced budget for 2013-2014, ”concluded Mr. Marceau.
