Québec, May 23, 2014 - Nicole Léger, the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition spokesperson for elementary and secondary education, asks the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports, Yves Bolduc, to make public the internal report of his department indicating that there were irregularities in the interactive whiteboards file.
“This project, taken out like a rabbit out of his hat by Prime Minister Jean Charest during his opening speech in 2011, has raised questions from the start concerning not only the educational need for tools, but also the ethical aspect of the call for tenders for their deployment, ”said Nicole Léger.
An article in the Devoir tells us that there was a lack of planning, monitoring and training - the findings of the report clearly establishing the management errors made in this program - and even that the MELS would not have received the notice. teachers before and during the use of these tables.
We also learn from the media that the report indicated the presence of only two bidders for the call for tenders. The firm that obtained the contract was represented by Martin Daraîche, a former advisor to Minister Nathalie Normandeau and Prime Minister Charest.
“Quebecers paid for the purchase of these paintings; it is normal that they can have access to the report and know what Minister Yves Bolduc will do with it. This program needs to be carefully studied. Teachers, professionals and students deserve the best tools to promote learning, but they still need to be appropriate and effective, ”concluded the MP.
