Quebec, January 27, 2017 - Agnès Maltais, Parti Québécois spokesperson for ethics and integrity, denounces the opacity of the Liberal government regarding the exclusion of Pierre Paradis from the Council of Ministers and the caucus liberal.
“The Prime Minister confirmed this morning at a press briefing that Pierre Paradis was not relieved of his duties following a horseback accident, but following a complaint of a sexual nature. However, Philippe Couillard let run false information, transmitted by the office of the Minister of Agriculture more than 24 hours earlier. The Prime Minister therefore endorsed the fact that erroneous information, on a major issue, transmitted by a member of his government, is circulating, ”said Agnès Maltais.
“It is once again on a matter of transparency and ethics that the Prime Minister has failed in his task. We still expect him to send Quebeckers all the information on how to manage this crisis. He told us that he was informed on January 19 that his minister was the subject of a report to the Sûreté du Québec. At that time, he did nothing. It was only when he received a formal letter from the complainant that he decided to act. This is unacceptable, ”added the spokesperson.
“All these crises that the Liberal government has been going through on a regular basis for almost three years are harmful for Quebec. In addition to causing a loss of confidence in the population of politicians, they distract from essential issues. The Liberal Party is worn out, undermined by internal crises, and it is the citizens who are paying the price, ”concluded the MP.
