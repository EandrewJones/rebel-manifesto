Québec, July 13, 2016 - Martine Ouellet, MP for Vachon and Parti Québécois spokesperson for transport and maritime strategy, finds it surprising that Prime Minister Philippe Couillard is praising the merits of his maritime strategy in Europe, in s &#39;allocating investments that are not within its purview, since the vast majority of them come from the Canadian government.
“The Prime Minister is strutting around Europe when he is unable to repair the wharf in Rimouski, a flagship city of Quebec expertise. How can it, in its maritime strategy, take credit for these investments in federal infrastructure? For the rest, it is an amalgam of advertisements that he uses to artificially inflate his strategy. In addition, these announcements stem mainly from the tourism strategy put in place by the Parti Québécois government, ”said Martine Ouellet.
“This is the government&#39;s way of doing things, empty words, empty announcements. The Liberals are not even in a position to regulate the protection of the beluga breeding area in Cacouna. They insist on creating a logistics hub in Soulanges which, in addition to being located on the best agricultural land in the region, favors the port of New York to the detriment of the port of Montreal. Not to mention the many sagas of the Ferry Company: cost overruns, poor communication in orders, price increases. For a true maritime strategy, we must repatriate all our assets: ports, wharves, seaway, and to do this, Quebec must be independent, ”she concluded.
