Québec, September 15, 2016 - The member for Taschereau and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois on secularism, Agnès Maltais, and the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and spokesperson for the status of women, Carole Poirier, denounce the double speech by the Prime Minister regarding women&#39;s rights and secularism.
“When the opportunity arises, the premier of Quebec, Philippe Couillard, is quick to wrap himself in the values concerning equality between men and women to criticize his political opponents who debate the religious neutrality of the state . However, he remains quite silent when the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, attends places of worship openly advocating segregation between men and women. In addition, Philippe Couillard remains reluctant to criticize religious leaders who impose a dress code on women in the name of religion. Without a doubt, he has a double discourse ”, explained Agnès Maltais.
“While calling for a calm and measured debate, the Prime Minister cannot help but add fuel to the fire by suggesting that being a federalist is proof of openness. This is low partisanship! Justin Trudeau, symbol par excellence of Canadian federalism, legitimizes unacceptable remarks coming from religious radicals who totally deny the principle of equality between men and women, and the premier of Quebec is unable to denounce it; this clearly shows that Philippe Couillard confuses respect for Quebec&#39;s common values with his partisan interests, ”concluded Carole Poirier.
