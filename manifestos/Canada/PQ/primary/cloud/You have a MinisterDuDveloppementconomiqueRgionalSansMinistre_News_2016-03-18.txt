Quebec - The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of regional development, Gaétan Lelièvre, the member for Rimouski, Harold LeBel, and the member for Bonaventure, Sylvain Roy, questioned, this morning, the minister responsible for regional economic development, Lise Thériault, to question her about her vision of the development of the regions of Quebec.
“Minister Thériault unfortunately demonstrated this morning her ignorance of regional development, which confirms our fears that no one in this government knows or defends the regions. We questioned the Minister about her projects, her programs, her vision for our regions, and we got no answer. The Minister was not even able to specify, in the appropriations and the 2016-2017 budget plan, the sums available to her to accomplish her task. Today, we received confirmation that his position as Minister responsible for Regional Economic Development is an empty shell, ”said Gaétan Lelièvre.
“The Liberal government&#39;s cuts have deprived the regions of Quebec of their development tools. More than $ 180 million was formerly dedicated to regional development, aid to devitalized territories, rural agents, etc. Last year, the envelope was cut by 60% and we learned yesterday in the 2016-2017 budget that this cut was now permanent ”, denounced Sylvain Roy.
“The Institut de la statistique du Québec recently published alarming data on the demography of our regions. All of the resource regions have seen their population decline over the past year. It is not surprising, when we have a government which continues to demonstrate its ignorance of the regions. This morning we had proof that a minister without a ministry, without a portfolio, without a program and without a vision will not be able to resolve anything whatsoever to the problems experienced by the regions, ”concluded Harold LeBel.
