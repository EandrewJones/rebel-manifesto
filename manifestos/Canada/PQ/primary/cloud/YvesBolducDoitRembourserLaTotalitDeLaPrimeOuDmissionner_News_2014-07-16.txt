Québec, July 16, 2014 - The Member for Taschereau and House Leader of the Official Opposition, Agnès Maltais, and the Member for Taillon and spokesperson for health and access to care, Diane Lamarre, consider reimbursement insufficient what would the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Yves Bolduc, do. According to them, the minister must reimburse his entire bonus of $ 215,000 or take the only other necessary decision: resign.
“After defending his minister and talking about a storm in a glass of water, the Prime Minister admitted that his minister was reckless in taking care of 1,600 patients. He then spoke of guidelines for part-time work for MPs and said the bonus system was missing its mark. Philippe Couillard must stop denying the obvious and demand the total reimbursement of the premium, ”said Agnès Maltais.
By proposing to reimburse only the amount that the RAMQ will claim from him and to give the equivalent to an organization, the Minister is only complying with the administrative rule concerning patient follow-up and not the very spirit of the premium, which is to encourage a patient care.
“This case could have been settled as soon as we raised the issue in the National Assembly. Paying back part is not enough; it is all of the 1,600 patients of Minister Bolduc who no longer has a doctor, who is not taken care of and who must now find another doctor. The more time passes, the less the population understands the resistance of the Minister, who must act in a responsible and exemplary manner, ”continued Diane Lamarre.
