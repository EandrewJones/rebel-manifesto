Quebec - During an interpellation held today in the National Assembly, the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and official opposition critic for elementary and secondary education and school perseverance, Nicole Léger, confronted the Minister of Education, Recreation and Sport, Yves Bolduc, on his lack of consistency and his many test balls.
“The minister seems to be doing everything to try to divert attention from his multiple failures. Does he hope that we forget that he always has to reimburse his premium? That he accepts that the cuts directly affect services to students, in particular those intended for the most disadvantaged? That every day, new cuts are added? ”Asked Nicole Léger.
Homework help, school adaptation, food aid, purchase of books in libraries, school transport ... the list of cuts in schools continues to grow. Today, Minister Yves Bolduc continued to say that it is essential that student services are not affected, but that is not what is happening on the ground. Despite the multiple requests that Nicole Léger addressed to him, the minister refused to engage with school boards to restore the situation.
“The minister sent schools a list telling them where to cut. Now he is denying his responsibility. In accordance with the Liberal approach, it is everyone&#39;s fault, except that of the main party concerned. More than ever, Yves Bolduc is proving that he is a rough pupil, with multiple failures. He must leave the Ministry of Education, after having reimbursed his premium of $ 215,000, ”concluded Nicole Léger.
