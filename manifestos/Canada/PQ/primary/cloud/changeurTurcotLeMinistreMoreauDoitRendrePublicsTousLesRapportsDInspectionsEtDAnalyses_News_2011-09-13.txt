Montreal - The MNA for Gouin and official opposition spokesperson for transport, Nicolas Girard, urges the new Minister of Transport, Pierre Moreau, to make public the reports and documents relating to the Turcot interchange. &quot;Minister Moreau promised to establish a culture of transparency: that he goes from words to deeds&quot;, declared Nicolas Girard.
In a response to an access to information request, the Parti Québécois discovered that last March, the Quebec Ministry of Transport (MTQ) authorized an additional $ 4.5 million to the SNC-Lavalin consortium. / Cima + / Dessau commissioned to monitor and inspect the Turcot interchange. Initially, the contract awarded was for $ 15 million. This is therefore an increase of 30% compared to the original contract.
“What justifies such a cost overrun? What did the consortium find that caused the bill to swell so much? Engineers produced reports and analyzes for the Ministère des Transports on the condition of the Turcot interchange. However, the public is still unaware of its content. These reports and analyzes must be made public to citizens. After all, it is the taxpayers who foot the bill, ”continued Nicolas Girard.
The member for Gouin recalled that last spring, the MTQ urgently closed lanes on the Turcot interchange. However, a few days later, we learned that the MTQ had not set the record straight on the real reasons for the closure.
“Gone are the days of spreading information in small quantities to avoid embarrassment. In the case of the Turcot interchange, the Liberal government has been negligent with its many years of indecision. Turcot, 300,000 vehicles every day use its 13 ramps. With such a high daily flow, it is the largest motorway junction in the metropolis. We have a right to the truth and we want to obtain it in the coming hours, not in the coming months, ”Nicolas Girard concluded.
