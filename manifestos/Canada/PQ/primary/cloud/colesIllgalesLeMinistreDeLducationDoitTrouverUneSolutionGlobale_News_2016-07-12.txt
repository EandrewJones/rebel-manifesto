Quebec - The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in matters of education and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, calls on the Minister of Education to find a comprehensive solution to solve the problem of illegal schools, which remains intact despite the increased budgets for homeschooling.
“Of course, we have to make sure that we provide better supervision at home school. This decision is not questioned, but it is certainly not a sufficient solution to the much larger problem of illegal schools. Minister Proulx has been trying to buy time and hide his government&#39;s improvisation on this issue for two years. Both former Minister Yves Bolduc and told him they lacked legislative tools to act. However, the government has just tabled Bill 105, which opens the Education Act, and there is absolutely nothing about illegal schools in this bill, ”said Alexandre Cloutier.
The member recalled that, for two years, the Liberal ministers have repeatedly excused their inaction by the expected tabling of a report from a ministerial committee on the issue of illegal schools. “The government promised us a report for September 2014. Almost two years later, we still have nothing, no portrait of the situation, no report, no additional legislative tool. Minister Proulx, however, admitted that he needed it to tackle the problem. Meanwhile, hundreds of young Quebeckers continue to be deprived of an education in accordance with the pedagogical regime, ”lamented the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
