Quebec - In response to the aerial tragedy that occurred today in the Magdalen Islands, the Leader of the Official Opposition and Member of Parliament for Saint-Jérôme, Pierre Karl Péladeau, made the following statement:
“More than sadness, it is the incomprehension as well as a deep feeling of injustice which inhabits us in these difficult times, whereas several members of the same family as well as a crew perished during a same accident. We are of course thinking of the affected families and the people of the Islands. On behalf of the entire Parti Québécois team, I offer my sincere condolences to the loved ones of the victims of this tragedy. Our thoughts are with you.
In particular, I would like to express my deepest sympathy to those close to Jean Lapierre and his wife, Nicole Beaulieu. Mr. Lapierre was a politician and a political analyst respected as much by the population, artisans in the media world as by politicians. We could feel his deep love for politics, for its cogs and for those who made the choice of public service. In all circumstances, he commented on the news with a contagious passion, a colorful vocabulary and an outspokenness that defined him so well. Over the years, Jean Lapierre has established himself as an outstanding popularizer and an essential political communicator. The public appreciated Jean Lapierre, and the latter, accessible and generous, gave him back. Today we are losing a voice and a face that we loved and that we will miss. Jean Lapierre, hi, hi! &quot;
