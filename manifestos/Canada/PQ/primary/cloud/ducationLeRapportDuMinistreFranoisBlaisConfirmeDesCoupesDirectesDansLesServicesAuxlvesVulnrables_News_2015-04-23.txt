Quebec - The member for Chicoutimi and leader of the official opposition, Stéphane Bédard, and the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles and spokesperson for elementary and secondary education, Nicole Léger, ask the government to be clear with Quebec parents on the impact of its drastic cuts on student services.
For three days now, the Minister of Education and the Prime Minister have been claiming that the report by the firm Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton concerning the Commission scolaire de Montréal (CSDM) proves that we can make cuts in education without affecting student services. . However, this report, made public this morning by the official opposition, proposes, in order to meet the government&#39;s budgetary expectations, to cut the positions of 75 teachers in special schools, 27 technicians in special education, and even 8 students with disabilities, among others.
“In all, the report that the Minister of Education has been apologizing for since Tuesday suggests that we thank 221 professionals who provide daily services to our children, particularly those with learning disabilities. How can the government claim that there will be no impact on education services, when the report it has commissioned itself proposes to cut teaching positions and increase the number students per class? », Asked Stéphane Bédard.
We can read, in a letter sent to the parents of the Commission scolaire de Laval, this week, that schools will be forced to &quot;cut at least $ 16 million in their budget&quot; and that this will &quot;inevitably affect student services&quot;.
“So it&#39;s not just the CSDM that comes to the conclusion that the government is imposing service cuts. How will the Prime Minister go about explaining to these 75,000 parents that in Quebec, we have money to increase doctors&#39; salaries by $ 327 million, but that we don&#39;t have any? to maintain services for children in schools? ”, Added Nicole Léger.
