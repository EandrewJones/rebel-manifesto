Shawinigan - The Premier of Quebec, Pauline Marois, accompanied by the Minister for Industrial Policy and the Quebec Economic Development Bank, Élaine Zakaïb, today announced the creation, in the long term, of around 100 jobs at AddÉnergie in Shawinigan.
This project, which represents an investment of nearly $ 21 million over five years, will benefit from a $ 5 million loan from the Government of Quebec for the establishment of an assembly plant for electric vehicle charging stations.
“The Transportation Electrification Strategy, which is part of our economic policy, is one of the major initiatives my government has launched to create jobs and support the economy. We want to quickly make more room for electric vehicles, but also make Quebec a model to follow in the field of transportation electrification. The products and software offered by AddÉnergie are innovative and of remarkable quality, exactly the type of Quebec success that must be promoted around the world, ”said Pauline Marois.
With this new plant, AddÉnergie wishes to integrate all the assembly operations of its terminals as well as the management of its inventories in the same place. Thus, the company will improve its ability to meet the needs of its new customers, in order to penetrate the North American and world markets, and to contribute to the increase of our exports.
“Today&#39;s announcement sends a strong signal about the future of the electric transportation industry in Quebec. With its plant project in Shawinigan, AddÉnergie creates jobs in the regions and clearly demonstrates the ability of Quebec entrepreneurs to embark on projects for the future. With the financial support of our government, AddÉnergie will strengthen its position as a leader in Quebec and Canada in the manufacture of charging stations in a booming market, ”said Élaine Zakaïb.
