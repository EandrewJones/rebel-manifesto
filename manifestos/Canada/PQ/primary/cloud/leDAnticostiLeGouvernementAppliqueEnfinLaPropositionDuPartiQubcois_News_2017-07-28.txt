Québec, July 28, 2017– The official opposition spokesperson for energy and natural resources, Sylvain Rochon, is delighted that the Liberal government has finally decided to apply Jean-François Lisée&#39;s proposal by putting end of the work on Anticosti Island and by entering into an agreement with certain companies concerned. However, he deplores the inconsistency of the Liberals, who adopted under gag order a law that opens the door to the exploitation of hydrocarbons everywhere else in Quebec.
IN SHORT
“Philippe Couillard has let uncertainty hang for too long with Anticosti. We have been asking him for more than a year to put an end to the work and to reach an agreement with the companies concerned. We are delighted that the government agrees with our arguments and finally hears reason, ”declared Sylvain Rochon.
“That said, we must not forget that barely a few months ago, the Liberals adopted, under gag order, a law that opens the door to the exploitation of shale gas in the St. Lawrence Valley. The government has also refused the protection of the Gaspé bays in its law on hydrocarbons. So we must protect Anticosti, but not the Bay of Gaspé? It is not just the citizens of Anticosti who were waiting for answers from the Liberal government. Citizens elsewhere in Quebec also want to know whether or not there will be oil or gas activity permitted in their community, and under what conditions. We know the answer for Anticosti, we now need the answer for the remaining 99.99% of the Quebec population, ”added the deputy.
“Today, the Liberals are playing politics by announcing the end of oil activities on Anticosti Island. They make it a symbol. But Quebec is not just Anticosti. In the rest of Quebec, the Liberals have opened an even wider door for the oil companies. When it comes to energy and the environment, Philippe Couillard adopts a “green” discourse. In reality, it is an environmental dunce, ”concluded Sylvain Rochon.
