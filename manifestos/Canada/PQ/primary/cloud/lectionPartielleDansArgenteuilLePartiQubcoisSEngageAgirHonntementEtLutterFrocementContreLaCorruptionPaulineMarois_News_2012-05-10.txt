Lachute - The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, today inaugurated the electoral office of the candidate of the Parti Québécois, Roland Richer, in view of the by-election on June 11.
Pauline Marois took advantage of the event to recall that the Parti Québécois is determined to clean up political mores and that it is proposing a series of measures in this direction. “In the Parti Québécois, we will act honestly and we will be intractable in our fight against corruption. To achieve this, we are notably proposing to reduce contributions to political parties to $ 100 per person, to establish fixed-date elections and to limit the number of terms of mayors and the prime minister. These changes require the election of the Parti Québécois, ”said Pauline Marois.
“Whether in terms of the economy, social solidarity, culture, health and the environment, the candidate presented by the Parti Québécois is clearly the best choice for the people of Argenteuil. Roland Richer is an honest and honest man who is there to serve the citizens, ”added Pauline Marois, recalling that this by-election is made necessary because of the resignation of David Whissel who left under allegations of conflicts of interest. .
“Quebecers need elected officials who are attentive, ready to discuss, flexible when the time comes to come to an understanding with citizens and inflexible in the face of corruption, patronage and federal attacks against our nation. What the Parti Québécois is proposing is clear: to assert itself, to enrich itself and to help each other, unlike the Liberal Party and the CAQ, which prefer to confront citizens and defend the interests of the privileged, ”concluded the Parti Québécois candidate, Roland Richer.
Remember that the Parti Québécois is the largest political force in Quebec with its 90,000 members.
