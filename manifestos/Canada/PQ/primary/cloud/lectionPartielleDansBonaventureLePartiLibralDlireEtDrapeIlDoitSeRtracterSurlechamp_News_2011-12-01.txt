Montreal -In a press release issued today, the Liberal Party lays serious accusations about the conduct of the Parti Québécois during the election campaign. They are all false and the PLQ, its president and its candidate know it very well. This tactic used by the PLQ is known to journalists and political observers. Moreover, in 2010 during the by-election in the riding of Kamouraska-Témiscouata, the PLQ used the media in the same way, with the same methods and perhaps the same individuals. All this one week before the end of the election campaign, just as he is doing today.
The people of Bonaventure are not fooled. They have known the ways of doing the PLQ to endure them for so many decades. What is in question is the integrity of the PLQ candidate, not that of the Parti Québécois candidate who is a fair and honest man.
It is Damien Arsenault who is singled out by the media for practices that are akin to nepotism. It is the PLQ that allowed the FIER Gaspésie to invest the money of the Gaspésiens in the Outaouais. It was the Liberal government that created the child care scandal and that converted the Ministry of Families and Children into the Liberal Ministry of Families. That Damien Arsenault and the PLQ do not want us to talk about their record and their actions, we can understand them. However, that does not allow them to invent just anything.
In addition, the Parti Québécois would like to remind the Liberal Party that with regard to the advertising campaign launched this week, all checks have been made and agreements made with the CEO. The PQ will pay the part involved in this campaign.
The Parti Québécois asks the president of the PLQ, Marc Tanguay, to retract immediately for his false accusations.
