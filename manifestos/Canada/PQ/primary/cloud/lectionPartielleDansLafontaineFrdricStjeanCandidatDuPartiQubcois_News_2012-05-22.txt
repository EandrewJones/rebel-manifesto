Montreal - The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has formalized the candidacy of Frédéric St-Jean for the by-election in the riding of LaFontaine. “Frédéric is a brilliant young man who is part of the next generation in politics. Integral and honest, Frédéric will be able to support the proposals and positions of the Parti Québécois with dynamism and frankness during this election. &quot;
“If we are in a by-election today, it is because the Liberal MP for the riding got caught up in a series of scandals. We talked about favoritism in the granting of child care licenses and the use of a private company credit card while he was in office. Seeing the lack of consideration for ethics and democracy in Jean Charest&#39;s party, the behavior of the liberal deputy must not go unpunished. I will use the platform that is offered to me to recall the ethical abuses of the Liberals. Corruption must stop, ”said Frédéric St-Jean.
&quot;Patronage, collusion, worrying links with the oil industry, shale gas, the scandal of daycare centers, the health tax, the Îlot Voyageur, the Turcot interchange, the CHUM, dinners with members of crime organized, the liberal organizers arrested as part of the UPAC investigation, the examples are multiplying. This government is behaving in a delinquent manner and its attitude on the issue of tuition fees has dragged Quebec into a real social crisis. We have to put an end to all this. It has lasted long enough and I present myself in LaFontaine to help restore integrity in politics, ”he added.
Frédéric St-Jean, who is a technical advisor at the Société d&#39;habitation du Québec, explained that only the Parti Québécois is proposing a democratic reform that will make it possible to clean up Quebec political mores, in particular by lowering the limit on donations to political parties to 100 dollars and establishing fixed-date elections.
Remember that the Parti Québécois is the largest political force with its 90,000 members.
