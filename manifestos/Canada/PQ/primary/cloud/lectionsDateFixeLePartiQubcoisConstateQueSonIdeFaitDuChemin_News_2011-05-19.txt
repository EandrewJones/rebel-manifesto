Quebec - The MP for Joliette and official opposition critic for justice, Véronique Hivon, notes that the idea of the Parti Québécois to put forward fixed-date elections in Quebec continues to gain support.
“The bill presented by MP Khadir today on fixed date elections is a proposal that emanates from the new program of the Parti Québécois. This is one of the key elements of the actions we are proposing to restore citizens&#39; confidence in their institutions and their elected representatives in order to better serve democracy, ”declared Véronique Hivon.
She also stresses that the Parti Québécois&#39; proposal goes further and suggests that in the case of a by-election the maximum time limit to trigger the election is no longer six months, but only 90 days.
“The Liberal Party of Quebec wants to serve its interests before those of Quebecers; the chances that this bill will be adopted by Jean Charest are therefore zero. A Parti Québécois government will be needed for such a project to be carried out, ”concluded Véronique Hivon.
