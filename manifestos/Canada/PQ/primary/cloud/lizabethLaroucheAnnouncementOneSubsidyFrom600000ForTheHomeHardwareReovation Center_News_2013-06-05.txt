Quebec - The Minister for Native Affairs, Ms. Élizabeth Larouche, announces the granting of financial assistance of $ 617,936 for the relaunch of the Home Hardware Maniwaki renovation center. The company is a major employer in the region.
&quot;This investment should help consolidate nearly twenty jobs in the Algonquin community of Kitigan Zibi, in addition to making the company more competitive in its niche and boosting regional economic development,&quot; said the Minister. Larouche.
Thanks to this grant, the owner of the renovation center will make a series of significant improvements to his business. In addition to updating its fleet of trucks and its computer network, it will develop a garden space in order to offer new products popular with customers. In addition, the entire store display will be reviewed in order to provide its product line with better visibility.
“The demand for hardware and building materials is ever increasing. It comes from indigenous communities, but also from non-indigenous residents of neighboring regions. I hope that this investment will make it possible to meet demand and that it can have a leverage effect in the area of construction in the region, ”said the Minister.
Financial assistance for the Renovation Center comes from the Native Initiatives Fund of the Native Affairs Secretariat. The objective of this fund is to support projects that could have significant spinoffs on the economic, social or community development of the Aboriginal nations of Quebec.
