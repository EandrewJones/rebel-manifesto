Val-d&#39;Or– The MNA for Abitibi-Est and Minister responsible for Native Affairs, Ms. Élizabeth Larouche, participated this morning in the annual conference of the Cree Abitibi-Témiscamingue Nation Economic Alliance Secretariat. The event, which was in its eleventh edition, was held at the Eskers Congress Center in the city of Amos.
“The Cree Nation Abitibi-Témiscamingue Economic Alliances Secretariat is a concrete example of sharing and exchange between business people from the Abitibi-Témiscamingue and Nord-du-Québec regions, the Cree communities and many stakeholders. I am very happy to have taken part in the discussion, ”declared Minister Larouche.
In an intervention that focused on creativity and innovation in relations between the Crees and Quebec, Ms. Larouche reiterated the priority given by her government to dialogue and harmonious relations with the First Nations and the Inuit. In front of an audience of over 200 people, she cited as an example the historic agreement signed last July between the Crees of James Bay and the Government of Quebec: &quot;The Agreement on Governance in the Eeyou Territory Istchee Baie-James provides for the creation of a governance model based on collaboration, social harmony and a common interest in fostering partnership on the development of the region, ”the Minister indicated.
&quot;In economic terms, the creation of the Northern Development Secretariat and the close collaboration between the latter and the Native Affairs Secretariat will maximize the positive spinoffs for the communities as well as for all Quebecers,&quot; added Ms. Larouche.
Under the theme of Creativity and Innovation, the eleventh edition of the annual conference of the Secrétariat aux alliances économique Nation Cree Abitibi-Témiscamingue brought together speakers and participants from the business world, Cree nations, academia, administrations regional and municipal as well as government representatives.
