Reacting to the tabling of the document Update on Quebec&#39;s economic and financial situation by the Minister of Finance, the spokesperson for the second opposition group in matters of finance and for the Treasury Board, Martin Ouellet, can only note important gaps. “The CAQ government does not consider it urgent to invest in student services, health care or even support for seniors living in CHSLDs,” he illustrated at the outset.
IN SHORT
· The CAQ does not devote a single page of its statement to improving services in education, health or the elderly.
· For the Parti Québécois, the urgency is to hire professionals for the students and nurses to relieve congestion in hospitals, and to ensure two baths per week in CHSLDs.
· The “family tax” is maintained at 100%.
· Daycare prices will increase for all parents as of January.
· The CAQ has made its choice: repairing the damage caused by liberal austerity will wait until later.
The economic statement tabled by the CAQ government in fact does not contain any measures aimed at improving the services offered to Quebecers. “Today, François Legault confirms that for him, investing in health, education and seniors services is not a priority. During the election campaign, he said, however, that it was possible to finance his promises while reinvesting in services. He quickly realized that he had to make a choice and, from now on, we know it: repairing the damage caused by liberal austerity will have to wait, ”continued Martin Ouellet.
In the eyes of the Parti Québécois, the urgency is rather to invest sums to ensure that students in difficulty have access to professionals - remedial teachers, psychoeducators, social workers, etc. -, to hire nurses to relieve congestion in hospitals, and to offer two baths per week to seniors in CHSLDs, for example.
The spokesperson also points out that what the CAQ announced today is proving to be much less generous than what had been promised during the election campaign. “The CAQ undertook, in particular, to cancel the additional contribution for childcare. Today, the Caquista government is backing down. The &quot;family tax&quot; will continue to apply at 100%. In addition, during the election campaign, the CAQ promised an annual allowance of $ 2,472 for the second and third children. Compared to this commitment, today&#39;s announcement represents a shortfall of $ 737 for a family of two children, and $ 1,474 for a family of three children, ”he continued.
Let us also recall that in the election campaign, the CAQ forgot - by the Prime Minister&#39;s own admission - to commit to putting money back in the wallets of seniors. “The Parti Québécois, for its part, had promised to set up a refundable tax credit for seniors aged 70 and over. Even if the measure that the CAQ has just announced is less generous than the one we had planned, I salute the gesture of the government, which was inspired by it and which is implementing such a tax credit. The Minister of Finance can be assured of my full cooperation if he wishes to apply other proposals from the Parti Québécois! », Concluded Martin Ouellet.
