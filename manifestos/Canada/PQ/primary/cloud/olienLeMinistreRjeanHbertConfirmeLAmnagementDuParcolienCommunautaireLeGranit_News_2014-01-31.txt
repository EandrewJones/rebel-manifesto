Quebec - The Minister of Health and Social Services, Minister responsible for Seniors and Minister responsible for the Estrie region, Mr. Réjean Hébert, on behalf of the Minister of Natural Resources, Ms. Martine Ouellet, announces the government authorization for the realization of the Le Granit community wind project in the Estrie region.
With a total capacity of 24.6 MW, this wind farm will have 12 Senvion wind turbines with a capacity of 2.05 MW each and will provide clean energy to 3,600 homes in the region. The development of this park, estimated at $ 60 million, should generate 70 jobs during the construction phase and will be commissioned in December 2014.
“As Minister responsible for the Estrie region, I am delighted with the project announced today. While respecting the environment and the quality of life of residents, this project will help revive the economic development of the MRC du Granit, which was greatly affected by the tragedy of July 6. This project is all the more promising for the region as the majority of the municipalities in this MRC are stakeholders ”, underlined Réjean Hébert.
The Le Granit community wind project is the result of the third call for tenders for 500 MW of wind power reserved for community or aboriginal projects launched in 2009 by Hydro-Québec Distribution. This third call for tenders provides in particular that, of the $ 60 million related to the project, a minimum of $ 36 million must be invested in Quebec, including $ 12.6 million in the Gaspé and in the MRC of La Matanie.
“Wind energy in Quebec helps consolidate nearly 2,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector, more specifically in the Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspésie region,” said Martine Ouellet.
