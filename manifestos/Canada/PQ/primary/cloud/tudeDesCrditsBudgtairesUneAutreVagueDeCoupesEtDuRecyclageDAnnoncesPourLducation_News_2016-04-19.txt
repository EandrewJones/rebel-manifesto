Quebec - During the study of the budget appropriations of the Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sport, the MP for Pointe-aux-Trembles, Nicole Léger, demonstrated that the supposed reinvestment in education announced by the Couillard government was, in fact, financed by a new wave of cuts in the network or by envelopes already announced by the former Minister of Education, François Blais, in November 2015.
“Minister Sébastien Proulx keeps saying that he will inject $ 109 million in new money into the education system this year. Unfortunately, if we dig a little deeper, we see that $ 39 million of this supposed reinvestment is financed by administrative optimization measures, which means, in non-governmental language, that the network will have to make other cuts. As for the remaining $ 70 million, they had already been announced by François Blais last November. In short, the budget tabled in March did not in fact include any new amount for 2016-2017, ”said Nicole Léger.
The member indicates that these new cuts of $ 39 million will result in direct cuts in student services. “During the study of appropriations, the Minister of Education refused to make a commitment that there would be no further cuts in student services in 2016-2017. However, we know that the leeway in the network has been exhausted by the budget cuts of the past two years. Already, hundreds of positions for professionals and technicians in special education have been abolished in Quebec, among others. The minister must come to his senses. The network told us, it has had enough. He no longer has any margin and he will not be able to cash $ 39 million in further cuts. It is the success of our young people that is at stake, ”added Nicole Léger.
