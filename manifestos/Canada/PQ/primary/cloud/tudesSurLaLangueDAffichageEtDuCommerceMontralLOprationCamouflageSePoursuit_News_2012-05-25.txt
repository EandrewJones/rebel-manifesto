Quebec - The member for Drummond and official opposition spokesperson for language, Yves-François Blanchet, denounces the camouflage operation of the minister responsible for the application of the Charter of the French language, Christine St-Pierre , concerning studies on the language of display and commerce in Montreal.
The daily La Presse revealed this morning that these studies are ready and must be made public next month. “For weeks, Minister St-Pierre has been claiming that the studies were not completed. However, they were sufficient for a crisis management mandate to be given to someone close to the Prime Minister, Luc Ouellet, of the public relations firm National six months ago. It smacks of the camouflage operation, ”denounced Yves-François Blanchet.
For the Parti Québécois, there is an ethical problem due to the fact that studies are currently accessible to a lobbyist close to Jean Charest before parliamentarians. “Jean Charest&#39;s contempt for our democratic institutions no longer needs to be demonstrated. In this case, there are two things: either Minister St-Pierre has no idea what is going on in her organization because for her and her government the protection of the language is trivial, or we are trying to control the damage because the government fears that its negligence will be revealed, ”continued the deputy.
The spokesperson for the Parti Québécois therefore demands that these studies, which have been in the hands of the OQLF for weeks, perhaps months, be made public. “Minister St-Pierre can no longer pretend that studies do not exist. Christine St-Pierre must answer to the National Assembly of Quebec, not to the friends of Jean Charest, ”concluded Yves-François Blanchet.
