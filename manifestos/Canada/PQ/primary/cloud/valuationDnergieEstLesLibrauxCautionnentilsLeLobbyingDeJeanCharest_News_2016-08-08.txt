Quebec - The member for Sanguinet and spokesperson for the Parti Québécois in energy and natural resources, Alain Therrien, as well as the member for Verchères and spokesperson for Quebec-Canada relations, Stéphane Bergeron, question the credibility of the National Energy Board (NEB) when it comes to evaluating the Energy East project.
“We learned that the NEB withheld information about a meeting that took place between its president and Jean Charest, when the latter was a lobbyist for TransCanada. This secret meeting confirms, once again, that Quebec must not let a federal body decide for it. This pipeline project is not trivial; it would cross our territory, ”recalled the deputy for Sanguinet.
“The Liberals must tell Quebeckers the truth: do they agree or disagree with Energy East? What do Philippe Couillard and his ministers think of the lobbying carried out by Jean Charest, their former leader? “, Also questioned Alain Therrien.
“It is up to Quebeckers to decide whether the pipeline project should see the light of day or not. To entrust this important decision to a federal agency, which hides information, constitutes a danger. And that is certainly not how we obtain the confidence and support of a population, ”concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
