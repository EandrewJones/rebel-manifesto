Quebec - While citizens of Quebec are exempt from paying all of their taxes to Revenu Quebec due to agreements with the federal government, the leader of the official opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, has asked the Prime Minister to take its responsibilities for the application of Quebec tax laws.
“Tax evasion is a social and economic scourge. In recent years, 34 OECD countries have started work to combat it. But it seems there is an exception: Canada. And Quebec is behind Ottawa. As a result, while the Liberal government of Philippe Couillard imposes tax increases on families and increases the tax on SMEs, we learn that around twenty KPMG clients, who have hidden money in the Isle of Man , will be able to get away with it, ”said Pierre Karl Péladeau.
“Yesterday, the Minister of Finance confirmed that because of agreements binding the government of Quebec to the federal government, $ 130 million passed under the nose of the tax will be the subject of a tax amnesty for the firm KPMG and its clients, despite Revenu Québec refusing to give up. Will Quebecers really have to pay for federal decisions that legitimize the tax abuses orchestrated by KPMG? », Insisted the leader of the official opposition.
“The Prime Minister said he was open to the idea of having the federal government manage and collect Quebec taxes. We can see this morning why that would be a big mistake. The Prime Minister must commit to never entrusting the administration and collection of our taxes to Ottawa, ”concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
