Quebec - The Minister of Public Security, Mr. Stéphane Bergeron, received the administrative investigation report from the Sûreté du Québec (SQ) Executive report on the Parti Québécois election night at Metropolis, following the events at Metropolis during the general elections of September 4.
The dramatic events that took place in Metropolis, killing one person and injuring another, raised many questions concerning the safety of public figures, and demonstrate that Quebec is not immune to an attack. &quot;I took note of the conclusions of the report and I received the formal assurance from the Director General of the Sûreté du Québec that all the necessary operational adjustments have been put in place, to face any new threat,&quot; declared Mr. Bergeron.
In order not to reveal the security methods taken by the police, and because of the ongoing legal proceedings, the content of the Sûreté du Québec report will not be made public. In addition, no additional comments from the Minister will be made in this matter.
Remember that the day after the Metropolis incident, the SQ launched an administrative investigation into the security measures that have been put in place. As is always the case in such a situation, the Coroner&#39;s Office is also conducting an investigation that will determine the causes and circumstances of the death of Mr. Denis Blanchette, a stage technician who was working during the event.
