Quebec- The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesman of the Parti Party in education and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, sum the Minister of Education to find a global solution to solve the problem of illegal schools, Which remains entirely despite the enhancement of the budgets dedicated to school at home. 
"Certainly, we must make sure to better supervise the school at home. This decision is not in question, but it is certainly not a sufficient solution to the much broader problem of illegal schools. Minister Proulx seeks to save time and camouflage the improvisation of his government in this file for two years. As much as the former minister Yves Bolduc that has told him to lack legislation to act. However, the government has just introduced Bill 105 that opens the law on public education, and there is absolutely nothing about illegal schools in this bill, "said Alexandre Cloutier. 
The hon. Member recalls that, for two years, the Liberal ministers have constantly excused their inaction by the expected deposit of a report of a ministerial committee on the issue of illegal schools. "The government promised us a report for September 2014. Nearly two years later, we still have nothing, no portrait of the situation, no report, no additional legislation. Minister Proulx, however, confessed to need to tackle the problem. Meanwhile, hundreds of young Quebeckers continue to be deprived of a teaching in accordance with the educational system, "deplored the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
