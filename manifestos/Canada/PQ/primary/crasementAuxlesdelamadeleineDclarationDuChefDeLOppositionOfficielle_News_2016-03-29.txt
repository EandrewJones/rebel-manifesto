Québec- In response to the aerial tragedy today in the Madeleine Islands, the official Leader of the official and deputy of Saint-Jérôme, Pierre Karl Péladeau, wanted to make the following statement: 
"More than sadness, it is misunderstanding and a deep feeling of injustice that live in these difficult times, while several members of the same family and a crew perished during a same accident. We believe, of course, affected families and island people. On behalf of the whole party of the Parti Québécois, I offer my sincere condolences to the relatives of the victims of this tragedy. Our thoughts are accompanying you. 
More particularly, I want to express my bright sympathy to the relatives of Jean Lapierre and his wife, Nicole Beaulieu. Mr. Lapierre has been a politician and a political analyst who has respected both the population, media craftsmen than women and politicians. We could feel his deep love for politics, for his workings and for those who have made the choice of public service. In all circumstances, he commented on the news with a contagious passion, a colorful vocabulary and a franc speak that defined it so well. With the years, Jean Lapierre has established himself as an outstanding popularizer and a unavoidable political communicator. The public appreciated Jean Lapierre, and this one, accessible and generous, made him well. We lose, today, a voice and a face we liked and we will miss. Jean Lapierre, Hi, Hi! »
