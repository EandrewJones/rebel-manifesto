Quebec- The member for Lac-Saint-Jean and spokesman for the Parti Party in education, research and school perseverance, Alexandre Cloutier, deplores the improvisation of the Liberal government when it comes to education in Quebec . 
"At the last General Council of his party, Prime Minister Couillard appeared as the Prime Minister of Education. This statement would have been encouraging if it had not been impossible to believe. Indeed, to see a Prime Minister positioning himself in the Savior of Education, while he is himself responsible for cuts in direct services to students, such as homework assistance, textbooks and support for students in Difficulty is surreal, "said the member for Lac-Saint-Jean. 
Let us remember that on the occasion of his opening speech, the Prime Minister had designated education as a priority of his government. However, despite everything, cups of hundreds of millions of dollars in schools, CEGEPs and universities were performed. 
"Today, how can we trust the government when it tells us about its ambitions about the success of young people? Once again, the approach it advocates is unorganized, improvised. However, we are very pleased to note that after two years and three ministers, including a Caquist, the brewing of structures that Bill 86 represented was abandoned to bet, finally, on academic success. But why is the government still unable to consult and work with the environment? Asked Alexander Cloutier. 
In addition, the government has absolutely announced nothing again with respect to kindergarten 4 years. "All he did is extend the pilot project that had been set up under the government of the Parti Québécois. Obviously, he tries to recycle existing programs to forget his compressions, "concluded the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
