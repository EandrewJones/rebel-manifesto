Quebec- Alexandre Cloutier, Member of Parliament for Lac-Saint-Jean and the official opposition spokesman for education, research and school perseverance, and the Parti Québécois supports the requests of the Quebec Student Union and The Collegiate Federation of Quebec with respect to the $ 80 million of federal funds expected by Quebec. 
"The Minister of Finance must first and foremost clarify what he intends to make of this money. He can not allow the doubt about the future of students. For the Québécois Party, it is clear that federal funds must be transferred to the Government of Quebec; Otherwise, it would be a federal intrusion into our fields of competence. The Government of Quebec must then give this money directly to students, enhanced the loan and scholarship program. This money should be used to ensure accessibility to studies, "said Alexandre Cloutier. 
"If the government decided to act otherwise, students would be doubly penalized. Indeed, federal tax credits for school and textbooks, which were accessible to Quebec students, were abolished by Ottawa, allowing the federal government to improve its scholarship program of $ 300 million. The money so spared must be reinvested in financial assistance to studies, "concluded the member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
