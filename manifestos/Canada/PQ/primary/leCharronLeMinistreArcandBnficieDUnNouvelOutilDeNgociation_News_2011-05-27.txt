Québec- MPs of Taillon, Marie Malavoy, Marguerite-d'youville, Monique Richard, and Vachon, Martine Ouellet, welcome the conclusions of the study report on the constraints, impacts and costs of a possible project Real estate on Charron Island carried out by researchers in urban studies of UQAM. This report was released by Nature Québec, the Montreal Regional Environment Council and the Friends of the Boucherville Islands National Park. 
The report carries new lighting on the file and reinforces the sense of urgency to prevent any real estate development on Charron Island, thus protecting the integrity of the Boucherville Islands National Park. "The report made public yesterday is unequivocal. The presence of wetlands, the projected increase in vehicles on the grounds of the park, the cost of infrastructure development, the nature of the current zoning are all elements that devaluate the field targeted by a real estate development project, "said Monique. Richard. 
"Moreover, this report is a significant bargaining element for the Minister of Sustainable Development, the Environment and Parks, Pierre Arcand, facing the current owner of the targeted ground. This is a major tool for the minister at six months of the second and final set of reserve, "said the spokesperson on the environment, sustainable development, parks and Water, Martine Ouellet. 
Last March, in a letter addressed to Minister Arcand, the Parti Québécois emphasized the importance for the government to document the impacts and impacts of building a real estate project on Charron Island. "Minister Arcand now has all the data confirming the environmental risks and the costs associated with such development. He must therefore act without delay! Marie Malavoy concluded.
