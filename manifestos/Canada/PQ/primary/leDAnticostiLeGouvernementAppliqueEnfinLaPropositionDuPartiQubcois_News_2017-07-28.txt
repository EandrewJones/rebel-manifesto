Quebec, July 28, 2017- The official opposition to the Energy and Natural Resources, Sylvain Rochon, is pleased that the Liberal government has finally decided to apply Jean-François Lisé by putting End to work on the island of Anticosti and concluding an agreement with certain companies concerned. He, however, deplores the inconsistency of the Liberals, who adopted under gagging a law that opens the door to the exploitation of hydrocarbons anywhere else in Quebec. 
IN SHORT 
"Philippe Couillard has let the uncertainty hang up for too long with Anticosti. It has been more than a year as we ask for an end to the work and to conclude an agreement with the companies concerned. We look forward to our arguments and finally agreed, "said Sylvain Rochon. 
"That said, we must not forget that only a few months ago, the Liberals adopted, under gag, a law that opens the door to the exploitation of shale gas in the St. Lawrence Valley. The government has also refused the protection of Gaspé berries in its hydrocarbon law. We must therefore protect Anticosti, but not the Bay of Gaspé? It is not just citizens of Anticosti who expected responses from the Liberal government. Citizens also in Quebec also want to know whether or not there will be oil or gas activity allowed in their community, under what conditions. We know the answer for Anticosti, we now need the remaining 99.99% of the Quebec population, "said the member. 
"Today, the Liberals make politics by announcing the end of the oil activities on the island of Anticosti. They make it a symbol. But Quebec, it's not just anticostic. In the rest of Quebec, the Liberals opened an even greater door to the oils. In terms of energy and environment, Philippe Couillard adopts a "green" speech. In reality, it is an environmental cencular, "concluded Sylvain Rochon.
