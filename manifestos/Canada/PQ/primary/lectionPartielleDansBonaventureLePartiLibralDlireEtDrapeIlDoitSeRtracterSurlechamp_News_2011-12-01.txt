Montreal -In a press release issued today, the Liberal Party carries serious charges on the conduct of the Quebecois party in the election campaign. They are all misleading and the PLQ, his president and his candidate know it very well. This tactic used by the PLQ is known journalists and observers from the political scene. Moreover, in 2010 during the partial election in the riding of Kamouraska-Témiscouata, the PLQ used the media in the same way, with the same methods and perhaps the same individuals. All this for a week of the end of the election campaign, exactly as it does today. 
Bonaventure people are not fooled. They know the ways to make PLQ for so many decades. What is involved is the integrity of the PLQ candidate, not that of the Québécois candidate who is a fair and honest man. 
Damien Arsenault is pointing with the media for practices that are similar to nepotism. This is the PLQ that has allowed the proud Gaspésie to invest the money of the Gaspésians in Outaouais. It was the Liberal government that created the daycare scandal and converted the Ministry of Family and Children in the Ministry of the Liberal Family. That Damien Arsenault and the PLQ do not want us to talk about their balance sheet and their actions, we can understand them. It does not allow them to invent anything. 
In addition, the Parti Québécois wishes to remind the Liberal Party that with respect to the advertising campaign launched this week, all checks have been made and the agreements made with the DGE. The PQ will pay the share involved in this campaign. 
The Parti Québécois asks the president of the PLQ, Marc Tanguay, to retract immediately for his false accusations.
