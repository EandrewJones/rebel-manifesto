Quebec - Member of Joliette and official opposition spokesman, Véronique Hivon, notes that the idea of the Parti Québécois to put forward elections on fixed date in Quebec continues to gain support. 
"The bill presented by MP Khadir today on fixed date elections is a proposal that comes from the new Parti Québécois program. This is one of the key elements of the actions we propose to restore confidence in citizens in their institutions and elected officials to better serve democracy, "said Véronique Hivon. 
It also stresses that the proposal of the Parti Québécois goes further and suggests that in the case of a partial election the maximum period to trigger the election is more than six months, but only 90 days. 
"The Liberal Party of Quebec wants to serve its interests before Quebeckers; The chances that this bill is adopted by Jean Charest are therefore null. It will take a government of the Parti Québécois so that such a project is realized, "has concluded Véronique Hivon.
