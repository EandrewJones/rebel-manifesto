Responding to the deposit of the document on the economic and financial situation of Quebec by the Minister of Finance, the Spokesman for the Second Financial Opposition Group and the Treasury Board, Martin Ouellet, can only see important gaps. "The CAQ government does not urgently consider investing in student services, health care or in supporting seniors living in CHSLD," he illustrated in the entry. 
IN SHORT 
· The CAQ does not devote a single page of its statement to improve education, health or seniors. 
· For the Québécois party, the urgency is to hire professionals for students and nurses to disengorge hospitals, and ensure two baths a week in CHSLD. 
· The "Family Tax" is kept 100%. 
· Day care rates will increase for all parents in January. 
· The CAQ made its choice: repair the damage caused by liberal austerity will wait until later. 
The Economic Statement filed by the Government of the CAQ does not contain any measures aimed at improving the services offered to Quebecers. "Today, François Legault confirms that for him, investing in health services, education and seniors, it is not a priority. In election campaign, however, he claimed that it was possible to finance his promises while reinvesting in services. He quickly realized that he had to make a choice and, from now on, we know him: the repair of the damage caused by liberal austerity will have to wait, "continued Martin Ouellet. 
In the eyes of the Parti Québécois, the urgency is rather to invest money to provide students with difficulty access to professionals - orthopedagogues, psychoeducators, social workers, etc. -, to hire nurses to disengorge hospitals, and offer two baths a week to seniors in CHSLD, for example. 
The spokesman also points out that what the CAQ has announced today is much less generous than what had been promised in the election campaign. "The CAQ had committed, in particular, to cancel the additional contribution to child care. Today, the Calculator government declines. The "Family Tax" will continue to apply 100%. In addition, in election campaign, the CAQ promised an annual allowance of $ 2472 for the second and third children. Compared to this commitment, today's announcement represents a $ 737 shortfall for a family of two children, and $ 1474 for a family of three children, "he continued. 
Let us also remember that in election campaign, the CAQ had forgotten - the very admission of the Prime Minister - to commit to putting money back into the seniors' portfolio. "The Parti Québécois, Him, had promised to set up a refundable tax credit for seniors 70 years of age and older. Even though the measure that the CAQ has just announced is less generous than the one we had planned, I salute the gesture of the government, which has been inspired and sets up such a tax credit. The Minister of Finance can be assured of my own collaboration if he wishes to apply other Québécois proposals! ", Concluded Martin Ouellet.
