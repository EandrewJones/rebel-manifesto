The team that Pauline Marois gathered for the April 7 elections is one of the most imposing, competent and convinced that Quebec had the opportunity to see. A star team, nothing less than expatient. And this, in all the fields of activity of Quebec society. 
Pauline Marois presented today his economic team and, let's say it frankly, she brought together the strongest economic team in Quebec's history: 
Candidatures of this quality, we can understand that it makes envious! Even the former Liberal Minister of Justice, Marc Bellemare, intends to vote for the Parti Québécois. 
This unprecedented team will work on a simple and clear goal: a stronger and more prosperous Quebec. 
In 18 months to the government, we fought against corruption and collusion, housed in our public finances by rigorous control of expenditure and developed an ambitious job creation policy: economic policy priority, growth-oriented economic and job creation. 
Stimulating the Québec economy and job creation, support entrepreneurs in Quebec and its successors, keep our head offices, encourage the development of expertise and the training of our workforce. Our goal is simple: a stronger, more prosperous, more independent Quebec. 
With Pauline Marois and his star team, beautiful days are offered for the Quebec economy! 
Surrounded by his economic team, the Quebec Prime Minister and Head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, announces that a government of the Parti Québécois will adopt measures to promote the retention of headquarters in Quebec. 
In order to propose adapted measures, the government has set up the Quebec Protection Working Group, led by Claude Séguin, Senior Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Investments at CGI.
