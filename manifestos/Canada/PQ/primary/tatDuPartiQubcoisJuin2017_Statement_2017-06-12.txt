At the National Council of June 11, I had the opportunity to speak to draw up the state of health of our political training. As you will see in the following charts, the regeneration of the Parti Québécois is underway and I am proud of the renewal that takes place in our ranks. 
First of all, the Parti Québécois has more members than all other political parties in Quebec. For a year, it's been 12,500 people who have joined us for the first time in their lives. We welcome them! 
Of course, the scope of our political training is not limited to its members. Online, in the digital space, our tools allow to relay the message directly to many of our fellow citizens. Whether it's on my Facebook page, with my Twitter account or those of the party, we are able to join more than 340,000 people directly. With you, we can constitute a real force of massive persuasion! 
Here, in the form of chart, the scope of our social networks added, compared to that of other political courses: 
Finally, to conclude on the status of the Parti Québécois, we must emphasize the exceptional work of the activists and activists in terms of funding. Our political training is based on popular financing, that is, on a multitude of donations of small amounts from all donors from all walks of life. This vision has always been brought by the Parti Québécois, since its founding, by René Lévesque, until today. 
As you will see in the following table, the Parti Québécois alone raises more than 50% of all contributions made to political parties since the beginning of the year: 
The Parti Québécois is therefore in excellent health. As October 2018, we can be proud of, because we have the opportunity to rely on strong, rooted political training in all regions of Quebec and whose attraction power remains as high.
