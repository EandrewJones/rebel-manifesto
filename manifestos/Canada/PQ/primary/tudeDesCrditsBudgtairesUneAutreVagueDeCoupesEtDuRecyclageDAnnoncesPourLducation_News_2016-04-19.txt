Québec- During the study of the budgetary appropriations of the Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sport, the member for Pointe-aux-Trembles, Nicole Léger, demonstrated that the supposed reinvestment in education announced by the Couillard was, in fact, financed by a new wave of cuts in the network or by envelopes already announced by the former Minister of Education, François Blais, in November 2015. 
"Minister Sebastien Proulx continues to say that he will inject $ 109 million with new money into the education system this year. Unfortunately, by digging a little, we realize that $ 39 million from this supposed reinvestment is funded by administrative optimization measures, which means, in non-governmental language, that the network will have to make other sections. As for the $ 70 million remaining, they had already been announced by François Blais last November. In short, the budget tabled in March did not understand any new sum for the year 2016-17, "said Nicole Léger. 
The hon. Member indicates that these new cuts of $ 39 million will result in direct cuts in student services. "In the study of the appropriations, the Minister of Education refused to commit to that there are no new sections in student services in 2016-2017. However, we know that room for maneuver in the network have been exhausted by budget cuts for the last two years. Already, hundreds of professionals of professionals and technicians in special education have been abolished in Quebec, among others. The minister must come back to the reason. The network told us, it has enough. He has no margin and he can not cash $ 39 million new cuts. This is the success of our young people who are at stake, "added Léger Nicole.
