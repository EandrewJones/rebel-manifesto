Quebec- On the occasion of the study of Treasury Board and Government Administration's 2016-2017 Budget Credits, Capital-Government, Leader of the Official Opposition and Party Spokesman for the region of The Capitale-Nationale, Pierre Karl Péladeau, as well as Maltese Maler, MP for Taschereau and the Deputy Parliamentary Leader of the Official Opposition, tried, in vain, to obtain answers from the Minister responsible for the Capitale-Nationale Region , François Blais, about the ambitions of the Liberals for Quebec and his region. They also demonstrated the effects of liberal austerity on its economic vitality. 
"There was a loss of 6500 jobs last March in the Quebec Metropolitan area. It's enormous! Currently, there are fewer jobs in this territory than in 2014. In addition, following the closure of the Cré, we noted a Cup of $ 355,000 in the budgets dedicated to attraction, at the Home, the integration and establishment of immigrants. This situation is deplorable, especially since the minister responsible for the region, François Blais, does not know his records, despite two years at the Council of Ministers and his title of deputy of Charlesbourg, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"Several other sectors, such as culture, must also deal with alarming compressions. We also observed a lack of transparency in the refusal of Minister Blais to file the vision set out by the National Capital Commission for New Barracks, "added Agnès Maltese. 
"Our questions remained unanswered. Despite several hours spent in committee, I still do not see what is the economic development vision of this government for the capital. On the contrary, it abolishes development tools, resulting in falling employment figures. All this, added to the rapid replacement of the minister responsible for the national capital, creates a paralysis that will not arrange the situation for the region, "concluded the head of the official opposition.
