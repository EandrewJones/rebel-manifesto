Québec- During the study of health budget appropriations, the spokesperson for the Québécois health and accessibility of care, Diane Lamarre, presented to the Minister of Health, Gaétan Barrette, a portrait of the Access to mental health services obtained through access to information, and findings are worrying. 
"More than one in four people who have had access to services this year had to wait more than 30 days, targets that the minister himself had fixed in his 2015-2020 Action Plan. In some areas, the numbers are even more troubling: in Montérégie, 29% of people waited more than a month for a first service. In the Laurentians, the proportion rises to 43%, "the hon. Member said. 
"While the minister announced a pomp a mental health action plan and $ 70 million in 5-year investments, we had confirmation that no dollar will really be invested until 2018, not a say before the next election. to improve access for patients. It is extremely disappointing, "Diane Lamarre continued. 
"The minister has not even been able to appoint a single concrete action to undertake to remedy this problem. We have suggested, as a solution, to bet on future psychologists who complement their seventh and final year of boarding school: by paying them and encouraging them to practice in the public network, there is a real possibility here, here. Improve access and ensure that patients are supported before their condition deteriorates. We could avoid, thus, to generate a cascade of other problems that cost even more to the health network. In addition, many other professionals are remunerated during their last year of training, such as doctors, pharmacists, etc. This is a concrete solution that would have an immediate effect for patients, "added the spokesperson. 
"The choices made by the minister are indecent: he invests billions for doctors, but nothing for patients with a mental health problem or for future psychologists who Quebecers need so much", has concluded Diane Lamarre.
