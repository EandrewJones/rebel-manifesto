Quebec- The member for Drummond and sentence of the official language opposition, Yves-François Blanchet, denounces the Camouflage operation of the Minister responsible for the application of the Charter of the French language, Christine St-Pierre , regarding studies on the language of display and trade in Montreal. 
The newspaper The press reveals this morning that these studies are ready and must be made public next month. "For weeks, Minister St-Pierre claims that the studies were not completed. However, they were sufficiently enough for a crisis management mandate to a close minister, Luc Ouellet, from the national public relations firm six months ago. It smells of Operation Camouflage in full nose, "denounced Yves-François Blanchet. 
For the Parti Québécois, there is an ethical problem because studies are currently accessible to a lobbyist close to Jean Charest before parliamentarians. "The contempt of Jean Charest towards our democratic institutions is no longer to demonstrate. In the present case, two things one: or the minister St-Pierre has no idea what is happening in his organization because for her and his government the protection of the language is commonplace, Or we seek to control the damage because the government fears that its negligence is highlighted, "continued the member. 
The spokesman for the Parti Québécois therefore requires that these studies, who have been in the hands of the OQLF for weeks, perhaps months, be made public. "The St-Pierre minister can no longer claim that the studies do not exist. Christine St-Pierre must answer the National Assembly of Quebec, not to Friends of Jean Charest, "concluded Yves-François Blanchet.
