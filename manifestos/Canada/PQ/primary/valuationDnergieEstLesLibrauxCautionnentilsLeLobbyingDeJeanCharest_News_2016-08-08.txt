Québec- The member for Sanguinet and spokesman for the Parti Energy and Natural Resources Party, Alain Therrien, as well as the member for Verchères and spokespersons for Quebec-Canada relations, Stéphane Bergeron, question The credibility of the National Energy Board (NEB) when it comes to evaluating the energy project is. 
"We learned that the NEB hid out information about a meeting held between his president and Jean Charest, while he was lobbyist for TransCanada. This secret meeting confirms, once again, that Quebec must not leave a federal agency decide in its place. This pipeline project is not commonplace; He would cross our territory, "said the hon. Member for Sanguinet. 
"The Liberals must tell the truth to Quebeckers: do they agree or not with energy? What do Philippe Couillard think and his ministers of lobbying at which Jean Charest is, their former leader? ", Also asked Alain Therrien. 
"It is to Quebeckers and Quebeckers to decide whether the pipeline project must see the day or not. Confide this important decision to a federal agency, which hides information, is a danger. And it is certainly not that we get the trust and support of a population, "concluded Stéphane Bergeron.
