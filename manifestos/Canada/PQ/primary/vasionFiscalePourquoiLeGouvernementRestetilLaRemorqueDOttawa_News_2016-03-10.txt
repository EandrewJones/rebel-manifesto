Quebec- While Quebec citizens are exempt from paying all of their taxes in Revenu Québec due to federal agreements, the Leader of the Official Opposition, Pierre Karl Péladeau, asked the Prime Minister to take its responsibilities for the tax laws of Quebec. 
"Tax evasion is a social and economic scourge. In recent years, 34 countries grouped within the OECD have begun the work to combat it. But there seems to be an exception: Canada. And Quebec is at the trailer of Ottawa. As a result, while the Liberal government of Philippe Couillard imposes tax increases with families and increases the tax of SMEs, one learns that twenty KPMG customers, who have hidden money on the island of Man. , will be able to get out of it, "said Pierre Karl Péladeau. 
"Yesterday, the Minister of Finance has confirmed that because of the Government of Quebec to the federal government, $ 130 million spent under the tax nose will be the subject of a tax amnesty for the firm. KPMG and its customers, despite that Revenu Québec refused to spend the sponge. Will Quebecers really pay for federal decisions that legitimize tax abuses orchestrated by KPMG? "Insisted the leader of the official opposition. 
"The Prime Minister was open to the idea of managing and collecting Quebec taxes by the federal government. We see this morning why it would be a serious mistake. The Prime Minister must commit to never entrusting the administration and perception of our taxes in Ottawa, "concluded Pierre Karl Péladeau.
