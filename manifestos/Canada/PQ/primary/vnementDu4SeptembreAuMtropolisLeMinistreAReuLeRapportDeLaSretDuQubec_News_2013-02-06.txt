Quebec- The Minister of Public Safety, Stéphane Bergeron, has received the Administrative Survey of Quebec Safety Investigation Report (SQ) Executive Report on the Electoral Party of the Parti Québécois in Metropolis, following the events that occurred at Metropolis In the general elections of September 4th. 
The dramatic events occurred at the metropolis, killing and injuring another, have raised many questions about the safety of public personalities, and demonstrate that Quebec is not immune to an attack. "I took note of the findings of the report and I received the formal insurance of the Director General of the Quebec Security that all the necessary operational adjustments were put in place, to deal with any new threat," said Mr. Bergeron. 
In order not to unveil the security methods taken by law enforcement, and because of the ongoing judicial proceedings, the content of the Quebec Security Report will not be made public. In addition, no additional comments from the minister will be made in this case. 
Recall that the day after the Metropolis incident, the SQ launched an administrative investigation into the security measures that have been put in place. As is always the case in such a situation, the Coroner's Office also conducts an investigation that will identify the causes and circumstances of the death of Mr. Denis Blanchette, a stage technician who worked during the event.
