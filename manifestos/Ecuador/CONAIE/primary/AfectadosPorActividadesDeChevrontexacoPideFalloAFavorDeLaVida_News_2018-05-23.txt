The nationalities of Sucumbíos, northern the Amazon, attended the audience that developed in the Constitutional Court in the city of Quito, demanding a failure in favor of life in the case Chevron Texaco that has been 25 years old fighting. 
Texaco procurablers asked the court judges so that the audience is suspended, said request was denied after sustaining that the procedure is done under legal standards covered in the Constitution. 
Jaime Vargas, president of the Conaie, and Marlon Vargas, president of Confénia, attended the audience in support of the affected peoples and nationalities waiting for a favorable resolution before the flagrant violation of human and environmental rights committed during all these years by Chevron Texaco. 
The Texaco case is one of the most controversial over environmental pollution by excessive oil spills and chemical residues, which has transformed the life of the Ecuadorian Amazon and its population. 
This case has transcended at an international level despite all attempts to delagitimize the demand of affected populations of succumbings. 
Siona, Cofanes, Waoranis, Siekopay Colonos and Kichwas have been fighting within a judicial process against the US oil in which they ask for absolute remediation of the damage caused by the oil tanker - Texaco. 
The crude spill left sequels like: three times greater the possibility of contracting diseases such as cancer than in other areas where there is no contamination; Sex violations by workers towards Amazonian women; intentional pollution of rivers and erster; 147% more abortions than in other areas; Death rates for malformations, leukemia, cancer and malnutrition, due to contact with crude toxins, among other conditions are urgent. 
Despite all the damages caused by Ecuadorian territory and especially of peoples and nationalities, in 2015 the Court of Appeals of the Circuit of the District of Columbia issues a judgment, after winning a trial for refusal of justice, where it obliges the Ecuadorian State to indemnify with USD 96 million dollars to the US oil.
