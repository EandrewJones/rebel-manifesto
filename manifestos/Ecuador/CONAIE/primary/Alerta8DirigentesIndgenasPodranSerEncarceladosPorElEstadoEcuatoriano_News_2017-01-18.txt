The indigenous survey and national unemployment raised in August 2015 not only left more than 100 criminalized human rights defenders, but was the starting point for the persecution of the leaders of the highest indigenous organizations of Ecuador. 
This is the case of the eight indigenous leaders of the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples and Nationalities of Ecuador Conaie and its subsidiaries Conf√©nia, NAE and FICSH. 
These leaders are charged by the Attorney General of the State for attack offenses or resistance art. 
283, PARALIZATION OF PUBLIC SERVICES ART. 
346, incitement to discord between citizens art. 
348 of the Integral Criminal Code. 
For these crimes, the eight leaders could receive a sanction of liberty from one to three years in prison, which would cause indigenous organizations to remain without their legitimately elected representatives and that represent vos of grassroots communities and indigenous organizations at the national, regional level and provincial.
