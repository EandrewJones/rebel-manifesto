Since the early hours of the morning of Thursday, January 21, the entrance of hundreds of police officers and militates be announced to Canton Taisha with the aim of seizing the machinery of the Provincial Government of Morona Santiago that builds the Via Macuma Taisha. 
The reaction of the Shuar people, Achuar and Mestizo did not wait. 
Moments of tension between people, police and military were lived before the incomprehensible given order that would slow down the advance of a path that is in its last kilometers of construction, longing for the town of Taisha for more than 50 years. 
While from the official networks, the true interests are trigunated after this untimely government decision, the Shuar Federations and Achuar subsidiaries of the Regional Organizations Conf√©da and National Conaie reject this new act of provocation by the Government, only responsible for the facts that could be presented . 
Again it is demonstrated that violence is generated by the State by militarizing our territories.
