Press release  Quito, December 9, 2015  The Communities and Communities of Quito We have been gathering since 2014 to analyze our situation before the permanent threats from political and economic interests that conceive land and territory as simple merchandise. 
Thus, infrastructure works such as the Viva Route, the new airport of Quito, the VLO-35 and other real estate projects have caused fractionation of the communal territory, internal division, disrespected to our communal authorities, to our right to self-determination and full exercise of collective rights. 
The communes have held meetings with the Mayor's office to open dialogue spaces with a political agenda that includes among other points: analyze issues of territory, community governments, collective rights, ordinances, among others. 
Unfortunately, we observe lack of political will on the part of some officials to understand what the construction of a true multi-national and intercultural state means as a state transformation project and society. 
We note that these terms of plurinationality and interculturality are used as empty words, romantic and folkloric conceptions that reaffirm conditions of inequality and colonial attitudes are maintained in the form of relationship with us communes and communities. 
With this antecedent and commemoration of December 10, International Day of Human Rights, Communes and Communities We recall the country and the city of Quito, which one of the principles of this statement indicates that "all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. 
. 
,” (Art. 
1) and that "... all have the right to equal protection against all discrimination. 
. 
” (Art. 
7). 
For this reason, the communes and communities are self-summoned this Thursday, December 10 at 9:00 to deliver the mayor of Quito, Mauricio Rodas, the proposal of the Comunas and Communities of Kitu-Millennium.
