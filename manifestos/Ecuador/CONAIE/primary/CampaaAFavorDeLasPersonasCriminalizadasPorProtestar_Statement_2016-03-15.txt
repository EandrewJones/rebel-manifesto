Quito, March 15, 2016  "Resisting is my right," it is a national campaign that seeks to visibilize criminalized people by protesting in Ecuador during the national lifting last August of 2015. 
More than 100 people were judicialized by crimes such as: sabotage, attack and resistance, public service paralysis. 
Several people have already been sanctioned and sentenced with prison and great fines, others could be sanctioned and go to jail of 6 months to 7 years in prison. 
The campaign synthesizes judicial cases and testimonies of criminalized people in: Loja-Saraguro, Pichincha, Ca√±ar, Pastaza, Morona Santiago, Zamora Chinchipe, Orellana, Tungurahua-Amber, Imbabura, Cotopaxi. 
The campaign "Resist is my right" was presented through a press conference at Headquarters La Conaie (Northern Quito, capital of Ecuador) today March 15, 2016. 
Jorge Herrera, president of CONAIE, pointed out during the national uprising "We seek that rights being fulfilled." 
Therefore, despite the criminalization of human rights defenders will continue on the streets, he said. 
In addition, it indicated that they will return to the National Assembly an Amnesty Law (was already presented in 2013) for human rights defenders. 
"Resisting is my right" demonstrates that in Ecuador the criminalization policy is rather directed against indigenous, workers, students, women, advocates and human rights defenders and nature. 
All this despite the Constitution of Ecuador recognize the right to resistance in article 98. 
At Loja, from March 21 to April 8, the appeal audiences will be given to trial against 10 people and 19 are waiting for the audience.
