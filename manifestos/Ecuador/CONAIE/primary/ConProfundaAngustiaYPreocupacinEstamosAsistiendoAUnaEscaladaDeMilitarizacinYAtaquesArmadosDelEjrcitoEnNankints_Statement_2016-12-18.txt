Press release  D. 
M. 
Quito, December 17, 2016  Of different sources we have corroborated the entry of military in a broad territorial spectrum around San Juan Bosco. 
Shuar commuvers testimonies in the place speak of 30 military trucks and two helicopters, and harassment with gusts of rifle on the Nankints site, which has forced evacuating women and children terrified to the jungle. 
He has also initiated a witch hunt with arbitrary raids and arbitrary arrests of San Carlos Panantza and other people, without mediating any explanation, while military and police continue to arrive at San Juan Bosco, taking the streets with patrols in armored vehicles . 
It is a state of terror. 
The violence statements by the President of the Republic at Liaison 505 ratify that the State's option is for violence. 
The racism poured by Correa shows that behind his left speech he is an elitist who believes the indigenous people who need tutelage, which although it is enjoyed an ancestral using our ponchos and our Tawasas, they are willing to devast our people to Give the Chinese way. 
We fear the address they have assumed lead to a massacre between Ecuadorians, and it is absolute priority of Conaie avoid this. 
We ratify our order to church and international organizations mediation for a dialogue exit without deepening and aggravating the existing conflict.
