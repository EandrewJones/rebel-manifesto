Pronouncement to the nankints case  The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities and Peoples of the Ecuadorian Coast Conaice, before the different events generated in the province of Morona Santiago, sensitive to all social and cultural affectations towards citizens in general in a special way to children, women and people of the third age, without distinction of age, sex or cultural or ethnic belonging, we solidarize ourselves and join the pain that dozens of people affected by such events are, we call through the next analysis to contribute to the current situation and do not continue to be deepened Wounds between actors and sectors of the same country, and achieve social and community harmony and the Sumak Kawsay that we both preach. 
Currently there is a marked gap in the implementation of international standards willing on the rights of indigenous peoples, the national levels and the exercise or practice of such policies, although in our country the ratification and adoption of Legal instruments and the existence of basic institutional mechanisms that are considered necessary to facilitate the realization of a human right, is not efficiently assumed by citizenship by many factors, but it is important to measure the commitment or intention of the State of adopting publications and public policies To make a right effective. 
At the beginning of any project that may directly or indirectly affect indigenous communities, it is the obligation of the State to carry out studies of social and cultural impacts and, studies of environmental impacts prior to the realization of the processes with active participation of the Community (indigenous or not indigenous), in conditions of freedom, prior knowledge and assessing times and spaces between the actors and respecting the culture of the community and the general interest of the State. 
Added to this, we must fulfill and assume a very important element, which is the legitimacy of Community representatives (indigenous or non-indigenous), who participate in all stages of the process, for this, it is very important that these representatives have been chosen by the Communities according to their traditional practices and their own government systems and that the State assumes the legitimacy of indigenous representatives, since the indigenous representatives that sit down to dialogue still having the legality of the case are not legitimately recognized by their bases ; Converting the process into a space of political enhancement or in the worst case, the dialogue in a negotiation space with non-collective interests. 
Finally, the attitude of all third parties participating in all the processes of law of indigenous nationalities and peoples, whether throughout the State or through the indigenous community to ensure that they also respect the need for sincerity and Transparency in dialogue, and are not enthusiasts that only cause and incite an unseenable discussion or proposals. 
We call on the unit, to the Brotherhood, to the solidarity of all the actors involved in the case of the Nankints community, emphately rejecting violence and repression and auguring that the dialogue is the most appropriate mechanism to overcome this impasse , for which the legitimate representatives of this community are presented to a sincere and fraternal dialogue and the State guarantees the exercise of the rights that correspond to them, taking into account that life should be prioritized over any other material. 
The nationalities and indigenous peoples of the Ecuadorian coast  .
