Quito, August 02, 2017  The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador-CONAIE made the delivery of the mandate with 4 programmatic axes on July 4, 2017 before the Government of Lenin Moreno. 
That same day we receive favorable responses such as the restitution of bilingual intercultural education, opening of the Intercultural University, community transport, and others. 
Similarly, Lenín Moreno pointed out that we must maintain work meetings, and we have taken the floor, so the dialogue will be the national government and the Conaie. 
In coming days we hope to have a date and time of the appointment with the Government to expose the methodology, meanwhile the CONAIE conformed 4 commissions in which they make up experience on the subject to dealing, who have the proposals ready in a detailed way for the appointment With President Lenín Moreno. 
We call on our bases of the three regions of Ecuador strengthen unity and not fall into despair, work articulated and organized. 
And to government bodies we demand coordination to respect the organizational structure of the CONAIE taking into account that there is intention of some personalities of the Government that aim to truncate the process of dialogue initiated by the current President of the Republic of Ecuador.
