M. 
Quito, September 28, 2016  The headquarters of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon, Conféniae, Regional de la Conaie, located in Base Union, Puyo City, Province of Pastaza, today dawned invaded by hundreds of uniformed from the National Police of Ecuador, who act under Orders of government officials, specifically from the National Secretariat of Policy Management that aim to weaken and divide the organization. 
It is important to note that the conference since September 21 is in Minka, collective work, at its headquarters. 
While groups related to the government are mobilized in buses of the Vice Presidency of Ecuador to provoke possible clashes. 
Under the pretext of the application of Decree 016, now 739, and its different policies of repression, criminalization, persecution, the Government of Rafael Correa during his stay in power has tried to fraction the indigenous movement, but he can not get his purpose and not you'll make it. 
Therefore, as Conaie:  We categorically reject this new attempt to abuse of power by the government of Country Alliance and its entire structure. 
We call a call between towns and nationalities in the Amazon, and not fall into the Government's game of Rafael Correa. 
We take responsibility for the Portfolio of National Secretariat for Management of Policy, the National Government of Ecuador before any act of violence, confrontation or human loss that may exist for this type of irresponsibles.
