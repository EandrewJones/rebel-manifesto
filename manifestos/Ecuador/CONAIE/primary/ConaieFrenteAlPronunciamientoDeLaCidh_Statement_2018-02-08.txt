Quito, February 8, 2018  The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, based in the city of San José de Costa Rica, today denied the request for provisional measures carried out by the Inter-American Human Law Commission (IACHR) against Ecuador, to protect the Directors Edwin Jarrín, Tania Pauker And Sonia Vera. 
The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador-CONAIE salutes the decision made by the Court, as it respects the decision expressed democratically on February 4, 2018 in the popular consultation, in which the people decided by the YES to the renewal of the Citizen participation council and social control. 
With the same emphasis we emphasize that we are on the expectation that the results of the questions raised as a resounding to set limits on mining and oil exploitation in ITT become public policy with speed as well as the fight against corruption and the protection of children against sexual abuse.
