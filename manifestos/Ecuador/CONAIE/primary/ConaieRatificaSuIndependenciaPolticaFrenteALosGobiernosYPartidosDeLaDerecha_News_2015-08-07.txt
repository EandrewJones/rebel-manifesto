Quito, August 6, 2015  The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador Conaie, at the conjuncture of the popular manifestations initiated with the March of Tundayme on August 2, before the attempts of the right parties to take advantage of the political moment that lives the Ecuador and the mobilizations of the indigenous movement , Workers and other social sectors, express:  The indigenous movement recognizes as unique historical allies to all sectors from the popular classes: workers, students, teachers and other guilds that make up the great popular social basis of Ecuador with which we have starred, maintaining firm the unit of the field and The city versus the interests of shift governments, right political parties, national and transnational companies, bankers and others by dividing the homeland. 
On the other hand, the dominant classes from right-wing matches and from reformist left, have always tried to use social organizations as a staircase and political platform to maintain their domain and hegemony. 
Such a fact has been evident with the fall of different governments, after which they always have politically harvested the achievements of social struggle. 
Faced with this verification proven in the last and present history, as CONAIE we ratified our political independence against the current government and right-wing political parties, which together with country alliance - the new right disguised as socialism - they struggle to distribute political and economic power in Detribution of the interests of the vast majority of the Ecuadorian people. 
While in these moments the great march of the people, political leaders of the right express publicly and call on social networks to a supposed solidarity with the mobilizations, with the firm intention to use this juncture for their own benefits, confusing To citizenship and delegitimizing our legitimate mobilization. 
Before this, we ratify that our only commitment is: with the popular sectors, with the exploited of the field and the city, with the poor, with whom we remain firm preparing the survey and national unemployment. 
We summoned our bases and all the social sectors to join this great day by the defense of democracy, the dignity of peoples and the fulfillment of our struggle platform that faithfully expresses the demands of the Ecuadorian people for respect for the rights of The towns and nationalities, workers, students and the people.
