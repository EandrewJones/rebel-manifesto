In the territories of the Shuar nationality and peasant sibles of the San Marcos sector of the Parish Tundayme, Canton Pangui, Province of Zamora Chinchipe, on September 30, 2015, members of the National Police, Military and Private Security of Ecuacoriente mining company S. 
A. 
They evicted 13 indigenous and peasant families violently without any prior notification, invading community territories. 
The CONAIE strongly rejects this act that with clarity in sample of violation of human rights, collective rights, the self-determination of peoples, prior consultation and other rights on consecrated and guaranteed peoples and nationalities in the Constitution of the Republic, the Treaties International as the ILO and the United Nations Declaration. 
However, President Rafael Correa during his intervention in the seventh (70 Â°) General Assembly of the UN focused on highlighting the importance of environmental protection. 
But, that in reality with those discourses demonstrates the double side of the Ecuadorian government, when in reality with the extractivist (oil and mining) policies of the government causes environmental disasters and runlings to human rights. 
In addition, it is clear that Ecuacoriente S. 
A. 
It causes environmental deterioration in Tundayme. 
For all this, the CONAIE directly accounts for the Ecuadorian State and the central government for the violent acts with it acts against indigenous and peasants in the ancestral territories, which as a consequence causes psychological, physical, social, cultural damage to men , Women, boys, girls from the San Marcos area. 
We demand the immediate withdrawal of transnational mining companies and their machinery with which they are evicting our comuneros. 
We welert and denounce the instances of human rights at the national and international level.
