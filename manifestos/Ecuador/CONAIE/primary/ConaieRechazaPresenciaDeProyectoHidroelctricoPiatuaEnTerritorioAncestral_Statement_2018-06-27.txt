In the ancestral territory, this did so after an assembly performed on June 26, 2018 after alert on the presence of such hydroelectric plant. 
From the Conaie we reject the presence of this hydroelectric project in the ancestral territory of Amazonian nationality. 
In the same way, we urge the national government to ensure the granting of hydroelectric projects, miners, oil tankers and all forms of extractive activity because it affects the integrity of the lives of peoples and nationalities. 
We call the Government of Turno to stop criminalizing and persecuting the defenders of the ancestral territories, water sources, collective rights, rights of nature and human rights. 
We ratify our firm position in the struggle for the defense of our ancestral territories against all forms of destruction. 
Social struggle is the path traced to defend our rights, territories. 
It is now more than ever to strengthen the unity of peoples, nationalities, oppressed and exploited sector of the countryside and the city.
