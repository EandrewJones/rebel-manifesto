Quito, January 16, 2018  Pepe Acacho and Pedro Mashiant were sentenced on Monday, January 15, 2018, by a criminal court of the National Court of Justice for the alleged crime of paralysis of public services. 
Acaco and Mashiant initially were accused of the alleged crime of sabotage and terrorism. 
Since the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, we strongly reject this act of injustice that fell against our fellow social fighters, who have as the only crime to defend the rights of peoples and nationalities. 
It is unprecedented that in this time of "dialogue" the persecution of social fighters continues. 
We call our bases to remain vigilant before any act of injustice, above all, press and continue with the struggle process to get the amnesty in favor of fellow fighters. 
In the same way, we call on the unit of all and all to concrete results to our real demands of communes, communities, peoples and nationalities in this "dialogue" process.
