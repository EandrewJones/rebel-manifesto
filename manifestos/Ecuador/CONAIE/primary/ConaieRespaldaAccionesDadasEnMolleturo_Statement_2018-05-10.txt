Press release  Basin, May 10, 2018  The town of Molleturo made the night of May 8, 2018, actions in fact as a pronouncement of the disagreement to the presence and operations of the company Junefield / EcuadorGoldmin South America S A. 
, in the Páramos del Boxes (Basin), Río Blanco community. 
From the CONAIE we support the action taken by the comuneros and commons of Molleturo - Rio Blanco, as a sign of dissatisfaction with the lack of seriousness and concrete results within the dialogue process around extractive issues, in which we find several social organizations. 
We consider that the word given by the President of the Republic of "No More Mining Concessions" is in question when in reality, local populations continue to suffer the lying of mining in their territories. 
This is why the actions that from territory are promoted are legitimate and have the support of CONAIE and its structure. 
We solidated with the partner Yaku Pérez Guarkambel, president of ECUARUNARI, a subsidiary Conaie, with Mario Fherz and Víctor Hernández, leaders of the FOA, by the kidnapping and death threat received by the company Junefield / EcuadorGoldmin South America S A. 
, against his physical and psychological integrity. 
We exhort the national government at the cessation of persecution and repression against social fighters, defenders of nature. 
We take responsibility for the Mining company Junefield / EcuadorGoldmining South America S A. 
, by the possible attacks against the life of the community and communerals of Molleturo and Rio Blanco in the province of Azuay  Social struggle is the path traced to defend our rights, territories. 
It is now more than ever to strengthen the unity of peoples, nationalities, oppressed and exploited sector of the countryside and the city.
