Press release  Machachi, August 11, 2015  Conaie regrets the accident happened yesterday, August 10, at night, August 10, where the companion Martha Medina died because of a running, and the companion Celia Guayllas resulted in minor wounds. 
The fact was arreded in the sector of entry to Lasso, after the March had already been withdrawn from the Pan-American Way, and out of context. 
The companions were about to return to Zamora to participate in the actions of August 13 in their province, and the accident occurred at the time they crossed the way to catch a bus. 
We reject the intentionality of the evidenced government in the declarations of the Deputy Security Security in your Twitter account, to use the political tragedy, insinuating neglect on the part of the leadership. 
Lost as these are irreparable for the CONAIE, because it was fellow fighters who have not only argued this march from Tundayme, but in their organizational processes in the territories that they defend honoring the courage and the willingness of the partners we continue advancing in the uprising towards the National unemployment until the objectives for which she walked are achieved. 
We expect a prompt research on the incident by the competent authorities.
