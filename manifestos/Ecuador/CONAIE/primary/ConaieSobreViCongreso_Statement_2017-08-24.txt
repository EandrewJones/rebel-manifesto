Quito, August 24, 2017  The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador-Conae- exposes to public opinion, bases, and citizenship in general that the economic crisis through which the country is going through, it affects all and all, which will not be carried out by the VI Congress of the Conaie on the dates established on June 10 in Base Union, Puyo, Pastaza. 
The current Governing Council works hard by the articulation, coordination and unity of the people and nationalities of Ecuador. 
We make progress thinking about the welfare of the community, but not in personal interests-private interests. 
It is our longing that the VI congress of the Conaie is made in the most dignified, haughty and combative way in unity among all the peoples and nationalities that constitute the structure of the indigenous movement. 
Therefore, we make public that the VI Congress will be held on September 14, 15 and 16, 2017 in the province of Zamora Chinchipe, Canton Zamora, Colosseum of the Sports Federation of the city. 
This great event will be given by the unity and dignity of the indigenous peoples of Ecuador in the search for a real transformation of social structures and for the construction of the plurinational state.
