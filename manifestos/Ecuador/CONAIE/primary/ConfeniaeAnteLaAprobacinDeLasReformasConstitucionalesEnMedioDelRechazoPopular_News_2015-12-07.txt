Public pronouncement
The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon confented, before the approval of constitutional reforms this December 3, 2015, in the National Assembly in the midst of popular rejection and before the repressive action of the Ecuadorian Government and the Public Force, expresses the National and international public opinion:
While conniade fulfills a positioning work I have an incidence participating actively from COP21 in Paris, France, just as some delegations of the Amazonian nationalities in Ecuador, we have witnessed the unconstitutional actions with which the National Assembly approved the so-called reforms to the Constitution, hand in hand with the police repression against our bases in the framework of the protests that these facts generated throughout the country, mainly in cities such as Quito, Guayaquil, Cuenca, and Provinces such as Tungurahua, Imbabura, Santo Domingo, Orellana, Pasta , Zamora. 
Faced with these reforms that support the very nature of the State, approved by a group of legislators who do not know the popular will that demands the call to a national consultation for issues of national interest that compromise the future of all Ecuadorians, we emphasize once again our Firm called to continue and strengthen the popular struggle throughout Ecuador, given that the approval of the amendments occurs in the midst of a clear rejection of social organizations and the Ecuadorian people. 
Beyond the image that the Government tries to project and the media fence with which it aims to hide reality, such reforms will not be accepted by this firm and combative people, because they lack legitimacy and popular approval. 
We reject the repression exercised against our people who until now leaves the balance of 50 detainees and 10 wounded in the city of Quito, 4 in Santo Domingo and 4 in Orellana, including indigenous and union leaders. 
As part of our international delegation in Paris within the framework of the Conference of the Parties COP21, on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, we raise our firm voice of protest before the whole world and, within the framework of the agenda and proposals Since the vision of the villages holders of forests, we realize the international public opinion that in Ecuador are trampling rights, reprimanding the people, evicting and displacing communities, criminalizing social leaders and attempting against the main life infrastructure of the towns and nationalities, that is, the Biodive Territories of the Coast, Sierra and Amazon through Mega Extractive Petroleum Projects, with the tenth Round Oil and Open Sky Mining in Tundayme and Nankintsa Sector Cordillera de Cóndor, one of The most rich and fragile ecosystem places in the world, for the benefit of mining and oil transnational companies. 
Such facts constitute a flagrant contradiction with the speech of Rafael Correa who is prized of having one of the most advanced constitutions in the world in environmental matters, while on the other hand, militarizes the Cordillera del Cóndor and divides the organizations and Amazonian indigenous peoples to facilitate The entrance of the oil companies to our territories, displacing and evicting indigenous and peasant families. 
This is an attack against human rights as the peoples and nationalities that in no way accept and before which we will never kneel, because we are rebellious peoples. 
President Rafael Correa at COP 21 preparing to create the Court of Climate Justice before which we point out that it is inconsistent because so that there is a climate justice, extractive activity in Ecuador in indigenous territories should be decreased as sincere exhibition and firm political will, of The opposite who must appear before said court would be his own government. 
We also reject the hypocritical attitude of Rafael Correa, because at the international level I want to position the image of its Government as an environmental government, and proclaims and asks for economic resources for the forests in the Amazon. 
Well, we clarify that 90% of the forests that remain in Ecuador are in indigenous territories and these have been preserved thanks to the constant struggle of indigenous peoples and not by public policies of the State. 
Therefore, the resources coming from initiatives for mitigation, adaptation and resilience against climate change, such as those of green climate background must be used directly to indigenous organizations and peoples. 
Conféniae continues to firm with her fighting agenda despite any division attempt by the Government and its institutions. 
This is how we support Sarayaku's Kichwa people's life proposals that is the living jungle - Kawsak Sacha, Holistic Management of Kutukú Shaimi (RIA) of the Shuar People proposals not only for our peoples and territories, but true alternatives for survival and well-being From the planet Earth, afflicted by the voracious interests of multinational companies. 
Although the capitalist countries and their surrender governments intend to close the last rich territories in Mega Diversity, the nationalities tell the world that we will continue to be the guarantors of life and the guardians of their continuity as we have done since the time immemorial. 
Actually,  Franco Viteri Gualinga  President de Confeniae  .
