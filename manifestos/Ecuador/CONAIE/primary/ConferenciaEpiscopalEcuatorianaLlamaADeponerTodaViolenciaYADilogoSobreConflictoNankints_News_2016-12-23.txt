The Ecuadorian Episcopal Conference issued a press release on December 22 in the city of Quito, making a call to depose violence and seek an exit dialogue to the existing conflict in Nankints by the EXSA Chinese mining presence. 
In the section he points out that "Christmas is timely time to build peace and disarm the human heart of any violence." 
For this, they "strongly ask that, as Ecuadorians, members of the same family, we deprive all violence and start dialogue against the lamentable events that occurred in the province of Morona Santiago." 
For his part, the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, Conaie, rejects the arrest of Agustín Wachapá, president of the Interprovincial Federation of Centro Shuar-FICSH, because it was "arbitrary. 
In addition, they indicate that this act (detention) all it does is deepen the crisis in Morona Santiago. 
The indigenous organization of Ecuador see international mediation for an output to the conflict, because, to say of the organization, with the "prepotent and racist character with which Rafael Correa acts" no outputs are enabled to the problem, but to deepen it. 
The statement from the Episcopal Conference is signed by the General Secretariat.
