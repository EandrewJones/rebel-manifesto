BULLETIN  Last Monday, May 23, 2016, the court of criminal guarantees of Loja decided to call 12 of the 19 processes of the Saraguro case to whom a criminal process was initiated for participating in the August 2015 indigenous uprising. 
The other 7 processed were dismissed due to lack of probative elements for prosecution. 
The 12 comrades of the Saraguro people have been called to trial for the alleged crime of paralysis of public services, which according to the Organic Criminal Integral Code may have a penalty of Liberty of 1 to 3 years. 
In the afternoon, on Monday, dozens of people from the communities of Saraguro focused on the central square to take a walk to the court where they received the resolution. 
The 12 colleagues are added to another 10 that, between this Tuesday, 24 and Wednesday, May 25 will receive the sentence for the same presumed crime. 
In total in Saraguro during the protests of the survey and the national unemployment in August 2015, 31 people were processed. 
Two women were dismissed and 29 continue with the criminal proceedings against him. 
There are currently 22 processed calls for paralysis of public services in Saraguro, located in southern Ecuador. 
At the national level 123 people have been criminalized in Ecuador for demanding their rights and those of nature. 
From the CONAIE we reject this new attempt to silence the voices of the peoples that we demand our rights, that our intercultural education, community schools, our indigenous justice and our territories are respected. 
This will not stop us, the people of Saraguro ratifies that it will strengthen the resistance even if the State uses justice to stop.
