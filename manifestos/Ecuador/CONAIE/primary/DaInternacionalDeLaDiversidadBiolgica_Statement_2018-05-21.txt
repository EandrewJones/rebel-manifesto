Quito, May 21, 2018  On May 22, 25 years ago of the International Day Declaration of Biological Diversity under the Convention that was issued by the UN on the protection of the millions of natural species that exist on our planet. 
This Agreement reaffirms the universal and common interest for the human being that represents the natural conservation of biological diversities worldwide. 
For the peoples and nationalities of Ecuadorian territory, the progress of mining projects in sensitive areas, seriously concerns especially the indigenous population that are the ones who live, where large-scale interventions are currently carried out. 
Although the indigenous communities that inhabit the area reformly refreshly to the intervention in its territory of extractive projects that alter their forms of life and ecosystems, the Ecuadorian Government has ignored this order, causing chaos within the communities and in the environment. 
The pollution that are generating mining activities not only attempt against the lives of originating communities, but mainly to the great diversity of native flora and fauna of the moors and the Ecuadorian forest that are directly contaminated. 
From CONAIE, we commemorate the International Day of Biological Diversity with acts of resistance and alternative proposals to extractivism from the daily life. 
We call on the governments of duty and society in general to fight for the remaining conservation of diverse spaces and territories, water sources as the only option for the continuity of human, animal and plant life.
