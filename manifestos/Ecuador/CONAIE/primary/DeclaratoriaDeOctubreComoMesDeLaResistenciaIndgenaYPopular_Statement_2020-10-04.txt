, Quito, October 4, 2020  The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, CONAIE, at the end of the first anniversary of the Popular Indigenous Removal and National Town of October 2019, in commemoration to all social fighters, the victims of state violence between wounded, mutilated and family of deceased, He declares to October as "month of indigenous and popular resistance", at the same time to ratify our commitment to the requirement of truth, justice and repair. 
We remember how the indigenous movement and the Ecuadorian people as a whole were mobilized in a single fist, we would tremble with power, we clearly guide the agenda of resistance and demands to face the laws and decrees that affected Ecuadorian society, measures as the decree 883 that the conditions of life and existence of the most vulnerable popular sectors of the country, however, the Government of Lenín Moreno, vilely exploded the pandemic, deepened the crisis, through economic policies, approval of laws and decrees that channeled The IMF impositions, alliances to govern with business and financial sectors, as well as, protection to corrupt and tax evaders, created a pandemic of corruption, overprices and neoliberal adjustments. 
Since March, while in the communes, communities, towns, nationalities and neighborhoods, before the abandonment of the State, we face the pandemic since solidarity, the Government and the National Assembly, at the pretext of confinement and the health emergency, they gave accurate blows to the budget of health, education and pocket of the working class and peasants, drowned social instability, promoting privatizations, precarization, labor flexibility, unemployment, massive layoffs, labor exploitation and dispossession of our resources and territories; The Government of Moreno and its ministers are responsible for this multidimensional crisis, only in recent months, the approval of the so-called humanitarian support law and the Law on Public Finance, Antipopular and Antipobreras, demonstrate the incapacity and indolence of the Government. 
Since the previous year, the indigenous movement and more than 500 organizations at the national level present proposals resulting from dialogue and collective participation, so in July 2020 since the Parliament of the Peoples was presented the proposal named by life with real alternatives to face The crisis, but, the government again ignored, that is why we have to ratify the unity of the indigenous and popular sectors, putting up a struggle platform with an enormous awareness about the demands and the need for permanent mobilization to demand Respect for our violated rights. 
The economic measures that motivated October 2019, regarding Decree 883, are still valid and become acute, in July 2020, the Government eliminated the subsidy to the fuels with the price band system for extra, ecopais and diesel gasoline. 
Decree 1158, signed this September 25, releases the import of fuels by benefiting the monopolies of the hydrocarbon business and privatizing this strategic sector, without representing contribution to public finances, these actions executed by René Ortiz, Minister of Energy and Resources , and Richard Martínez, Minister of Economy, demonstrate how the national government deceived the country by not fulfilling the demands and raised at the televised dialogue of last year. 
For all this background we insist on rejection of economic measures that affect the Ecuadorian people, if the Government maintains this foolish sectors organized will continue in permanent resistance as a historical transformation weapon, mobilized, now there are more affected sectors, indignation and social discomfort, now. For all the deepening of the crisis, if there is another October it will be stronger. 
The policy of violence, repression, prosecution and criminalization with which the Government of Lenín Moreno and the abuse of authority will not be implemented and the abuse of Atroz, with direct responsibility of the Government Ministers, María Paula Romo; and Defense, Oswaldo Jarrín, by committing crimes of humanity against indigenous, peasants, workers, students, women, children and seniors. 
Our struggle goes beyond the electoral processes, the unity of the indigenous movement is ratified in the organizational processes of our structure and the bases organized to make collective decisions, the October 2019 unemployment is the fighting flag that belongs to Village, so we call to maintain the unity of the social sectors for the defense of our territories and rights, the CONAIE will continue in inclaudable resistance. 
In the framework of the first anniversary of October we will make several commemorative events, as well, on October 09 and 10 in the San Isidro community, Pujilí (Cotopaxi) will take place the commemorative event "October Rebel" Innocent Tucumbi, in 2 days of Solidarity, struggle and conscience by our mutilated companions and murdered by state violence. 
Together with the Association of Victims of the National Arrival "Innocence Tucumbi", on Monday, October 12, the tree, we will carry out a ceremony, concentration and peaceful mobilization towards the General Prosecutor's Office of the State, where we will present a lawsuit against the State for the Serious vulnerations to human rights Product of the brutal repression towards the people, in the requirement of truth, justice and repair. 
October Rebel is still present!  The fight goes because it goes!   By the Governing Council  Jaime Vargas.  President of the Conaie  .
