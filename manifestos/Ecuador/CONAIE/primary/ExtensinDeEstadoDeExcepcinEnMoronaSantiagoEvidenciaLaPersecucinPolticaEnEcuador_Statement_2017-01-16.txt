Quito, January 16, 2017  On January 12 through Decree 1294 issued by Rafael Correa, president of Ecuador, extended the state of exception in Morona Santiago for 30 days after the existing conflict in #nankints by the presence of the EXSA Chinese mining, camp Hope. 
The 30 days passed from the first exception state decree only served to: find 2 hunting shotguns; imprison Shuar and peasant leaders; militarize morona santiago; Vulnerating rights of indigenous peoples. 
For this reason, Decree 1294 is the sustenance to continue with political persecution against leaders. 
With the first state of exception, five people of pananza were imprisoned and sent to the maximum security jail located in Latacunga without prior proper procedure. 
The declaration of innocence made on January 13 for the five prisoners, evidence and ratifies the inconsistency and lack of independence in the administration of justice in Ecuador. 
Rafael Correa extends for 30 days the state of exception in Morona Santiago to fulfill its whim and the lack of humility with which it acts at the head of a country like Ecuador. 
Given this the Conaie and Confeniae provided a joint press conference next to the Shuar FICSH Federation, where the National Government Decision was rejected, emphasizing that no evidence against the Shuar people have been found. 
We emphasize that when militarizes and pursued leaders there is no plurinational state; The Government seeks to stop and silence the leaders, that's why it has expanded the state of exception, but this does not admit us. 
We call to intensify national and international solidarity with our Shuar brothers. 
By the Governing Council of Conaie  Jorge Herrera.  President Conaie.  By the Governing Council of Conféniae  Marlon Vargas.  Conféniae President  .
