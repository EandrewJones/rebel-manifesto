The results that brings the universal periodic review on the situation of human rights in Ecuador generates expectation in indigenous activists and leaders that last week traveled to Geneva to deliver their contributions. 
Among those who led the entourage was ELSIE MONGE, Vice President for Latin America of the International Human Rights Federation (FIDH) and Executive Director of the Ecumenical Commission on Human Rights (CEDhu). 
Before members of the United Nations Committee that analyzes this theme, Monge exposed alleged "serious violations" of these rights, "especially for the lack of compliance with the obligation to investigate and punish the facts with due diligence that occur in the country." 
He alluded to 20 cases of violations of the right to life and the personal integrity that follow in impunity, such as that of Jos√© Tendetza, human rights defender killed in 2014, and that of Francisco Cajigas, a victim of forced disappearance and extrajudicial execution. 
Meanwhile, Jorge Herrera, president of the Conaie, alerted diplomats from a supposed "persecution and judicialization to social fighters, violation of the right to prior consultation, violation of freedom of association". 
On several occasions, the regime has denied these accusations and has stated that its policy is of respect for human rights. 
He has also denied any type of criminalization. 
"Here are pursued crimes, not people," the president, Rafael Correa constantly declared.
