Luis Miranda, Judge of the Pastaza Court decided this afternoon to suspend without any argument the High Judgment Audience against 7 citizens, after 8 hours of hearing and after the attention of GEBERADACA local level where dozens of citizens carried out a vigil demanding justice. 
Jorge Herrera, president of the Conaie, questioned the judge's procedure who at the beginning of the day he declared the audience reserved and evicted the room. 
The decision to suspend the act is extremely questionable and evidence once again that there are political pressures against which there is no independence of justice, he said. 
"We will be present accompanying our colleagues who did not commit any crime, we demand the file file because the prosecution lacks evidence," he emphasized. 
The audience will continue on Wednesday, December 9 from 11:00 with the assistance of citizenship and the social organizations of Pastaza.
