The indigenous and peasant federation of Imbabura-fici- said today, Sunday, January 4, 2015, by Guayllabamba. 
The North Peoples advance to Quito with the purpose of defending collective and individual rights and also to ratify Conaie's house as property and heritage of the towns and nationalities of Ecuador. 
To others, they point out that it is not concern only the House of Conaie for the Peoples that make up the FICI, but also, the creation of the laws since the government without taking into account the demands of indigenous communities. 
Such as the water law, the Land Law that is in treatment in the Assembly and other public policies created from the current government. 
The police constantly monitor the walkers. 
At the passage through the toll guangaje the uniformed took pictures of those who walked. 
Under the glow of Tayta Inti walk women, young people, men with great joy with clear target. 
The support of the citizens feels for the applause at the passage of the walkers, the whistle of the cars, smiles and accompaniment in the screams of the slogans. 
From the Conaie, two leaders were added to this hike. 
Severino Sharupi, leader of territory and Rumy Yumbay, ruling of youth.
