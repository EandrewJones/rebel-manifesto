Quito, February 13, 2019  The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador - CONAIE has been a permanent actor in the process of reforms to the Communication Law and has insisted on its proposals for the defense of rights to communication and its access to and for peoples and nationalities, As, in the importance of community media for the exercise of collective rights, based on a free, intercultural, inclusive, diverse and participatory communication. 
The Loc Reforms, approved on Tuesday, December 18, 2018 already included last-moment changes in the final report, transferring to pressures promoted by the Economic Power Groups and Representatives of Communication Monopolies, affecting Community Media in detriment to the democratization of the radio spectrum  After this, the Community communication sector pretend to be harmed with partial objection (veto) sent by the president, Len√≠n Moreno, which eliminates affirmative actions that were already contemplated in the Organic Communication Law (LOC), approved in the 2013, such as: access to training; Tax exemptions to import equipment; Preferential credits, among others, which means recurrence in terms of rights. 
Its elimination from the presidential veto would greatly affect the creation and existence of community media, an important sector in a democratic society. 
In this regard, we call on the National Assembly so that, in the session on Thursday, February 14, 2019, where the debate will be developed to the veto of the Executive to the reforms to the Organic Communication Law (LOC) Vote article By article, Article 86 on affirmative actions for Community Media, and Article 98, which promotes national audiovisual production, since its elimination would be devastating for community communication and intercultural and independent production in Ecuador. 
That is, a not the veto of the president in these two articles. 
We recall that the Rapporteurship for Freedom of Expression of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, recognized as a favorable the inclusion of affirmative actions as a mechanism to strengthen the plurality and diversity of voices, when clarifying the measures that the State will implement in favor of the media Community
