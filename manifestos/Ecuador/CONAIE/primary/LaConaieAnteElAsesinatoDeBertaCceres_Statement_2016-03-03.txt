Indigenous woman, who fought for the territory, and who leaves us a legacy. 
Photo: Internet  We emit this press release, which is detailed below, with great outrage about what happened in Honduras with an indigenous companion of the territory. 
We filled with that pain, but at the same time of that courage to continue in this process in defense of rights, nature, life, of the territory. 
In our country we also have human losses for the same cause, defend our territory, as is the case of Bosco Wisum, Jos√© Tendetza, Freddy Taish (...).
