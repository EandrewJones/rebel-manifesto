Quito, January 21, 2019  The Confederation of the Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE), condemns brutal crimes towards Martha (protected name), victim of group violation in Quito, and Diana Carolina R. 
, murdered on public roads in the city of Ibarra, at the same time, he transmits his solidarity in these moments of pain to his relatives and calls on the institutions of the State to manage with responsibility and in attachment to due process to do justice in These cases. 
Violence against women is a structural problem, which today shocks Ecuador, but it is essential to understand that it is universal and happens at all levels of society, it has nothing to do with nationality or social group. 
This leads us to a deep reflection on what thousands of women pass by daily, who are injured, denigrated, vessels, who suffer multiple violence, be psychological or verbal as they are victims of subtle aggressive manifestations but that they have been instaculated in the daily coexistence. 
Violence against women in Ecuador is an increasing social phenomenon, since it holds it a patriarchal structure, which does not know from borders and nations, in that sense, we are concerned that the national government emits pronouncements that promote xenophobia and call us The attention that from the highest instances of the government are feeding positions that cause more violence. 
It is urgent that the State generates normative systems for prevention, protection and eradication of this phenomenon and we all make aware of the problem that we live, to protect the human rights of women and strongly fight violence towards them. 
The CONAIE supports the citizen's request to demand justice in these cases, while rejecting any position and act of xenophobia that seeks to create a scenario of chaos in the country.
