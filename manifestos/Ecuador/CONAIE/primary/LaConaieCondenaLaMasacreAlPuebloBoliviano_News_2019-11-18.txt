The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, CONAIE, condemns the massacre to the Bolivian people exercised from the police and military force, covered with the Decree of Jeanine AÃ±ez, president self-proclaimed, which exempts the military criminal responsibility for his actions in repression Towards the protesters. 
This decree constitutes a violation of international human rights standards and promotes a "licensed license" in the exercise of violence, it is urgent to end these criminal scenarios against the Bolivian people. 
We urge international human rights agencies to act in front of the serious vulnerations to the HDRs that take place in Bolivia's brother, only on the last Friday, November 15, 9 people died, 115 were injured and another 200 were arrested In the context of repression, the excessive use of military and police force has left so far 24 deceased and hundreds of injuries. 
In the same way, we denounce the media fence and the violation of the right to information and the journalistic work that is imposed to hide all these facts. 
The Plurinational State of Bolivia is consolidated under the struggle processes of the social, indigenous, peasants, workers, mining, urban workers, who through the historical uprisings achieved, through the popular consultation, declared a plurinational status, this precedent would not have been possible without the strength of the Aymara people and Brother Evo Morales, union leader, peasant cocalero, who from below, representing the impoverished classes of Bolivia made lots of demands in the field, in the social, the political and cultural. 
The CONAIE recognizes this historic legacy and rejects the mechanisms by which the Bolivian ultraransch took advantage of the errors committed by the Government of Evo Morales to impose itself under repression and violence, with it a common agenda that was coming Gesting between the economic elites of Bolivia, in a plot with the hegemonic media and the interventionist policy of the IMF, again through the exercise of terror, hatred and discrimination attempts to get involved as referents of democracy. 
Under this context, the burning, dragging and denigration of the WIPHALA, indigenous flag and symbol of life and struggle of the peoples of America, as well as the activation of systematic violence, hate and extreme racism tax, above all, towards Indigenous women and all the Bolivian people; We denounced the intrusion of the fundamentalist and orthodox church in political affairs using the Bible to legitimize, as they did in the area of the colony, violence and extermination towards indigenous peoples and nationalities. 
Mobilizations in Latin America, Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, and different parts of the world call us a deep reflection, because they are the show of a continuous dispute between neoliberal and progressive governments, while the people put the dead, and the elites, domestic and transnational continue to be rich even more at the expense of the exploitation of the human being and nature. 
Also show the awareness and memory of the peoples that reject the recipes of the IMF, the cuts of social spending, the restriction of labor rights, the lack of public employment, the subsidies, among many other impositions of the governments, and the reaction of the Political-economic elites has been violence and death for our brothers. 
We solidate ourselves with Brother People Bolivia, with its legitimate struggle and with all the peoples of Latin America who are awakening the voices clamor that are not willing to bow down at the fascist and neoliberal, those who decide are not the ones above, such As the Ecuadorian people have demonstrated, the one who commands is the united people. 
Jaime Vargas.  President of the Conaie  .
