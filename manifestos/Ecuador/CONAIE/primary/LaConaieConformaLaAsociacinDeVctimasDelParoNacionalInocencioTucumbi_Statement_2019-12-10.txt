His death will be a symbol of resistance and tenacity in the search for truth. 
The State has tried to delegitimize our struggle, blame the victims of being the cause of the aggressions, has hidden information, has denied the truth, which is why the first legal action we will take is before the constitutional court a request for declassification of Documents with a reserved, secret and secrecy character.

In this way, the institutions of the State are urged immediately the persecution of leaders and protesters through the abuse of criminal law and the construction of speeches covered in discrimination, stigmatization and bad faith. 
Urge the Ecuadorian State that efficiently and effectively guarantees the life, integrity and safety of all the people that we have manifested and exercised our rights and public freedoms, suffering the consequences of the environment of repression, especially against leaders of indigenous movement, girls , Children, adolescents and women.
