Quito, April 26, 2019  Press release  The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, Conaie, expresses its position against the firm by the National Government of Decrees: 722 on the "Update, Definition and Emission of the New Mining Policy of the State, as well as the guidelines for its application and corresponding execution "; and 724 that establishes reforms to the Regulation for price regulation of hydrocarbon derivatives. 
The CONAIE opposes the establishment of the "new mining policy" that the National Government intends to impose to ensure the commitments assumed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and thus receive the line of credit and comply with the covenants with this body, in a panorama which places the natural resources of the State in total deliveries to the transnational conditions of mining corporations and transnational capital. 
Although President Lenín Moreno in December 2017, he affirmed the cessation of all mining and oil concession, assessing the conditions under which those that were already operating; and then in February 2018 he ratified the annulment of two thousand mining concessions, today attentive to his word and promotes the conditions to expand mining in the territories of peoples and nationalities that clearly and organizedly have said no to extractivist policies and Yes to the defense of nature, promoting developmental alternatives that respect the environment. 
In this sense, with the announcement of the company In Metals to continue exploiting the Páramo de Quimsacocha, we are emphatic to announce that we will not allow me to make fun of the popular will of the town of Girón who said no to mining, with 86% of the votes In the popular consultation, and expressed its defense to water and life. 
On the other hand, we echo the popular feeling of restlessness and fear that the announcement of the price of natural gas of industrial use, is the previous step for the rise in the price of domestic gas, as happened with the price of the Super gasoline with the economic measures applied in the first months of 2019, that is, that the neoliberal policies imposed by this Government will continue to apply affecting the most impoverished sectors of the countryside and the city of the country
Faced with this scenario, Conaie sustains its ideological and political independence with the Government, while ratifies its historical resistance position against the privatization attempt of the strategic sectors and the economic measures that constitute a total transfer of the country to the conditions Imposed by the IMF, we encourage students, workers, social organizations, farmers, retirees, artisans, doctors and all popular sectors affected by government decisions to be alert and organized. 
By the Governing Council  Jaime Vargas.  President of the Conaie  .
