Quito, August 07, 2019  Press release  The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, Conaie, expresses its support and support for the great national march for the art and culture of this Wednesday, August 7, 2019, and requires respect for the rights of all artists, managers, Students, workers, art organizations and culture, who have been affected by budget cuts, without technical and legal sustenance, applied to the cultural sector. 
We join the senses demand pushed from the workers of art for the defense and redistribution of the resources of culture, the breach of the Organic Law of Culture and its Regulations, Social Security, Transparency in the Management of Funds and the Judgment against representatives of the "Lawyer" version of culture, which, using their position as ministers, sub-professionaries and directors, failed to comply with the laws and paid the land for the reproduction of bourgeois hegemonic power. 
The CONAIE ends the requirement for the creation of permanent public policies for the strengthening of the artistic and cultural sector, taking as a fundamental basis the diversity of cultural expressions and manifestations, heritage, historical memory and the knowledge of our peoples and nationalities as invaluable elements of our country. 
Solidarity and strength Companions and colleagues  #LaculturaEnemergence  Conaie communication  .
