Press release  The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador - CONAIE, Government of 14 Peoples and 19 Nationalities of Ecuador, we express our energy solidarity with our sister Relmú Ñamku, leadership of the historic Mapuche nation, Wincul Newen community, today prosecuted as a terrorist by the American company Apache , now in the hands of Argentina's state YPF. 
We reject the criminalization of the legitimate right of the originating peoples to defend the autonomy of their territories, against the incessant advance of extractive companies that throughout the continent, besieged our peoples under the logic of dispossession and the destruction that allows it to allow Fill in the reproduction of capital. 
The persecution of Relmú is another of the thousands of evidence showing the connivance of Latin American States with the extractive, primary exporting model, far from the aspirations of good living, of Sumak Kawsay, or as the Mapuche brothers, from Küme Feleal 
It also demonstrates as the justice, racist and colonial systems, in all corners of our America prioritize the "legal security" of transnational investments, on human rights and the guarantee of the rights of indigenous peoples recognized in international treaties. 
Finally, we join the complaint made by the Nobel ADOLFO Pérez Esquivel Prize, who showed that "Rellmu Ñ Maku accused her for being a woman and indigenous", putting on the rug the patriarchal nature of the model of violence, judicialization and legitimation of the dispossession , that indigenous women of Ecuador know and live in their own flesh when power does not accept that we are at the head of our struggles for life. 
Mashi Relmú, brothers and sisters of the indigenous peoples of Argentina, are not alone. 
Solidarity is not just the tenderness of the peoples, it is the blood that keeps the resistance alive. 
Shuk Shunkulla, Shuk Yuyaylla, Shuk Make!  (A single heart, a single thought, a single fist)  .
