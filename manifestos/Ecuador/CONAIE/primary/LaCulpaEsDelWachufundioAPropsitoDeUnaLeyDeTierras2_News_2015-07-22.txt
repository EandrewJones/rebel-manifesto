This document constitutes an analysis of the development model in the field that promotes the citizen revolution. 
For this, we propose a critical reading of the Organic Law Project of Rurallands and Ancestral Territories prepared by the Food Sovereign Commission of the National Assembly, which was discussed in Parliament and which, currently, is in the second phase of prelegisive consultation To towns and nationalities inscribed and qualified. 
As Ocaru, we believe it is important to analyze the laws over the field because they are measures that influence the lives of peasants and peasants, towns and nationalities and rural workers, and define the model for the field. 
That's why, we left for asking ourselves, who do the laws and approve them? In this first part we show the speeches and policies that the current government has on the field: debates and approaches, content and technical, economic and political analyzes; That is, how the current government, represented in most of the Assembly, defines the main problems of the field and how they offer responses to solve them in terms of economic growth, technological innovation, productivity, cultural change and combat to poverty.
