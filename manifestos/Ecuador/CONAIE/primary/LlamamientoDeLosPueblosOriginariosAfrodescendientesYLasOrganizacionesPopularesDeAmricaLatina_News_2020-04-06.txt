Calling from the original peoples, Afro-descendants and popular organizations in Latin America. 
The crisis that has globally caused the VOCID-19 presents a crossroads to the peoples of Abya Yala - Latin America. 
Popular organizations are the first line of resistance against the worst expressions of the decomposition system:   We are going through a comprehensive crisis that threatens life in all its forms. 
The Covid-19 was transformed into a pandemic in a moment of aggravation of the capitalist crisis and repeated attempts since the economic power that the working class loads behind their backs with the recomposition of the decreasing entrepreneurial rate; That it converges with the weakening of health systems, the deterioration of living conditions and the dispossession of the public as a result of the neoliberal twist. 
The suffocation to which the external debt, international organizations and the permanent agobium of imperialism against our sovereignty are forming a scenario that anticipates the serious consequences. 
In an America where we refused to accept the structural adjustments and disembarkation of new imperialist policies, and where our peoples have incarnated important popular uprisings in recent months, the pandemic has become an excuse to legitimize the presence of the armed forces in Our territories and implement adjustment measures and the deterioration of the conditions of existence of the working class. 
Likewise, this crisis revealed again the brutality of patriarchal violence on sexual women and disidencies, as well as the historical exclusion of indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples exposed to face pandemic in extreme vulnerability. 
As is the best tradition of our people, we are the organizations of the people, workers, peasants, from original peoples, feminist, Afro-descendants, piqueterras, of inhabitants, the neighborhoods, which we are putting the body, the head and the heart In developing immediate answers, but also to project an exit to this crisis that is not a return to the wild capitalist normality, but a path to a different society. 
This will be possible if we take the best of us as peoples, community ties and popular, territorial and regional unity, that we feed during this battle, will be part of the tissue that builds the transformation horizons in Abya Yala. 
In the face of the lack of housing we occupy territories and build houses; Given the lack of work we organize cooperatives, we recover factories and face closures, layoffs and suspensions; Before the patron attack we fight for better working conditions through strikes; In the absence of education, we generate schools; Given oppression towards women and disidencies we build popular feminisms; Before exploitation we build a basic union organization and fight against precarization and worthy salaries until the last consequences; Against hunger we build dining rooms and merenders; Faced with the climate crisis we develop agroecology; Facing the monoculture and the monopoly of food, we build agri-food peasant territories to guarantee sovereignty and food autonomy; Given the militarization, paramilitarism and drug trafficking are replacing crops and struggle against state violence. 
Our alternative is of life against those who propose death. 
Faced with closed border and fragmentation policy, and against xenophobia and neofascism that propose from above, we resume the horizon of continental solidarity and the unity of peoples. 
Faced with the policies of the capitalists, to use the crisis as a coating of the adjustment, let us go and rethink our historical struggles for the defense of the territories, life and socialization of riches, we build popular and community power. 
Therefore, we demand from governments and call the peoples:   Prioritize life on debt. 
Not to the payment of the external debt, exhaustive research and condonation of it. 
It is criminal to escale funds to health and rights, to pay for obligations with the IMF and other creditors. 
Health and social protection systems to face the pandemic are the priority. 
We need to recover our strategic wealth and the management of banks and foreign trade, a permanent source of the economic bleeding of Latin American countries. 
Only one policy of economic sovereignty, from the progress of popular power, can alleviate the economic crisis and the global that we are starting to live. 
Combat inequalities. 
Extraordinary tax to the rich, to the gain of banks and large companies, to those who escaped capital. 
That governments assume the role of eliminating inequalities promoted by the market, which the necessary investments in emergency policies are financed facing the concentration of wealth, not with salary sales to workers. 
Reorient the production lines of large companies for the generation of inputs destined to combat the coronavirus, as well as the diseases that we endure without attention from the state as malnutrition, dengue, chagas and tuberculosis. 
Urgent strengthening of public health systems. 
Urgent and Priority Investment in the Public Health System, Private Health Statization and Strengthening Measures of Pandemic Containment by States. 
The pandemic reaffirms the need for all and all receive universal health assistance, strengthening the public promotion of these services. 
That States take control of the production and administration of all the necessary inputs to face the crisis with participation and control of workers. 
Elimination of the patent system on medicines to fully develop research and scientific application to solve human problems, and recognition of originating and ancestral medicine. 
For work with all rights. 
Universal income guaranteed for all and all, prohibition of dismissals and suspensions. 
It is essential to recognize the rights of the workers to live a dignified quarantine. 
That this emergency is not the excuse to continue advancing in the precario of work. 
Not at the closing of companies, state support for its occupation and recovery by the workers. 
Housing and dignified habitat as a social law. 
Quarantine can only be carried out under a roof, with guaranteed basic services and in a healthy neighborhood. 
It is necessary to suspend evictions, rental payments and services; Habitat policies should be directed towards comprehensive urban reform that guarantees access to housing in decent neighborhoods for all working families. 
Universal access to water, light and gas and urbanization of popular neighborhoods: there is no fight against pandemic without all people to have drinking water, gas and access to electricity at home, neighborhood or community. 
Neither houses without people, nor people without houses. 
Requisition of empty properties for the population in street situation and popular shelters. 
Face hunger and guarantee universal feeding. 
Prioritize the financing and role of cooperative, community and agroecological family agriculture in the supply of food for the people, eaters, merewashers and community kitchens: it is necessary to advance in the promotion of access to food, as a way to promote the economy and not cause a supply crisis. 
Guarantee a basic basket with regulated prices and tax exempt. 
Require sanctions to speculation with prices The hoarding of supermarkets and intermediaries. 
Condation of the debts of the peasants and peasants, the redistribution of the productive land and implementation of protection systems and agroecological colonies with state financing. 
Against the commodification of nature. 
We need to recover sovereignty over our common assets such as water, gas, oil, land, strategic wealth that is usurped by economic octopus with the complicity of governments and local bourgeoisie. 
Full respect for the territories of the peoples and stake up of the economic and extractive model. 
The exploitation of natural resources must respect Mother Earth as thus to the peoples that inhabit it. 
Strengthening of sanitary fence and humanitarian assistance with guarantee of sovereignty of the territories to originating peoples, indigenous nationalities and Afro. 
Especially to all those whose habitat is in vital ecosystems such as the Amazon, for whom epidemiological threat can mean ethnocide. 
Strengthening of its own government and its systems for the territorial and cultural survival of the lives of indigenous and Afro peoples. 
Prohibition of evictions and actions that violate the sovereignty of indigenous peoples. 
Real policies to face macho violence. 
With social isolation measures, there is the possibility of increasing domestic violence and other forms of violence against women. 
That for women, cis and trans, the expansion of technological platforms to ensure their use when violence against women is a fact is not enough to prevent it and eradicate it. 
Budget to prevent femicides and transfendes. 
Shelters for people in a situation of violence, delivery of special economic subsidy to survivors. 
Employment and education plans oriented towards women and disidencies. 
More prevention, not to repression. 
Many governments have used the context of the Coronavirus to intensify repressive logic and surveillance, and to increase the imprisonment of the poorest, community leaders, human rights defenders. 
It is time to reduce the prison population as a public health problem. 
It is also necessary to revalue the own authorities and the Community, indigenous and popular guards who take care of the ancestral territories and are being a cash community organization to take care of life in the field and in the city. 
No to political, economic and imperialist military intervention. 
We categorically reject the use of the crisis as an excuse for military intrusion in Venezuela by the Yankee imperialism and its partners, the permanent murder of indigenous and popular leaders in Colombia, the fierce repression of the coup regime in Bolivia and Honduras, from Antipopular Government of Pi√±era in Chile, as well as the expansion of extractive projects in indigenous territories and peasants. 
We demand that blockots be lifted towards Cuba and Venezuela. 
Internationalist humanitarian aid. 
We demand from governments to request humanitarian aid to Cuba and other countries that have developed technical experience to face the pandemic and that can help contain the Covid-19 outbreak in the cities where the pandemic has expanded with more crudeness, how Guayaquil and Saint Paul. 
Against the richness of few, for the struggle of the peoples   For life, not the IMF!   How the Latin American peoples fight:  Saying-doing, saying-doing, saying-doing, fuck!   Internationalist solidarity, now!   Document on PDF.       Adhesions:   Fruit-urban resistance.
