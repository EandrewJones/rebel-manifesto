Last Monday, November 21, the Indigenous People Shuar de Nankints in Morona Santiago, decided to return to his territory after the forced evictions that occurred in August of this year. 
From that moment the tension in the area has been increasing. 
The situation of uncertainty about what is happening in the area is continuous, and there is absence of official information on the actions that are being undertaken from the State and about the arrests that are being carried out. 
Of special gravity, it is the scarce public communication offered from high-level authorities, such as the current Minister of Interior in Functions, Diego Sources Acosta, who has called on the judicialization of indigenous leaders without a clear knowledge of the concrete involvement and Real in the events that occurred. 
The area in conflict located in the Southern Amazon of Ecuador, province of Morona Santiago, is mostly the territory of the Shuar people. 
In this space, the Panantza-San Carlos project has been imposed, where they are projected to open two open-pit mines that will contaminate the territory with huge amounts of toxic waste and will use millions of liters of water affecting rivers and other water sources. 
At the end of exploiting the minerals, two craters will be two craters in the heart of the Cordillera del Cóndor and irreversible environmental, social and cultural impacts, especially in the Santiago de Panantza parishes, San Carlos de Limón and San Miguel de Conchay. 
For a long time in the country, indigenous organizations, peasants, human rights and ecologists have been alerting about the consequences that could be derived by the continued outrage to the rights of Shuar and peasant people in the Cordillera del Cóndor to give way to exploitation Minera 
There is a total absence of consultation and predisposition to listen to the demands of affected people and local voices. 
The population is subjected to continuous processes of criminalization, aggression and harassment. 
The 3 SHUAR indigenous murders committed in the area are still in impunity. 
In the last year, continuous processes of dispossession, expulsion and forced eviction have been carried out to deliver the territories to Chinese mining capital. 
Stresses the innoperation and even the connivance of the Ecuadorian State in the aggressions suffered. 
Despite this all this situation of daily violence, they are multiple legal and incidence actions, which have carried out the communities to seek dialogue and to inform the authorities their demands and affectations with the intention to be resolved. 
Several of them have been public:  - Demand for the rights of nature in the Cordillera del Cóndor, filed with the competent authorities:  - Request for a mining moratorium against the Ministry of Mining and Meeting request with the Minister for the opening of the mining cadastre:  - Presentation of precautionary measures to avoid further forced evictions:  - Order of intervention to the Ombudsman in the case of forced evictions and permanent information contributions during the last year. 
- Demand for lack of consultation to indigenous peoples in the case of the Panantza-San Carlos mining project in Nankints. 
- Delivery of information on violation of rights to national public entities, mainly ministries. 
- Public Hearing in the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) for the human rights situation of the Shuar People's leaders and defenders in Ecuador:
- Petition against IACHR by the Mining Mirador Project:
- Meetings, meetings and shipments of documentation to international organizations: NNUU (Indigenous Peoples Ratating and Housing), European Union, IACHR and Human Rights Entities:
- Case presentation in the International Court for the Rights of Nature in Peru:
- Delivery of indigenous delegation letters to the China embassy in Quito:
- Communication to Chinese banks that finance the project on the situation of violation of rights exerted by state companies Tongling and CRCC:
- Delivery of letters to the company China Tongling and CRCC:
All these actions, which are only a small part of those carried out, have been dismissed, not answered or discredited by the Ecuadorian State and mining companies, except for those carried out in international organizations. 
Since ecological action, we call on public authorities to address seriously and responsible manner what is happening. 
It is intolerable that before this situation of abandonment and violence lived in the area, public institutions justify the criminalization of indigenous peoples with political arguments, denonate the work of those who defend human rights and nature, and remove authority to the Actions undertaken by Shuar nationality, which before the dispossession of its territory has decided to exercise its territorial sovereignty against intrusive and polluting mining activities. 
This type of argument only account for the burden of racism existing in the discourse of governmental authorities, assuming the inability of the people and nationalities of Ecuador to make their own decisions and the exercise of the right to self-determination. 
We trust that the current situation does not end with a new attack of criminalization to the Shuar and peasant people in the area.
