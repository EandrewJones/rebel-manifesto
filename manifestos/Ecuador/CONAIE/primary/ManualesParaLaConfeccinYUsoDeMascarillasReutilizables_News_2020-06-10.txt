The CORONAVIRUS COVID-19 is transmitted through particles that we can not see. 
They leave the nose or mouth of an infected person when talking, sneezing or coughing. 
The mask serves to stop the passage of these particles. 
At the same time, it must be comfortable and allow you to breathe comfortably.
