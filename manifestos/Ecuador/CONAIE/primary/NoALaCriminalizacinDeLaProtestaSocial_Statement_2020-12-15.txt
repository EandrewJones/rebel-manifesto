, Quito, December 15, 2020  The CONAIE rejects the permanent state actions to criminalize the social protest and the right to resistance through the judicialization, persecution, complaints and harassment to the fellow social fighters, comuneros and indigenous leaders, who were at the national unemployment and uprising October 2019, they are now denounced by the State and by members of the Government that they make fun of economic advisers despite having committed serious acts of corruption and fleeing justice for 17 years. 
Such is the case of the colleagues of Imbabura: Fabián Cabascango of the Parish González Suárez, Alonso Tocagon, president of the Union of Indigenous Communities of San Rafael, and Manuel Quilago, of the community of Huaycopungo who are being investigated by the alleged crime of Kidnapping at the October 2019 unemployment, yesterday, Monday, December 14, they were called to surrender in the Otavalo Prosecutor's Office and the process is still in progress more commuvers. 
As Conaie, we express our support and accompaniment to our indigenous companions investigated by crimes that did not commit, in October 2019 the Base Communities of Babbage and the country, affiliate organizations, fraternal, mobilized Quito to exercise their right to resistance and defend the Rights violated by the Government of Moreno, there were repressed with brutality by the public force, while its territories were also militarized, the government is the true cause of violence by ordering the excessive use of force in repression causing 11 dead, thousands of wounded, detained and mutilated; Although we have denounced the State and its main policy makers, by these serious violations of human rights, such complaints do not have the same speed to do justice by the victims, this demonstrates the political persecution against us. 
Likewise, our Indigenous leaders Jaime Vargas, President of Conaie and Leonidas Iza Salazar, president of the MICC attended by Quito by the alleged crime of terrorism, research that opens from the complaint filed by Alberto Dahik, former vice president of the Ecuador, fugitive and current economic advisor of Lenín Moreno. 
Let us condemn these facts, then, the white-collar criminals, which should be behind the bars for stealing the money from all Ecuadorians and then fleeing for 17 years to evade justice, today are the complainants to indigenous leaders who face the Justice because they did not commit any crime, on the contrary, they raised their protest voice against the economic measures that affected Ecuadorian families in October 2019. 
We are aware that this persecutory wave will increase in this government, but we will remain mobilized and in permanent resistance by the defense of our rights, we will support incessantly to peers, indigenous leaders and popular fighters who are being criminalized by exercising their rights to the Resistance, to the organization and the protest. 
The unity and the fight between the peoples, exploited of the field and the city against the oppressors is the way.
