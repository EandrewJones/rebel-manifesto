Quito, November 15, 2017  Remember that massacre of the year 1922, November 15, is to recognize the tireless struggle of the workers' sector, peasant, who in the search for a dignified life, of a worthy work crossed and traversed atroples by the dominant, capitalist sectors and shift governments. 
For this reason, for the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador-Conaie, it is a fundamental challenge to maintain unity with workers, peasants, students, teachers, doctors, housewives, cholos, mestizos, intellectuals and other sectors violated, dominated , oppressed from the field and the city. 
It is essential to build a path between those by history we have suffered. 
Our ideological and political conviction is historical. 
We walked in the finding of a true social transformation that allows to improve the living conditions of those in history we have been marginalized. 
Our gratitude to the workers, trade union, peasant, hardworking and country worker and city. 
For all and all who offer their lives, as Conaie we say that the fight continues and therefore we accompany on this day of vindication, now, together between the union sector and the peoples of the coast.
