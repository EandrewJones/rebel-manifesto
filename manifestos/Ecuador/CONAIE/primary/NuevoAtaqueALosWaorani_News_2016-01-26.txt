According to Alicia Cahuiya, an indigenous Huaorani deceased and a wounded woman, would be the result. 
This moment is managing the transfer of the corpse and the wound to a health center. 
The attack would have occurred by the group before called "Armadillo", in the area of the Boamano community, very close to the Armadillo field and within the intangible area, before the Bameno community. 
This moment is a team of the Ministry of Justice traveling to the area and they are the ones who must respond to why this type of attacks continues, since their task supposedly is to avoid them.
