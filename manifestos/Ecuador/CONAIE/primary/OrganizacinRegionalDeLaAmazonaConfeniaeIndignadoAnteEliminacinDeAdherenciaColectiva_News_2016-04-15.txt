By finding the Gates of the VIII Congress of the Plurinational Unit Movement Pachakutik, MUPP, the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon, Conféde, expresses before public opinion:  Conféniae, as an adherent member of Pachakutik, expresses his disagreement with the decision of the National Electoral Council, CNE, with which we are excluded from being able to participate in a voice and vote in Congress, which evidences the Divisionist Afan that throughout These years has been promoted from the central government. 
Despite this, as members of the MUPP we will be present with our delegation in the city of Guayaquil to celebrate a democratic day on Saturday, April 16. 
In coherence with the mandates of the indigenous movement and the organicity that as such practications, the conference supports the candidacy of partner Marlon Santi for the National Coordination of the MUPP, a decision that has been taken into a conceanse among the regional of our glorious Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuador, Conaie, who support Marlon due to his proven experience, commitment and consequence with the historical struggle of peoples and nationalities. 
We identify with the option of partner Marlon as a representative of the collective adherents of the Plurinational Ecuador and the social sectors historically excluded from our country. 
His candidacy was established through a regional consensus at the Regional Assembly maintained last March with the Amazonian provincial directions, where the designation of Marlon was reached by regional consensus. 
Finally, we urge to develop the VIII Congress of MUPP in a democratic way with the firm objective of strengthening our movement and without responding to particular interests. 
We are sure that unity, the struggle and the consequence will prevail for the benefit of our bases and Ecuadorian society.
