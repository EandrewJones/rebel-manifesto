This December 8, from 8 o'clock in the morning, the audience summoned by the Pastaza Prosecutor's Office against the August 13. 
The support of the social sectors and the Amazonian people has been continuous during these 4 months of fiscal instruction against 15 people, of which 10 remain even with open process and 10 were released after remaining prisoners 2 months in some cases and 3 months in others. 
A long and strenuous day is avoided for which the solidarity people have self-linked to support the families of the judicialized in the outskirts of the Judiciary of Pastaza, demanding justice because they fight is not a crime. 
Jorge Herrera, president of the CONAIE, together with his Government Council and Legal Department will be present and will demand the file file for the lack of reliable evidence against criminalized, as well as the evidenced legal inconsistencies in a process that started with the unfair arrest of 34 citizens on the night of August 13 and the prison during a period of 2 to 3 months against 10 citizens later released due to lack of evidence, demonstrating that throughout the fiscal instruction there was a lack of legal independence and an attachment of Justice to the pressures and interests of the government to intimidate the people and demobilize it. 
Everyone to back up our colleagues this Tuesday of Dictimbre.
