At night on Tuesday, December 20 and beginning of 21 in the canton, the raid of the Interprovincial Federation of Shuar Centers, FICSH, and the arrest of its Agustín Wachapá president is also reported. 
"Approximately 100 uniformed from the public force surrounded and entered the FICSH facilities at the time destroyed everything, led computers and forced furniture where the archives of global land rested; They did not say anything, everything happened when we were resting approximately at midnight, "ARUTAM voice officials relate Radio. 
What happened represents an indignant violation of the collective rights of indigenous peoples and nationalities never seen before seen in the history of our country, nor in the times of the military dictatorship. 
After militarizing the Shuar territory with thousands of military sowing terror between peasant and indigenous families of San Carlos Panza and communities in the sector, the national government has lameed against popular leaders and leaders, stopping five peasants in some cases and asking for rewards in others , Situation at which the current detention is added. 
It is aberrant to verify as the Government has generated the conditions of violence in Shuar territory to favor the business and interests of mining transnationals, becoming a police state that asmembrants and pursues leaders as if they were criminals, while not acting with it Celerity with characters that have caused true damages to the country for acts of corruption. 
Instead of promoting the debate around the mining problem as at this time the country demands, has opted by the way of repression, militarization and persecution. 
As it confused, we totally reject these attacking actions against the integrity of our historical organizations, especially the FICSH, the largest organization of the country and founder of the Conaie and Confédee. 
We take responsibility for the Government of what could happen with the life of our brother Agustín Wachapà and once again do a call to national and international public opinion and human rights agencies to repudiate these facts and take immediate measures that allow the Peoples have guarantees since at this time we are in total indefension and the safety of leaders are danger with unpredictable consequences and a State that does not guarantee any protection and that on the contrary acts with the clear intention to silence our voice.
