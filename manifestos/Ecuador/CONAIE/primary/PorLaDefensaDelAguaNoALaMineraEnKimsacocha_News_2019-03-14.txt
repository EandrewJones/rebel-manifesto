We express our rejection of this claim to sabotage the struggle of the Azuay communities for the defense of its territories and give way to a protection action that favors a prominent group, represented by three members of the collective by the development of the Cantons Gir칩n and San Fernando. 
The popular consultation in Kimsacocha is the result of the permanent struggle of the Azuay communities together with the indigenous movement for the defense of water, the process was stagnated for 3 years even though the requirements for its call was fully fulfilled, the 24th of March must continue with the electoral process and the right of peoples to be consulted by compulsory and constitutional compliance. 
The judges do not act in defense of the nature and the right of peoples to be consulted, with the resolutions issued they put at risk the life of the moors and sources of water, while favoring mining companies. 
The CONAIE, adds to the clamor of the town of Gir칩n and San Fernando prior to the popular consultation and trusts that the CNE will guarantee the rights enshrined in the Constitution, due to the democratic participation of the communities and peoples to be consulted on the mining activity that It affects its territories and puts water sources at risk.
