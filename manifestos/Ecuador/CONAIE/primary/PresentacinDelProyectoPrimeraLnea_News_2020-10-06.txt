Artistic Memory and Documentary of the National Arrival Ecuador 2019  The contents of the project will be disseminated in October through social networks. 
Dear colleagues, through the present I would like to present the "First Line" project, by the Ana Rosa Valdez art curator. 
For months, artistic and documentary expressions have been collected that account for what happened during the past demonstrations of the month of October 2019. 
There is currently a file with numerous photographs, illustrations, videos, as well as other forms of artistic expression that account for the importance of indigenous lifting for Ecuadorian society. 
The purpose of the project is to keep the memory of unemployment alive, considering that there are several interests by silencing the popular will. 
The objective is also to show the creativity that also characterized the protest's days, and to account for other stories that go beyond the official version and the great means of this event. 
The collected images have begun to be disseminated through social networks of the first line project.
