Quito, September 11, 2019  Press release  The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, Conaie, before the Declaration, by the National Assembly, of September 11 of each year as "National Day of the Republic", in tribute to the Constitution of 1830; and the recommendation of the Ministry of Education "so that during this day the celebration of it is available in all the educational campuses of the country," we manifest the following. 
For the indigenous peoples and nationalities of Ecuador, declare the "National Day of the Republic" means legitimizing the historical dispossession of community territorial rights, recalling a constitution of imposition and obedience, limiting in collective rights, which granted omnipotent power to the great landowners And mining slavers. 
This celebration predisposes a tribute to the oligarch, patriarchal, racist and clerical elites that promoted discriminatory practices for the indigenous population. 
At 189 years of the first Constitution, the peoples and nationalities are asked: Are collective rights respected, the declaration of Plurinational and Intercultural State? Or the power of the elites continues to be legitimized and delivering the territories for their looting. 
We demand to the National Assembly and all State institutions respect and application of indigenous rights, the protection of their ancestral territories, the preservation of their knowledge and traditions, promote the full exercise of their rights and self-determination, and the implementation of policies Public and really democratic public at the service of all Ecuadorians. 
By the Governing Council  Jaime Vargas.  President of the Conaie  .
