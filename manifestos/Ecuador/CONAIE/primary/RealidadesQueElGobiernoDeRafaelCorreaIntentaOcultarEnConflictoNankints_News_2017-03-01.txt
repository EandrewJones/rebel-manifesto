Communists do not have guarantees to return to their communities and the situation of calamity and overcrowding is current without having made the lowest attempt to solve a conflict that persists for the disability of the scheme to understand that the topic of fund Environment of conflict in Shuar territory Ratals just in the mega mining in the southern Equatorian East. 
Faced with these irrefutable facts, we determinely require the Ecuadorian Government to recognize the facts and do not hide the Gravisian Human Rights of the Shuar People, 2 months of the State of Exception have just justified the militarization of the territory with the deep affectation to the collective rights of the Peoples and nationalities. 
We demand the total demilitarization of the Shuar territory and the repair of the damage caused by the unconscious action of the armed forces under the orders of the Ecuadorian State, unique and directly responsible for the violence that supposedly rejects but that on the contrary it has generated the military Shuar territory . 
We urge national and international human rights agencies to ensure the compensation of the violerated rights of the Shuar people and social organizations, public opinion and community in general to join stocks of solidarity before the drills committed.
