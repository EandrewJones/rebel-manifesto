Quito, December 2, 2016  Today, Friday, December 2, 2016, it was known that Marcelino Chumpi, Prefect of Morona Santiago, was sentenced to 2 years in prison for alleged case of peculous, in the construction of the Bridge over Río Bombioza, Canton Gualaquiza, by judges of the province . 
This evidences a clear persecution and criminalization against those who question and criticize the Government model with which the current regime operates. 
This fact reveals that it is political persecution against prefect. 
In previous days it was Cléver Jiménez who suffered unfairly follow-up of Ecuadorian justice for saying "dark realities" (then received Habeas Corpus because he was not able to prove his guilt). 
While, those who are involved in case Petroecuador, where there is sufficient evidence, do not receive any conviction of justice. 
That is why as a Confederation of the Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, Conaie, we raffle our support to the different works that the prefect of the province is carrying out in its territory for the benefit of the indigenous people and the most impoverished sectors. 
In addition, we call on to the national government that ceases the persecution and criminalization to the indigenous, social and popular sector, because all we do is claim due to the absence of answers to our requests. 
By the Governing Council  Jorge Herrera.  President Conaie.  .
