Quito, April 12, 2019  Press release  The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, Conaie, actively supports the permanent resistance processes of the Waorani people in the province of Pastaza against the oil extraction that puts its territory and resources at risk. 
The peoples and nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon have resisted without truce to the attack of extractivist policies, today the struggle of the Waorani de Pastaza focuses on defending about 200. 
000 hectares of tropical jungle that includes a huge biodiversity. 
They have said firmly: "Our territory is not on sale." 
The Conaie closely follows the judicial process carried out by the Waorani people, in the accompaniment of the Ombudsman's Office, in the Provincial Court of the Puyo, with a demand for protection against the Ministry of Energy and Non-Renewable Natural Resources, the Secretary of Hydrocarbons and the Ministry of Environment of Ecuador to stop the bidding of block 22 and seek to apply and guarantee the right of peoples to a real prior, free and informed consultation; In addition, due to respect for self-determination, the territory and the rights of nature. 
Likewise, we repudiate the vitiated process that took place in 2012 from the then Undersecretariat of hydrocarbons, in which, with disinformation and manipulation of the communities the State tried to evidence the realization of a supposed consultation, however, the Actions were taken as an elementary signature collection process to promote the income of oil companies to Waorani territory, to the detriment of constitutional law to prior, free and informed consultation. 
We call the national government and justice officials to respect this process to safeguard the culture, territory and natural resources, complying constitutional, human, collective and environmental rights. 
How long the unity of peoples in resistance!  By the Governing Council  Jaime Vargas.  President of the Conaie  .
