Quito, December 18, 2018  The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador-Conaie by observing the development of session 563 of the Plenary Assembly where the second debate is given to the reforms to the Communication Law insists on the defense of the rights of access to communication for The peoples and nationalities and in the defense of communication as a human right, in addition, recalls the importance of community media for the exercise of collective rights, based on a free, intercultural, inclusive, diverse and participatory communication. 
The direct assignment of frequencies for peoples and nationalities is no favor that is included in the Communication Law, but, it is the direct route for the exercise of collective rights and for a real democratization of communication, since the State must assume the Historical debt with communities and social sectors that have not been able to access Community communication on equal conditions, as the monopolies of the media have dominated over time the mechanisms of access and participation. 
At the same time, it recognizes the work of the Commission on Collective Rights of the National Assembly to sustain the contributions made from the peoples and nationalities of communication, and we consider as a progress for construction From a law of democratic communication to maintain the equitable distribution of radio spectrum frequencies intended for the operation of radio and television stations open in three parts: 33% for the operation of public media, 33% for media operation Private, and 34% for the operation of community media. 
The indigenous movement and the entire Community Communication sector reject the pretensions of reforming the law with the proposal for automatic renewal, and without competition, of frequencies for the benefit of private media. 
To be approved this approach, a barrier would be bearing to achieve the fulfillment of the tripartite distribution and would attack against the democratization of the radio spectrum. 
We are vigilant that the pressures of political and business interests of communication monopolies do not pass over the collective interests and contributions made by organizations, sectors, social and community movements to include reforms to the communication law that guarantee the rights of all and all.
