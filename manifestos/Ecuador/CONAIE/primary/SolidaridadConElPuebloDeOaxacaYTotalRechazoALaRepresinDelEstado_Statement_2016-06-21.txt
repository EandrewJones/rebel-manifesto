At the distance we want to tell you colleagues and companions we are with you, you are not Solxs. 
Therefore, full of indignation before inhuman act by the State of Mexico, we want to make public our total rejection of repression, abuse of power, to the use of public force unduly to attack against a people who defend their rights, Your right to education and dignified conditions for teachers and students. 
The groups can not be able to impose an educational reform, which as it is already heard throughout the continent, has nothing educational but aims to snatch the right to education to the people of Mexico. 
We greet the courage with which the National Coordinator of Education Workers (Tenta) and the People of Mexico reject the reforms and defend their right to education. 
From the indigenous peoples and nationalities of Ecuador we reiterate our solidarity.
