Quito, April 27, 2017  On May 1 it is the day of struggle of workers. 
It is the practical tribute to the lives of thousands of partners and comrades fallen in the struggles of workers, peasants, indigenous, women, of youth, diverse struggles in different geographies, so that today we have minimal rights. 
In that diversity our current struggles are. 
We indigenous peoples are field workers, but we are also on trade, in industry, etc. 
We embodiment in our same movement, the need for unity between the countryside and the city, and we recognize ourselves in the struggles of those below, whether or not they are indigenous, because today they are our struggles. 
Let us vote on this May 1, the unit of those below, because we also recognize that all of us who are exploited and oppressed by capitalist power we share an identity, faced with the interests of businessmen, financial capital, of the renewed Agricultural oligarchy, of transnational extractivists, and from the state that shows these interests. 
It is between those below that we will build the social transformation and the structures of a system where capital over human, collective well-being of our bases and its territories prevail. 
In the context of the conjuncture that we cross in Ecuador, since the CONAIE we call to resume with clarities the strategic unity of the exploited, and to fight for the guarantee of rights:  Our first requirement: Amnesty all political prosecutes and persecuted, because there is no way to move on other fronts if we are not all. 
We lack prisoners and criminalized!  For a 1st of May combative, for respect for labor rights, for respect for popular organizations, due to the defense of free territories of extractivism. 
We summoned our bases to be present in the different mobilizations at the national level, raising our claims in a single unit voice.
