Quito, May 17, 2018  The Confederation of the Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador - CONAIE obtains a favorable response from the National Assembly by changing the status of private indigenous university to public public nature, through the second debate of reform to the Organic Law of Higher Education that was given this May 15 of 2018. 
In this second debate, Conaie has managed to restore the Intercultural University of Indigenous Peoples Nationalities Amawtay Wasi with public university status, community character. 
It will have academic, administrative, financial and organic autonomy. 
This change will force the State to assume financing within the General Budget of the State for its operation. 
The Intercultural University of Indigenous Peoples Nationalities Amawtay Wasi was closed during the evaluation process implemented in the Rafael Correa regime on November 4, 2013 by the Higher Education Council - CES. 
Therefore, from arriving the project of reform to La Loes to the official registry with the articulates who are favorable for peoples and nationalities will be a sample of justice towards the indigenous sector. 
Finally, Conaie rejects the intentions of some legislators who have raised to move the headquarters of the University to a province outside the capital of the Republic. 
By decision of indigenous peoples and nationalities that are holders of this right will be respected that the parenting headquarters will be in Quito, as established by the Law of its Creation. 
We will support the provinces that want to take extensions of the university can do it effectively with the general budget of the State. 
We continue in the fight for free admission to the higher education of our young people.
