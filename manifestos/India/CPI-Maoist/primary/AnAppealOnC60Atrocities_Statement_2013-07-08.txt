AN APPEAL 

 

 
 

Raise your voice against the atrocities committed by the C-60 Commando force! 

 
On 7 July 2013, the notorious C-60 commandos engaged in anti-Naxal operations 
brutally murdered six women comrades of a guerilla unit of the CPI(Maoist) in front of 
the villagers after torturing them in Medri village of Gadchiroli district in the state of 
Maharashtra, India. These mercenary C-60 forces belonging to Maharashtra Police not 
only indulged in sadistic and repulsive behaviour towards the dead bodies of our fallen 
comrades, but even made video clippings of their abominable acts and are selling these 
clips and screening them publicly in the villages. 
 
Raise your voice against this atrocious act of dishonouring the dead bodies of women 
revolutionaries by the C-60 commando force!
