CPI(Maoist) condoles the demise of renowned 
social worker & friend of Adivasis Baba Amte 

 
 
Our Party's Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee expresses its heart-felt condolences on the demise of 
renowned social worker, friend of the adivasis and a partisan of the people, Baba Amte. With the death of 
Baba  Amte  the  people  of  our  country,  particularly  the  adivasi  masses  of  Gadchiroli  district,  have  lost  a 
well-wisher. He being a Gandhian, there are differences in ideology and outlooks between our Party and 
Baba  Amte  but  insofar  as  the  interests  of  the  adivasis  are  concerned,  Baba  Amte  had  always  been  an 
ardent  and  firm  supporter.  He  had  unequivocally  opposed  the  big  projects  like  Icchampalli,  Polavaram 
Narmada  etc  which  lead  to  massive  displacement  of  adivasis  and  cause  immense  damage  to  the 
environment.  By  establishing  the  organisation  known  as  'Lok  Biradari',  Baba  Amte  had  done 
commendable  work  in  the  field  of  health  and  other  spheres  for  the  welfare  of  adivasis.  In  spite  of  his 
ideological  differences  with  Naxalism,  he  considered  Naxalism  as  a  political  movement  that  drew  its 
strength from its ideology. He was a critic of the policies of state repression on the adivasis in Gadchiroli. 
We pay our humble homage to this social worker who had devoted his entire life to the well being of the 
adivasis and those who had been marginalised. And we convey our heart-felt feelings to his grief stricken 
family members, friends and colleagues.
