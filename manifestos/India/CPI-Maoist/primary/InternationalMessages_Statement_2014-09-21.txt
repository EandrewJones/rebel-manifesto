FOREWORD

As part of our endeavour to republish important party documents on
the occasion of the celebrations of ten years of the formation of CPI(Maoist),
we are bringing out here a compilation of international messages. This volume
includes messages sent by our party to fraternal parties, messages sent to
us by our fraternal parties and organisations from across the world as well
as statements jointly issued by us with other parties over the past decade.
Lenin had pointed out that true internationalism consists of carrying out
the revolutionary tasks in one’s own country and supporting this, and only
this line, in other countries. Our party, which is one of the detachments of
international proletariat, is carrying out this directive as a foremost task of
proletarian internationalism. To liberate the country from the clutches of
imperialism and domestic reaction and in leading the people in revolution,
our party strives resolutely to uphold the theory of MLM and to apply it
creatively to the concrete practice of Indian new democratic revolution as
an inseparable part of world socialist revolution. Close and lively fraternal
relations with revolutionary parties and organisations of other countries is
an important component of a Maoist party’s proletarian internationalist stand.
Be it the messages exchanged on significant occasions and events, on major
political developments or turns in the revolutionary movements of different
countries, to share the joy of important victories or in the grief of sad
losses, to affirm the solidarity of the proletarian parties and organisations
and to express our shared objectives, etc., stand testimony to these profound
feelings. They are recognition of each other as vanguard contingents of the
international proletariat, of the commonness of our aims and interrelation
of revolutionary practices. Messages carry the ideological, political views
of the party corresponding to this momentous decade. These documents
therefore have acquired historical significance. They are thus useful to
understand not only the party but provides a glimpse of the activities of the
Maoist revolutionary forces of the world in the last one decade.

 While messages express a party’s views and sentiments, joint statements
serve to bring out the collective viewpoint of Maoist parties on important
questions facing the international communist movement or developments
in the world. They are also a means of struggling to unify thinking and thus
they  aid  in  developing  a  common  understanding  for  the  international
communist movement. The advances made in this direction can be seen
from the statements collected here.

During the past decade, CPI(Maoist) exchanged messages with several
Maoist parties and revolutionary organisations across different countries on
various occasions on a wide range of issues. They gave us confidence and
strengthened our resolve in the course of struggle and in times of joy and
sorrow, reaffirmed our shared commitment to MLM, our common fight
against capitalism and determination to end all forms of exploitation and
oppression by establishing socialism and communism on a world scale.
They made us happy by letting us know that the advances made by our
revolution  are  enthusing  comrades  in  far  off  lands  and  that  they  are
shouldering the task of extending all possible assistance and support to the
Indian revolution with a true internationalist spirit - just the manner in which
every forward step taken by fraternal revoutionary parties of other countries
and every act of solidarity they take up fills the Indian revolutionary camp
with great joy and enthusiasm. These messages, whatever may be the occasion
on which they are issued, expresses the desire for stronger ideological,
political and organisational unity of the proletariat of all countries in the
course their common fight against the bourgeoisie to build a socialist world.
In these times, when the forces of counter-revolution, and its tool revisionism,
far outnumber the Maoist forces, when the absence of a socialist country
considerably weakens international support, messages and joint statements
serve to strengthen the forces of revolution. We hope this compilation will
help its readers understand how the CPI(Maoist) has striven to fulfil its
internationalist obligations as well as the reciprocal gesture from fraternal
parties and organisations.

CENTRAL COMMITTEE (PROVISIONAL)

21-09-2004

To,
The Chairman
Central Committee,
United Liberation Front of Asom

Dear Comrade,

Red Salute! It is with great pleasure we inform you that the two important
and major revolutionary parties of India, namely the Communist Party of
India(Marxist-Leninist)[People’s War] popularly known as CPI(ML)[PW]
and the Maoist Communist Centre of India, popularly known as MCCI and
also the two streams popularly known as M-L stream and MCC stream
have merged  into a single one and thus a new unified party, the Communist
Party of India(Maoist) based on MLM has come into being on 21st Sept.
2004. Our two armies – PGA and PLGA have also been merged and the
name of our united army is PLGA (People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army).
The new unified Party and Army pledge to fulfill the aims of our martyr
fore-founders and beloved leaders and teachers Com.Charu Mazumdar and
Com. Kanai Chatterjee.

 In this way a long cherished desire of the Maoist revolutionaries and
the revolutionary people including all those oppressed nationalities who are
resisting and fighting heroically against the brutal offensive of Indian ruling
classes and their imperialist chieftains all over India, has transformed into a
reality. Henceforth a new chapter in the history of revolutionary Communist
movement  in India has begun.

In this way we are now in a better position to stand by the side of all the
struggling nationalities including the oppressed nationalities of North-East
who are fighting for their just right of self-determination including the right
of secession.

September 2004 - August 2014  15

We  have  had  top  level  Party  to  Party  relation  with  the  erstwhile
organisations,  MCCI,  CPI(ML)(PU)  and  CPI(ML)[PW]  and  have
exchanged experience helped each other and taken up joint activities also,
to  fight  against  our  common  enemy  –  the  Indian  ruling  classes  and
imperialism. But thereafter that link could not be continued because of
various circumstances. Even then we continued our efforts from time-to-
time to reestablish that link but could not achieve successes.

You must be aware of the fact regarding the area in which we are
engaged in developing the revolutionary struggle in lower Assam. At that
level we have also some living link with your local organization. We had the
highest level of cordial relations from here also, but that relation could not
be continued because of various circumstances. Even then we continued
our efforts from time to time to restablish that link but could not achieve
success. It will be better if these relations are maintained and developed in
the sound direction. Hence in addition to establish relations at the highest
level we also hope you will definitely pay attention in improving these
relations by maintaining and developing mutual cordiality.

We hope and expect that you will be developing your movement against
our common enemy in correct direction. Lot of blood has already been
flown in the rivers of Assam. We express our deep revolutionary concern
for these sacrifices. We are of the opinion that these sacrifices will not go in
vain. We also hope that you and all of your fighting ranks will be maintaining
good  and  fighting  spirit. We  will  continue  to  value  and  support  your
movement by all means.

We will be eagerly waiting for your reply. Hope you will definitely and
positively respond to our letter and take appropriate measures to reestablish
the living link at the highest level and continue to maintain it.

Comrades, on the occasion of the formation of our new unified party,
the Communist Party of India (Maoist), we like to extend our heartiest and
warmest revolutionary greetings to you and your whole party, army and the
revolutionary masses of the oppressed nationalities of North East India.

On this occasion we also wish to remind you of the urgent task of
forging a united front of the communist revolutionary forces, the oppressed
nationalities and other democratic forces who are waging militant struggles
against the Indian state and imperialism in various forms.

Appeal to All Friends of Indian Revolution

1-10-2004

Dear Friends,
We extend our revolutionary greetings to all of you.

On Sept.21 of this year the two Maoist revolutionary streams represented
by the MCCI and the CPI(ML)(PW) merged and formed a new revolutionary
centre – Communist Party of India(Maoist). We can assure you that the
newly emerged Party will further strengthen the revolutionary movement
of the country and firmly advance, to accomplish its revolutionary mission.
We have already developed guerrilla zones in Dandakaryana, Jarkhand, AP
and Bihar. The peoples’ armed forces have been developed and the Peoples’
Liberation Guerrilla Army has emerged. To consolidate these achievements
we are advancing to establish Base Areas. We know that this achievement
would not be possible without your cooperation. We are ofcourse aware
that this is yet a mere beginning; we have a long way to go to unite the vast
majority of the Indian masses for the building of the new democratic society.
We hope you will also continue to be part of this historic process unfolding
in the country.

On this occasion we want to share our joy with you. We do not forget
you and your help, cooperation and assistance which encouraged us to go
ahead  and  fulfill  the  revolutionary  goals. We  do  also  remember  your
suggestions, comments and criticisms which helped us rectify some of our
short-comings and weaknesses. We do expect that you will not only continue
to help us in various ways but also come forward to take part in revolutionary
activities in the coming days.

 Once again we extend our warm revolutionary greetings to all of you.

Dear Comrades,
Red Salutes !

It is with great pleasure that we inform you that the two important and
major  revolutionary  parties  of  India,  namely  the  Communist  Party  of
India(Marxist-Leninist)[People’s War] popularly known as CPI(ML)[PW]
and the Maoist Communist Centre of India, popularly known as MCCI
[also known as the two streams of Maoists in India - M-L stream and MCC
stream] have merged  into a single new unified party, the Communist Party
of India(Maoist) on 21st Sept. 2004. This new Party has as its ideological
basis Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and will follow the path of protracted
people’s war to achieve victory of India’s New Democratic Revolution as
the first step towards the socialist transformation of society. Our late and
beloved leaders and teachers, Com. Charu Mazumdar and Com. Kanai
Chatterjee, will be recognized as the founders of this new Party.

In this way a long cherished desire of the Maoist revolutionaries and
the revolutionary people of India and abroad has transformed into a reality.
Henceforth a new chapter in the history of the revolutionary Communist
movement  in India has begun.

As Indians settled abroad, with strong feelings for the future of our
country and the Indian revolution, we specifically take this opportunity to
bring this important news of the merger to you. We are sure you will
appreciate the historic importance of this step for the future of our country
and the crores of the oppressed masses of India. We would first like to
briefly inform you of the process that finally resulted in this historic unity.
Before this new party came into being, the two parties conducted four
rounds of bilateral discussions on almost all the fundamental political,

September 2004 - August 2014  19

organisational and military questions in a very cordial manner. Through an
intensive and constructive discussion, the two parties  not only have been
able to prepare some basic documents (namely, Hold High The Red Banner
of  M-L-M, The Party Programme, The Strategy and Tactics of the Indian
Revolution, The Political Resolution on International and Domestic Situation,
The Party Constitution) but have also been able to enrich those documents
by synthesizing the valuable experiences gathered by both the parties through
their revolutionary practice over the last 35 years. Regarding the short period
of strained relations between our two organizations, both the parties have
made  a deep, sincere and thoroughgoing  self-criticism and have thus
successfully resolved all the questions related to that period of strained
relations recognized as a ‘Black Chapter’ in India’s revolutionary movement.
The CPI(Maoist) has also opined that though the major portion of the
Maoist revolutionaries have been unified through this merger process, still
the process of unifying Maoist revolutionaries has not been completed. So
the new party will accelerate it’s effort to unify the remaining Communist
Revolutionary groups, around the line established in the five documents,
with utmost importance and sincerity. The new party will also extend its
unflinching support to the ongoing people’s war in Nepal, Phillippines, Peru
and Turkey, and to the on going workers and people’s movements of Europe,
America and other capitalist countries, and also extends its full support to
the heroic Iraqi and Afghan people in their fight against American imperialist
aggression.

Indian’s settled abroad have a great patriotic and revolutionary tradition
of serving our great motherland. From the turn of the last century when the
Gadar  movement  in  Canada  sent  armed  detachments  to  India,  to  the
numerous Indians settled abroad who supported the freedom struggle from
there, and up to the earlier IWA-Great Britain [Indian Worker’s Association]
which  supported  the  great  Naxalbari  movement  led  by  Com.  Charu
Majumdar - all these and more have lent enormous support for the freedom
and liberation of their country of origin. We are sure you will continue in
this great tradition to continue to lend support for the freedom of our country
from imperialist rule and for the liberation of the vast masses from acute
exploitation and poverty.

You will realise that the freedom struggle was betrayed by the comprador
class in 1947 and that so-called independence as basically fake. Since then,
and even more so since the 1990s, the conditions of the masses of our
country have continued to worsen. The situation has gone so bad that
today thousands commit suicide each year. And these are not the poorest of
the poor, who are used to a pitiable existence, but those whose conditions
of life are dropping - they are peasants in deep debt, they are workers
thrown out of jobs, they are youth who see no future, they are young girls
who do not have the dowry for marriage and they are even small businessmen
who have gone bankrupt. Life is a nightmare for over 90% of the population;
i.e. over 90 crore people.

Today there is no other force in the country that can lead the struggle
for the freedom of our country from imperialist clutches and the liberation
of the masses from acute poverty, than the genuine Maoists. No doubt, till
now, with numerous Maoist groups and parties in the country, you may
have been confused as to which is the really effective force in the country.
But now with the merger of the two major Maoist streams in the country
and the birth of a unified Maoist Party in the country, together with their
people’s armies, there is no force that can stop the onward advance of the
revolutionary movement in the country. It is at such a crucial moment that
we request your support for the ongoing revolutionary movement in the
country. Your support can be of great importance to the advance of this
movement that can result in a historic change in the country of your birth.
Comrades,

We APPEAL to you to lend any type of support that you are able to do,
however limited it may be, for the Indian revolution. Some of the possible
ways in which you can assist the revolutionary process in our country
could be:

1) Popularise the Indian revolutionary movement abroad, particularly
amongst Indians, and thereby win over the vast section of the Indian
populace to the side of the Indian revolution. This can be done by
widely selling literature on the Indian revolution, and also by holding
meetings,  processions,  cultural  programmes,  etc  on  the  India

September 2004 - August 2014  21

revolutionary process. This can also be done from person to person
eliciting discreet support from individuals in various ways.

2) Lending solidarity with the Indian revolution through various means
like: condemning state repression, exposing the Indian rulers, etc.
3) Giving all kinds of support to the Indian revolution, like Financial,

Logistic and in any other way that you can  do.

4) Involve your families and friends in India to lend support and/or
participate  in  the  activities  of  the  Party  and  the  revolutionary
movement.

We  look  forward  to  your  close  involvement  with  the  ongoing
revolutionary process in the country. Everyday the best of Indian society
have been laying down their lives for the Indian revolution. The Maoist
parties itself have lost over 6,000 comrades from the days of Naxalbari till
today. In just the last one-and-a-half decades our two erstwhile parties
have lost over 3,000 comrades, including top leaders. These heroic comrades
have fearlessly faced the enemy bullets and given their precious life for the
revolution and the oppressed masses of India. Let us, in the memory of
these heroic martyred comrades, vow to put in maximum efforts to realise
the dreams of these fallen martyrs.

We look forward to your deepening involvement with the historic changes

taking place in our country.

Dear Comrade,
Red Salutes!

It is with great pleasure that we inform you that the two important and
major  revolutionary  parties  of  India,  namely  the  Communist  Party  of
India(Marxist-Leninist)[People’s War] popularly known as CPI(ML)[PW]
and the Maoist Communist Centre of India, popularly known as MCCI
[also known as the two streams of Maoists in India - M-L stream and MCC
stream] have merged  into a single new unified party, the Communist Party
of India(Maoist) on 21st Sept. 2004. This new Party has as its ideological
basis Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and will follow the path of protracted
people’s war to achieve victory of India’s New Democratic Revolution as
the first step towards the socialist transformation of society. Our late and
beloved leaders and teachers, Com. Charu Mazumdar and Com. Kanai
Chatterjee, will be recognized as the founders of this new Party.

In this way a long cherished desire of the Maoist revolutionaries and
the revolutionary people of India has transformed into a reality. Henceforth
a new chapter in the history of the revolutionary Communist movement  in
India has begun.

As Indians settled abroad, with strong feelings for the future of our
country and the Indian revolution, we specifically take this opportunity to
bring this important news of the merger to you. We are sure you will
appreciate the historic importance of this step for the future of our country
and the crores of the oppressed masses of India. We would first like to

September 2004 - August 2014  23

briefly inform you of the process that finally resulted in this historic unity.
Before this new party came into being, the two parties conducted four
rounds of bilateral discussions on almost all the fundamental political,
organisational and military questions in a very cordial manner. Through an
intensive and constructive discussion, the two parties  not only have been
able to prepare some basic documents (namely, Hold High The Red Banner
of  M-L-M, The Party Programme, The Strategy and Tactics of the Indian
Revolution, The Political Resolution on International and Domestic Situation,
The Party Constitution) but have also been able to enrich those documents
by synthesizing the valuable experiences gathered by both the parties through
their revolutionary practice over the last 35 years. Regarding the short period
of strained relations between our two organizations, both the parties have
made  a deep, sincere and thoroughgoing  self-criticism and have thus
successfully resolved all the questions related to that period of strained
relations recognized as a ‘Black Chapter’ in India’s revolutionary movement.
It is also with great pleasure we would like to inform you that the
People’s  Guerrilla Army(PGA)  and  People’s  Liberation  Guerrilla
Army(PLGA) which were formed by the erstwhile CPI(M-L)(PW) and
MCCI on 2nd December.2000 and 22nd April 2003  respectively, have also
been merged into one and the name of this newly formed army will be the
People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army(PLGA), and 2nd Dec. will be it’s
foundation day; the day of the martyrdom of the three CC members, Coms.
Shyam, Murali and Mahesh.

The newly formed party, the Communist Party of India(Maoist) firmly
based on the strategy of PPW has decided to accomplish the basic, principal
and immediate task of building up of people’s army and base areas by
intensifying the on-going agrarian revolutionary guerrilla war throughout
the country and has also decided to launch a new wave of revolutionary
mass movements by involving all the sections of the people against the
ruthless plunder, exploitation and oppression by imperialism, comprador
bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism.

The CPI(Maoist) has also opined that though the major portion of
the Maoist revolutionaries have been unified through this merger process,
still the process of unifying Maoist revolutionaries has not been completed.

and Turkey, and to the on going workers and people’s movements of Europe,

We consider the revolutionary movement in India as a detachment of
the world proletarian revolutionary movement and will do our utmost in
furthering proletarian internationalism. This we shall do by furthering deep
ties with the genuine Maoist forces around the world; uniting, on a principled
basis, with other democratic and anti-imperialist forces throughout the world;
and through lending support to all the struggling people throughout the
world, particularly those forces fighting imperialism and local reaction.

The confusion created by the existence of numerous groups in the
country claiming allegiance to Maoism is now coming to an end with the
birth of a single proletarian revolutionary party  in the country. Knowing
your strong desire for revolution in your home country we request you to
strongly identify and be a part of this new process that has begun in the
country of your birth as it is only this new party that can be the hope for the
crores of the oppressed masses of India. It is such a true proletarian party
that alone can free our country from the shackles of imperialism and all
reaction and build a country truly independent. In this the vast Indian
community abroad can play a major role.

Being settled in a new country you would have a dual responsibility:
firstly, support to the revolution in the country of your origin; secondly,
participation in the revolutionary movement  in the country that you have
taken up citizenship by uniting with the working class of that country.
Regarding the first task we would request you to take up the following
responsibilities to the maximum extent possible.

1) Popularise the Indian revolutionary movement abroad, particularly
amongst  Indians,  and  thereby  win  over  the  vast  section  of  the  Indian

will live up to this tradition and rebuild the organisation on the lines laid by
Com. Joshi in support of the Indian revolution.

All the necessary information (i.e. press release, souvenir, pamphlet,

Dear Comrades,
Red Salutes!

In separate letters we have informed you of the latest developments
where the erstwhile CPI(ML)(PW) and the MCCI have merged to form
the CPI(Maoist). The formation of a united Maoist party in India is no
doubt  a  historic  step  forward  in  the  advance  of  the  New  Democratic
Revolution in the country. The new party will seek to forge deeper ties with
all genuine Maoist forces in the world, including both your parties. We
hope to further the existing relations.

I think you will now appreciate why it was not possible for us to pay
serious attention to the international Seminar if was to be held in November
2004 as had been suggested by you, as we were deeply pre-occupied in the
merger preparations. That is why we suggested a postponement. Besides, it
would have been only the new party that could take decisions on such
international issues.

Now we have decided to continue our participation in the Seminar as
earlier planned. On this there is no change. But one problem has occurred.
Our representative from the International Department of the CPI(Maoist)
who was to come has been unable to get the necessary technical (passport)
documents to travel abroad. You will appreciate that the repressive nature
of the Indian rulers makes it difficult for leading members of our Party to
travel in-and-out of the country using legal channels. This has also made it
difficult to find any alternative. So, what we plan is to send our paper to the
seminar and this will be read out by our representative.

We regret of our inability to attend, but like to repeat that it was purely
September 2004 - August 2014  35

on account of technical reasons. We would appreciate if you could send us
a copy of all the papers presented in the Seminar and also the reports of the
different movements from various countries of the world. We will carry
these in our official organ.

We hope to not only continue our bilateral relations with both your
parties but also deepen it on the basis of principles, proletarian internationalism
and in the light of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. We look forward to your
earliest response. You could send a reply back with the bearer of this note,
though he may return only in end January.

Looking forward to closer relations.

Resist and Defeat all the Evil Designs by the Indian
Government against the Liberation Struggle of the

Nepal People under the Leadership of the

Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)

The Congress-led UPA government at the central has promised all help
to Gyanendra, the king of Nepal. Only a few days back the Union Home
Minister has declared that India will render all assistance to Royal Nepal
Army like supplying all types of military equipment, training RNA personnel
and sealing the border. It is not difficult to understand the essence of this
statement. The Indian ruling classes are going to wage an undeclared and
deceit war against the Nepali people and the People’s Liberation Army
under the leadership of CPN(Maoist).

Actually, the BJP led NDA government itself wanted to get directly
involved into the affairs of Nepal. But the US government, after capturing
Iraq, wanted to deal directly with the affairs in Nepal. They sent many
military advisers to the RNA camps. They were supervising RNA cam-
paigns against the PLA. The erstwhile NDA government tried its best to
intervene a number of times to interfere into the national liberation struggle
led by LTTE in Sri Lanka. It may be recalled that the Rajiv Gandhi regime
sent the so-called peace keeping force into Sri Lanka in 1987 as per an
agreement with Sri Lanka government. Before that Indira Gandhi regime
dismembered Pakistan in 1971 in the name of liberating Bangladesh and
wanted to install a puppet government there. Later it annexed Sikkim. Only
a few months back the India government conducted a campaign inside
Bhutan with the aim of crushing the liberation struggle in Assam under the
leadership of ULFA. For the last one month it has been conducting a
campaign near and within Mayanmar border in collaboration with Mayanmar
government to crush the PLA of Manipur. All these show how the Indian
government plays the role of a bully to serve the interests of imperialism

and its own class interest in the Indian sub continent.

For the last few years the Nepali people are waging struggle against the
monarchy under the leadership of the Maoists with the aim of establishing a
new democratic society. Imperialists and all the reactionary forces are fiercely
opposing their revolutionary struggle of Nepal. The CPM, one of the main
props of UPA government at the centre may show an apparent opposition
to this decision at the all India level. But in West Bengal, where they are in
power, they are not sparing any chance to play their role in crushing the
revolution in Nepal in the name of oppos-ing ‘terrorism’. They have arrested
many leaders and activists of CPN(M) including Com. Mohan Baidya, one
of the topmost leaders in Bengal.

Our CC(P) will mobilize the Indian people in solidarity to the great
revolutionary strug-gle of the Nepal people against the unjust deeds of the
Indian government. We are confident that if the Indian govternment dares
to send its mercenary army for suppressing the revolution in Nepal it will
have to incur the same shameful defeat as it had in Sri Lanka in the 1980s.
The CC(P) calls upon all the revolutionary and democratic people of the
Indian subcontinent to rise in united struggle against the expansionist Indian
ruling classes and their mercenary army. The CC(P) calls upon all the
revolutionary,  democratic, justice and peace-loving people of India to
forcefully oppose the Indian government’s interference into the internal
affairs of Nepal. The CC(P) calls upon the jawans of the Indian army who
hail from the toiling classes, not to involve themselves in killing their class
brethren by participating in the unjust mili-tary campaign of the Indian
government. We call upon the people of South Asia, as well as the entire
world population to rise against and resist the India government’s interference
in the internal affairs of Nepal for protect-ing the medieval rule of King
Gyanendra whose hands are soaked in the blood of thousands of Nepali
people.

Render all Support to the

Ongoing People’s War in Nepal!

Condemn the Fascist Attacks of Gyanendra’s
Military Regime on the Revolutionary Bases

and the People of Nepal!

Revolutionary and Democratic Forces of Nepal!

Unite to Fight US Imperialism, Indian Expansionism

and to Establish Genuine People’s Democracy!

The developments in neighbouring Nepal, starting with the dismissal of
the Sher Bahadur Deuba government and the declaration of a state of
Emergency by King Gyanendra on the 31st of January, are a matter of
grave  concern  to  the  democratic-minded  people  of  the  entire  world,
particularly to the people of South Asia and India. The king had usurped all
powers in an extra-Constitutional manner, suppressed all opposition to his
fascist rule, imposed the worst form of censorship on the media and cut off
all communications of the citizens within Nepal as well as with the outside
world. People of Nepal are today living under the most suffocating conditions.
The military regime is planning to unleash an all-round attack on the
revolutionary bases in Western Nepal and throughout the country through
aerial bombardment, economic blockade, and gory massacres. And these
diabolic  designs  of  tyrant  Gyanendra  are  backed  by  the  imperialists,
particularly  the  US  imperialists,  as  well  as  the  Indian  ruling  classes,
notwithstanding their tall talk of multi-party democracy.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of India (Maoist)
strongly condemns this authoritarian, despotic, tyrannical rule of King
Gyanendra  who  represents  an  outdated  and  archaic  system  of  feudal
monarchy that is entirely opposed to all democratic institutions and the
September 2004 - August 2014  41

democratic aspirations of the vast majority of the masses of Nepal. All
democratic-minded  people  of  India  and  South Asia  should  outrightly
condemn the fascist, draconian measures of the despot of Nepal and should
show their active solidarity with the people of Nepal in their struggle against
Gyanendra’s fascist rule. In fact, the King has the notoriety of dismissing
the governments thrice in the past.

The imposition of Emergency by King Gyanendra is mainly intended
to suppress the revolutionary people’s war led by the Communist Party of
Nepal(Maoist) that is leading a countrywide revolutionary movement by
uniting all the anti-feudal, anti-imperialist forces and all the oppressed
nationalities. The Maoists are fighting for the abolition of the outdated
monarchy and the establishment of a democratic people’s republic in Nepal
in  the  short  run,  and  ultimately,  the  establishment  of  Socialism  and
Communism. The Maoists had already established control over three-quarters
of the rural areas of the country. Fearing an imminent take-over of state
power by the CPN(Maoist), which is the only force that is struggling for
genuine democracy and the only force that is capable of ending the monarchy
and establishing genuine people’s democracy in Nepal, the imperialists led
by the US imperialists, have assured the King of all help and cooperation in
his bloody suppression campaign. The US imperialists are ever ready to
step into Nepal, just as they had done in Iraq and are itching to do in Iran
and Syria, so as to destroy the Maoist revolutionary bases and protect the
rotting reactionary regime. Multi-party democracy will be used as a pretext
for such an intervention. The threat of a Maoist take-over always serves as
a reason for the US imperialists to extend their vicious fangs into Nepal
whoever is in power.

The unhappiness expressed by the Indian expansionist rulers over the
developments in Nepal is only an eye-wash. The Indian ruling classes want
the Nepali rulers to suppress the Maoists in the most ruthless manner but
they  wish  to  do  this  through  the  façade  of  multi-party  parliamentary
democracy just as they themselves had been doing in Kashmir and North
East  by  perpetrating  the  worst  massacres  under  the  garb  of  so-called
democracy. Moreover, the Indian ruling classes want to have their political
control over Nepal, half of whose trade they are already controlling. Deuba

42   Internatioal Messages and Statements

and Koirala are the trusted agents of the Indian ruling classes and quite
naturally the latter are exercising pressure over the King to allow the
“democratically elected” parties to perform their duties.

The Indian ruling classes have been training the Royal Nepalese army
to suppress the Maoists, and have been giving all aid and assistance to the
Nepalese government whoever may be in power. Prevention of a Maoist
take-over in Nepal and destroying their revolutionary bases is the common
objective of all imperialists as well as Indian expansionists. Whatever is
their outward opposition to Gyanendra’s draconian measures, in reality, all
these vultures extend help to Gyanendra in suppressing the Maoists. The
Indian ruling classes have been assisting their Nepali counterparts in their
bloody suppression campaign of the Maoists along the borders by arresting,
extraditing and even killing those who cross into Indian territory or who
take treatment in the Indian hospitals. These operations had been stepped
up after the imposition of the Emergency and Indian security forces had
been deployed in large number along the Indo-Nepal border to prevent the
entry of the Maoist forces into India. Thereby they are helping Gyanendra’s
reactionary army to commit the worst massacres of their people.

Like every fascist ruler, King Gyanendra also wants to have absolute
power by crushing all opposition including a section of the ruling classes.
This foolish move had already isolated the King and is bound to lead to a
polarization of all the forces opposed to the tyrannical rule of the King. And
the Maoists are bound to grow stronger by leading all the forces opposed to
the tyrannical rule. The CPI(Maoist) extends its complete and unequivocal
support to the CPN(Maoist) and the masses of Nepal in their fight against
the tyranny of the King and for the establishment of a people’s democratic
republic of Nepal. It warns the Indian ruling classes to stop intervening in
Nepal and stop assisting the Nepalese ruling classes in suppressing their
campaign against the Maoists. It also demands that the Indian security
forces should put an end to the arrests and harassment of the Nepalis
crossing the border in the wake of the gory massacres by Gyanendra’s
fascist regime.

The CC, CPI(Maoist) calls upon the Party cadre, PLGA fighters, and

September 2004 - August 2014  43

the revolutionary masses of India to organize rallies and demonstrations to
protest the fascist measures in Nepal, demanding the immediate lifting of
the Emergency and putting an end to the suppression campaign against the
Maoists and other democratic forces who are protesting the intervention by
the US imperialists and the Indian ruling classes in whatever manner. It also
calls upon the PLGA fighters to resist by all means the “search and destroy”
operations of the Indian security forces along the border with Nepal.

Condemn the UPA Government’s Plans to Supply Arms to the
Reactionary, Autocratic Gyanendra’s Military Regime in Nepal!
Unite to Fight the Sinister Designs of US Imperialism and Indian

Expansionism to Attack the Revolutionary Bases in Nepal!

The Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, after his meeting with
the autocratic fascist monarch of Nepal, King Gyanendra, on 23rd April in
Indonesia, declared that the Indian government would supply arms and
other ‘aid’ to his barbaric, medieval regime if the “Emergency” is lifted or
relaxed. A clear understanding was arrived at in the meeting between these
two that the King would turn ‘benevolent’ within a short time and permit
some form of democracy in his country.

The entire talk of restoration of democracy in Nepal is the biggest farce
of this century. It is only a figleaf behind which the Indian ruling classes,
the US and other imperialists wish to carry on their most rapacious plunder
and brutal suppression of the Maoists fighting for genuine democracy in
Nepal. In fact, until 31st January, 2005 when the Sher Bahadur Deuba
government was dismissed and a state of Emergency was declared by King
Gyanendra, the expansionist Indian ruling classes had given all types of so-
called aid to the feudal autocratic regime. It trained the Nepali army, supplied
arms and other military needs, sent its military advisors and the personnel
of the notorious Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to Nepal to assist the
decadent crumbling regime in its desperate bid to stall the rising tide of
people’s war led by CPN(Maoist) led by comrade Prachanda.

However, the dismissal of the Deuba government and the declaration
of Emergency had caused grave concern in the minds of the democratic-
minded people of the entire world, particularly to the people of South Asia
and India. The King had usurped all powers in an extra-Constitutional

September 2004 - August 2014  45

manner, suppressed all opposition to his fascist rule, imposed the worst
form of censorship on the media and cut off all communications of the
citizens within Nepal as well as with the outside world. The Indian ruling
classes had no other alternative but to declare suspension of military aid to
the King and exert pressure to ‘restore’ democracy.

Within three months the Indian expansionist rulers have once again
come out openly as the saviours of a tottering, autocratic regime that is
hated by the entire people of Nepal. But for the external support by the
imperialists, particularly the US imperialists, and the Indian and Chinese
expansionists, the medieval regime of King Gyanendra would have had an
ignominious burial by now. Already the CPN(Maoist) and the People’s
Liberation Army led by it, have liberated over three-quarters of the country
where genuine democracy prevails. The revolutionary people’s government
in  this  vast  rural  area  of  Nepal  has  become  a  model  of  self-reliance,
cooperative  and  collective  wonders,  equitable  distribution,  genuine
democracy to the people, and so on. It is this Red Nepal that stands towering
in the midst of the feudal and imperialist stink that sends shivers down the
spines of the reactionaries the world over.

The Indian ruling classes have become even more panicky as a revolution
erupting in its own backyard is bound to have a significant impact on the
situation in India. The ruling classes have begun to propagate day in and
day out about a ‘Red Corridor’ or a compact revolutionary zone (CRZ)
from the revolutionary bases in Nepal to the guerilla zones of Andhra Pradesh
and even upto Kerala. And this fear of the spreading flames of revolution
led by the Maoists from Nepal to South India has made the reactionaries sit
up and unleash massive attacks in both the countries.

People  of  Nepal  have  suffered  and  are  suffering  under  the  most
suffocating conditions. The military regime has unleashed an all-round attack
on the revolutionary bases in Western Nepal and throughout the country
through aerial bombardment, economic blockade, and gory massacres. And
these diabolic designs of tyrant Gyanendra had the covert backing of the
imperialists, particularly the US imperialists, as well as the Indian ruling
classes, notwithstanding their tall talk of multi-party democracy.

To
Association of People’s Democracy in India
Canada

Dear Comrades,

We send you the warmest greetings from our Party and the revolutionary/
democratic masses of India on the formation of the APDI. The formation
of such a body abroad has important significance for the democratic and
anti-imperialist movement of our country. This is particularly important at
such a time when our great country is being pushed to the abyss by the
imperialist gangsters and their Indian agents.

India today is reeling under horrifying hunger, disease and starvation
leading to lakhs of deaths each year, all of which have been aggravated ten-
fold by the ruthless penetration of imperialist globalization. Six decades of
so-called independence have given nothing to the vast oppressed masses of
this country. The liberation of our motherland is still as urgent as it was a
century back.

With a vast expatriate community abroad we are hopeful that the Indian
people there rise to the occasion and lend a hand in this historic task. It is
particularly in this context that we hail the formation of the APDI as an
important first step forward. We are confident that this will grow into a
mighty force encompassing all democratic and patriotic Indians living in
Canada.

The people of Indian origin in Canada have great revolutionary and
patriotic tradition  by their initiation of the Gadar Party and their support
for Naxalbari. It is this revolutionary spirit that is being continued by the
formation of the APDI. We are confident that this will grow from strength
to strength.

September 2004 - August 2014  49

We hope through this formation you are able to propagate and rally the
vast  Indian  masses  of  Canada  in  support  for  the  ongoing  democratic
movement in the country. We are very thankful for the assistance that you
have already lent us in various ways. It is very much appreciated by the
people of this country.

The first task that we would hope for is the wide propagation of the
democratic and revolutionary movement amongst the masses of Canada,
particularly amongst Indians. For this we will send you whatever literature
that is available in both English and Punjabi and in other languages. We will
also send you whatever is available on CDs, films, and in other forms.

One other major point of propagation that we would like to be propagated
is the anti-democratic measures that are being taken by the government on
the democratic and revolutionary movement in the country.  This can be
taken very widely and even amongst legislators of Canada. For example,
the government has incarcerated some of our top leaders, like that of the
PB member Sunil Roy. Though he is elderly and in failing health he has
been kept by the CPM government of Bengal in horrible conditions in the
jail. Also the new Congress government in AP, after conducting the ploy of
talks, have launched a type of brutal killings worse than that of the previous
Naidu government. In these nine months since the break down of talks
they have killed over 100 comrades in fake encounters, some of them
senior leaders. And now, in Chattisgarh the rulers have launched a type of
terror seen only during the British rule. They have been hunting down the
leaders of the tribals and even children activists, severing their heads and
hanging it on trees and on top of their own houses. They are also burning,
looting and destroying their houses on a mass scale. The terror is on a scale
that has not been seen in recent years.

This is all being done quietly with little or no propaganda. We intend to
publicise this widely in India and abroad. We also would like to take the
widest possible campaign to raise money for the families of the affected in
both India and abroad. All the details we will be sending you.

Propagating our literature and taking out a campaign against the brutalities
of  the  Indian  government  which  goes  against  any  civilized  (let  alone
democratic) norms, are two immediate means of assisting the process of

also be taking issues that also affect the local Indian populace in order to
rally the largest possible section of the masses.

Message from the CC (P), CPI(Maoist) on the

Occasion of the 10th Anniversary of the

Initiation of People’s War in Nepal

On behalf of the CC(P), the entire Party rank-and-file, the PLGA, the
organs of people’s power, the varied mass organisations and the revolutionary
masses  of  India  we  send  heartfelt  revolutionary  greetings  to  the  CPN
(Maoist), PLA, URPCs in the Base Areas and the people of Nepal on the
occasion of the 10th Anniversary of initiation of People’s War in Nepal.
The victories achieved in this decade of struggle have been a great inspiration
to our Party and the oppressed masses of the people of India.

In this short time the revolutionary masses of Nepal under the leadership
of the CPN(Maoist) have been able to develop a strong party, powerful
people’s army and a United Front that governs vast areas of the country in
the Base Areas set up. They have successfully been able to isolate the
hated monarchy and have liberated vast parts of the countryside. They
have taken the people’s war from the stage of strategic defence to that of
strategic offence in this short period of time. It is no doubt a historic advance
which inspires not only the revolutionary people of India but that of the
entire  world.  They  have  helped  create  a  new  hope  in  the  communist
movement after the setback in the Soviet Union and China throughout the
world beckoning a new wave of revolutionary struggles in the world.

As a fraternal Party from a neighbouring country, and that too a big
country where the ruling classes have adopted expansionist designs to rob,
loot, interfere and control that country and people, we assure the Nepalese
people we will not rest until we end such interference in the internal affairs
of a small neighbouring country. We strongly condemn the Indian rulers for
arming  the  RNA  to  suppress  the  people’s  movement. We  call  for  the
scrapping of all unequal treaties with Nepal and the removal of all Indian

52   Internatioal Messages and Statements

comprador  business  interests  from  Nepal. We  are  for  building  good
neighbourly relations between the two countries on the basis of total equality,
no matter what the size of the countries may be — based on the five
principles  of  peaceful  co-existence. Also,  in  the  spirit  of  proletarian
internationalism we lend full support to the ongoing people’s movement in
Nepal; and call on the people of the entire world to help in all ways to make
the Nepal revolution a success.

The people of Nepal and India have long and deep cultural, social,
economic and political relations. The two Maoist parties are further bound
by a common ideological basis of the world proletariat, i.e., Marxism-
Leninism-Maoism and a common goal, i.e., establishment of socialism and
communism on the entire world. Both are fired by the spirit of proleta-rian
internationalism. There is therefore no force that can break this strong
unity that is developing in the course of the class struggle in our respective
countries. We shall build solid bonds of unity against imperialism and Indian
expansionism. We shall always stand by revolutionary people of Nepal in
their time of need and will vehemently oppose any form of intervention by
the Indian rulers or imperialists against the revolutionary  movement of
Nepal. We will give whatever support necessary to safeguard the great
victories of the Nepalese revolution.

Once again on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the initiation of
the people’s war in Nepal we send our warmest revolu-tionary greetings to
the CPN(Maoist), PLA, URPCs at various level in all the Base Areas and
the revolutionary masses. We also pay our sincere homage to the thousands
of heroic fighters and commanders of PLA, the members and leaders of
CPN(Maoist) and people who have given their precious lives for the liberation
of their country and for the great cause of establishment of Socialism-
Communism in the entire human society.

Racist Cartoons against Prophet Mohammed are
A Deliberate Conspiracy of the Imperialists to

Denigrate the Muslim Community!

The So-called Crusaders of Free Press are

Only Apologists of Neo-colonialism!!

The Central committee, CPI (Maoist), condemns the publication of the
racist cartoons caricaturing the holy symbol of the Muslim community -
Prophet Mohammed - by the Western media which is nothing but a sinister
design  of  the  imperialists  led  by  George  Bush  to  create  a  so-called
civilisational clash between what they portray as “archaic and medieval”
Muslim  culture  and  “Western  values”  that  are  supposed  to  promote
democracy.

The publication of the racist cartoons caricaturing Prophet Mohammed,
first by Jyllands-Posten of Denmark, and later by several papers in the
West, is neither accidental nor has any relation to so-called freedom of
speech and free press. It is not just the Right-wing section of the media and
the rulers that have been chanting the mantra of freedom of speech but
even the Liberals and some civil liberties activists of the West too joined the
chorus overlooking the sinister designs of the imperialists.

The popular fury that is vent out on the streets across the world by the
Muslim masses is not just the result of the cartoons though  it  served  as  a
flash  point. Imperialism led by the 21st  century Hitler, George  Bush,  has
been  demonizing  the Muslim  symbols;  launching  wars  of aggression  on
Islamic  countries  as  in Afghanistan  and  Iraq;  threatening  to invade or
destroy Iran, Syria, Libya etc.; and  endorsing  every  act  of  terrorism
perpetrated by the Israeli Zionist racist regime on the Palestinians and other
Arab countries. The heartrending agony suffered by  the  Muslims  ever
since  the  brutal campaign  unleashed  by  the  imperialist marauders led by

54   Internatioal Messages and Statements

George Bush in the name of a permanent and global war against terror,
using the 9/11 incidents as a pretext, is indescribable.  The  savage  bombings,
indiscriminate  arrests,  blood-chilling torture of the detainees, as revealed
by the horrifying  photos  and  videos  of  Abu Ghraib; the denial of legal
and human rights to Muslim prisoners held without trial for almost five
years by the criminal Bush administration in the concentration camp in
Guantanamo  Bay  and  the  terrible conditions prevalent there as revealed
by  the  latest  report  of  the  UN  Commission  on  Human  Rights  which
recommended its immediate closure; the repeated humiliation of the Muslim
citizens through surveillance and interrogation in the US and European
countries; derogatory acts such as trampling upon and even urinating upon
the Muslim holy book of Koran; the portrayal of Muslims as villains and
barbarians by numerous films, novels and the Western media; and several
such racist acts have made the Muslims furious and alienated. No wonder,
more and more Muslims are pushed into the fold of religious fundamentalism
and are willingly volunteering to join the so-called terrorists thanks to the
global terror unleashed by George Bush.

Thus it is due to such historical and cultural factors, that the racist
cartoons became the focal point for letting out the anger, disgust and agony
felt by hundreds of millions of Muslims against the violence, oppression
and exploitation perpetrated by the imperialists and their global corporations
in their insatiable thirst for oil, rubber, diamonds and super profits.

The  western  media  continues  to  sprinkle  salt  on  the  wound  by
republishing the controversial racist cartoons of the Danish press in several
newspapers in France, Germany, the US, Australia and so on. The so-
called liberals and advocates of free speech and free press maintain a criminal
silence at the repulsive, repugnant, brutal tortures inflicted by the mercenaries
of Bush, Blair and Co in Abu Ghraib, Bagram, Guantanamo Bay, and in
numerous concentration camps maintained by the US and its allies in Iraq,

tears shed for the victims of such abuse and violence perpetrated by the
world’s so-called democracies. The horrifying, blood-chilling photographs
and videos from Abu Ghraib that would put even a Hitler to shame draw no
protests or condemnation of the perpetrators of these crimes seated in the
White Hose and Downing Street. Why wouldn’t these self- styled champions
of fundamental rights speak of the fundamental rights of prisoners in the
torture chambers of Abu Ghraib and elsewhere? It is clear that the so-called
freedom of speech and press is a sham and what these hypocrites and
frauds, masked as liberals and democrats, mean is freedom for publishing
overtly racist, anti-Muslim, provocative and derogatory literature while
censoring the inhuman, savage and criminal deeds of imperialism led by
butcher Bush.

The ruling regime in Denmark led by the Centre-Right coalition of
Rasmussen, has racist constituents such as the rabidly anti-Islamic and
anti-immigrant Danish People’s Party and the Conservative People’s Party.
Obviously, it has allowed the publication of the cartoons with malafide
intent to make the Muslims the scapegoats for the ills of Danish society and
to tighten the immigration laws to prevent the flow of more people from the
Muslim world into their country. In fact, Rasmussen’s coalition came to
power with the slogan of tax freeze and strict restrictions on immigration.
The racist face of this supposedly liberal regime in Denmark can also be
seen from the fact that it has denied the Muslims the right to build mosques
in Copenhagen or cemeteries in Denmark. It is with the same intent of
whipping up anti- Muslim passions and thereby divert the people from the
real issues confronting them that the ruling regimes in other imperialist
countries too allowed the republication of the cartoons.

George Bush, as expected, defended the publication of the cartoons in
the name of free a press. This international terrorist who cares a damn for
international public opinion, rejects the Geneva Convention as inapplicable
to his soldiers found guilty of the worst war crimes in history, maintains
prisoners without trial for years without end, derives vicarious pleasure as
his mercenaries inflict cruel torture on hapless prisoners, considers the UN
Commission’s report regarding the conditions of 500-odd prisoners in the
hell-hole of Guantanamo Bay as unacceptable, has become a crusa-der of
freedom of expression and free press!!

CPI(Maoist) Strongly Condemns the

Imposition of Emergency in the Philippines

1-3-2006

The  Communist  Party  of  India  (Maoist)  strongly  condemns  the
imposition of Emergency in the Philippines by the US puppet government
of President Arroyo. The government banned the rallies to be held on the
20th anniversary of the ‘people’s power’ and had arrested military officers,
opposition leaders and have closed down all anti-Arroyo newspaper offices.
More details are yet to come to light.

There has been months of mass unrest against the anti-people polices
of the Arroyo government involving a large section of the people of the
Philippines stretching from the parliamentary opposition at one end to the
revolutionary forces of the country, including the National Democratic Front
of Philippines (NDFP). This government acting as a stooge of the US has
been systematically selling out the country to the imperialists and has even
gone to the extent of inviting the US armed forces into the country. It has
been bogged down in all sorts of corruption.

Not only that even before the declaration of Emergency the government
has been using vigilante forces to assassinate leaders of mass organisations
and the trade unions. Over the last year or two about 50 of such leaders
have been murdered by these killer forces. They have also been ruthlessly
using the military against the peoples forces led by the Communist Party of
the Philippines (CPP) and even against Moro nationality movement. In a
recent action 16 Maoists were brutally killed by the military forces.

Our Party strongly condemns these actions and fully stands with the
oppressed masses of the Philippines. The people of India stand shoulder to
shoulder with the people of the Philippines in their struggle for justice,
democracy and socialism. We demand the immediate lifting of the Emergency
in the Philippines and strong punishment for those responsible for the

assassination of the leaders of the mass organisations. The struggle of the
people of the Philippines is part of our common struggle against the common
enemy of imperialism, particularly US imperialism. The people of India
firmly unite with the people of the Philippines against their reactionary
rulers.

Condemn the Death Sentence on Saddam Hussein

by the US Occupiers and their Puppet Regime in Iraq!
George Bush - the No.1 Perpetrator of Crimes against

Humanity - should be Hanged, not Saddam!!

On November 5th, the US occupiers and their puppet regime in Iraq
had completed their farce of so-called judicial enquiry into Saddam Hussein’s
crimes when he was the head of state of Iraq and sentenced him to death
on charges of his alleged role in the killing of 148 people in the Shia village
of Dujail in 1982. Two others, a former military intelligence chief and a
chief judge, too were sentenced to death while several others were given
rigorous imprisonments. The timing of the judgement, coming as it is on
the eve of the Congressional elections in the US, shows the deep-rooted
conspiracy and the ulterior motives of the Bush administration. Having lost
its credibility among the American people who had begun to question their
government’s continued occupation of Iraq and the debacles its occupation
forces are facing, the Bush administration has used the death sentence as a
bait to woo the voters.

The sentences have no validity under any count as the entire judicial
process had taken place under the direction of the US occupiers, three
lawyers defending Saddam were brutally assassinated, two judges were
changed and puppet officials were appointed as judges of the fake Tribunal.
It is only the people of a country who have the right to punish its rulers and
this can happen only after the US occupiers quit Iraq. Through this verdict,
the Bush administration had also aimed at furthering the divide between the
Shias and Kurds on the one side and the Sunnis on the other. It is unfortunate
that Shia Muslims should hail the judgement that will benefit only the US
occupiers. The Shia people have the right to punish Saddam but the first
and foremost task before them is to throw out the US occupation forces
from the soil of Iraq, build a sovereign Iraq and then to hold trial of all those
responsible for killing innocent people.
60   Internatioal Messages and Statements

If the killing of 148 people can be cited as an example for awarding
death sentence, then how many times Bush should be hanged for killing
over 6,50,000 civilians in Iraq since his invasion of that country in March
2003? And for his sadistic brutalities in Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay and
elsewhere? Virtually every US President at least since WWII could be hanged
to death for the countless crimes they had committed in Vietnam, Laos,
Cambodia, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Dominican Republic,
the Congo, Somalia and several other Third World countries. Killings in
Dujail pale into insignificance before a My Lai massacre in Vietnam. And
the daily bombardment of civilian localities by the Israeli Zionist forces in
Gaza, West Bank and other Palestinian territories, usage of weapons of
mass destruction on Lebanese territory and the genocide of the Palestinian
people are the fittest case for sending Israeli dictators like Ariel Sharon to
the gallows.

The war on Iraq is not for preventing Saddam from using the non-
existent WMD but to grab its rich oil resources for satisfying the insatiable
greed of the oil lobby and the military-industrial complex that Bush basically
represents. People of Iraq—Sunnis, Shias, Kurds—should join ranks to
throw out the foreign imperialist forces occupying their country. They should
resolve their differences and reject the judgements delivered under colonial
rulers. Acceptance  of  the  US-dictated  judgments  would  only  mean
legitimizing the colonial rule imposed by the US-British imperialists on the
people of Iraq.

We call upon the people of India to condemn this fake verdict fabricated
by the US imperialists led by George Bush and other imperialists. We call
upon all sections of Indian people to condemn the ambiguous attitude of
the UPA government which, in essence, means tacit support for the death
sentence and US occupation. Let us unequivocally declare that no foreign
power has the right to interfere in the judicial process of any country and
that the death sentence on Saddam and others imposed by the imperialists
is null and void in the eyes of the world people. Let us demand and fight for
the hanging of Bush, Blair and other imperialists for their indescribable
crimes against humanity, not sparing even children and old people.

A New Nepal can Emerge Only by
Smashing the Reactionary State!

Depositing Arms of the PLA under UN Supervision

would Lead to the Disarming of the Masses!!

On 5th November the CPN (Maoist) had entered into an agreement
with the government of Nepal which stipulated that the PLA would deposit
its arms in seven designated cantonments while the government’s armed
forces too would deposit an equal number of arms. These would be placed
under the supervision of a UN monitoring team while the keys of the lockers
of PLA arms would be with the Maoist party. It was also agreed by both
sides to dissolve the present Parliament and form a new interim Parliament
with a share of the seats for the Maoists, to form an interim government
with some portfolios for the Maoists, and to elect a Constituent Assembly
by next summer which is supposed to decide the fate of the monarchy and
the future of Nepal. The agreement received the final official stamp when
prime minister Koirala and chairman of CPN(M) comrade Prachanda signed
the  agreement  and  declared  it  publicly. The  CC,  CPI(Maoist)  has  been
perturbed by this agreement concluded by the fraternal Maoist party in
Nepal with the government of the seven party alliance led by the Indian
protégé Koirala.

The agreement to deposit the arms of the people’s army in designated
cantonments is fraught with dangerous implications. This act could lead to the
disarming of the oppressed masses of Nepal and to a reversal of the gains made
by the people of Nepal in the decade-long people’s war at the cost of immense
sacrifices. The clause in the agreement to deposit an equal number of arms by
both sides will obviously work in favour of the Koirala-led government as the
latter will have the option to use the huge stock of arms still at the disposal of
the army anytime and to further strengthen the reactionary army of the
government. The decision taken by CPN(Maoist) on arms management, even
if it thinks it is a tactical step to achieve its immediate goal of setting up a
constituent assembly, is harmful to the interests of the revolution.
62   Internatioal Messages and Statements

Entire experiences of the world revolution had demonstrated time and
again that without the people’s army it is impossible for the people to exercise
their power. Nothing is more dreadful to imperialism and the reactionaries
than armed masses and hence they would gladly enter into any agreement
to disarm them. In fact, disarming the masses has been the constant refrain
of all the reactionary ruling classes ever since the emergence of class-divided
society.  Unarmed  masses  are  easy  prey  for  the  reactionary  classes  and
imperialists  who  even  enact  massacres  as  proved  by  history. The  CC,
CPI(Maoist), as one of the detachments of world proletariat, warns the
CPN(Maoist) and the people of Nepal of the grave danger inherent in the
agreement  to  deposit  the  arms  and  calls  upon  them  to  reconsider  their
tactics in the light of bitter historical experiences.

The agreement by the Maoists to become part of the interim government
in Nepal cannot transform the reactionary character of the state machinery
that serves the exploiting ruling classes and imperialists. The state can be
the instrument in the hands of either the exploiting classes or the proletariat
but it cannot serve the interests of both these bitterly-contending classes. It
is the fundamental tenet of Marxism that no basic change in the social
system can be brought about without smashing the state machine. Reforms
from above cannot bring any qualitative change in the exploitative social
system however democratic the new Constitution might seem to be, and
even if the Maoists become an important component of the government. It
is sheer illusion to think that a new Nepal can be built without smashing the
existing state.

Another illusion that the agreement creates is regarding the so-called
impartial or neutral role of the UN. The UN is in reality an instrument in the
hands of the imperialists, particularly US imperialists, to dominate, bully
and interfere in the affairs of the Third World countries for the benefit of
the imperialists. It is used as a guise to provide legitimacy to the brazen acts
of the imperialists to oppress and suppress the people of the Third World.
Afghanistan and Iraq are the most recent instances of UN’s direct role in
legitimizing imperialist aggression and occupation of these countries. It is
the duty of the revolutionaries to expose, oppose and fight this imperialist
role of the UN. Giving it any role in arms management, election supervision,
and peace process in Nepal, would only mean inviting imperialist interference,
in particular that of US imperialism.

September 2004 - August 2014  63

Another disturbing factor is the illusion harboured by the Maoists in
Nepal regarding the role of the Indian expansionists. Indian ruling classes
are the biggest threat to the people of the entire sub-continent and it is the
duty of the people of the various countries of South Asia to unitedly fight
Indian expansionism. The Indian state, with the backing of US imperialism,
has been continuously interfering in the internal affairs of Nepal; it had
backed the monarchy while encouraging its stooges among the parliamentary
forces in the name of two-pillar theory; trained and extended all forms of
aid to the Royal Nepal Army in their military offensive against the Maoists;
has secret deals with the Nepali Congress led by Koirala and with other
reactionary parties; and is bent upon disarming the PLA and the masses of
Nepal and isolating the Maoists. Its aim is to grab the natural wealth of
Nepal particularly its huge hydel potential and to make it a safe haven for
the imperialists and Indian comprador capitalists. Comrade Prachanda’s
repeated praise for India’s role in bringing about the agreement between
the Maoists and the SPA in Nepal creates illusions among the masses about
India rather than preparing them for fighting the Indian expansionists who
are keen on Skirmishing Nepal in future.

Even more surprising is the assertion by the CPN(Maoist) that their
current “tactics” in Nepal would be an example to other Maoist parties in
South Asia.  Comrade  Prachanda  had  also  given  a  call  to  other  Maoist
parties to reconsider their revolutionary strategies and to practice multiparty
democracy  in  the  name  of  21st  century  democracy.  Our  CC  makes  it
crystal-clear to CPN(M) and the people at large that there can be no genuine
democracy  in  any  country  without  the  capture  of  state  power  by  the
proletariat and that the so-called multiparty democracy cannot bring any
basic change in the lives of the people. It calls upon the Maoist parties and
people of South Asia to persist in the path of protracted people’s war as
shown by comrade Mao. We also appeal to the CPN(Maoist) once again to
rethink about their current tactics which are actually changing the very
strategic direction of the revolution in Nepal and to withdraw from their
agreement with the government of Nepal on depositing arms of PLA as
this would make the people defenseless in face of attacks by the reactionaries.

Letter from Unity Congress-9th Congress for Indians Abroad

To
Dear Comrades,

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India

(Maoist) we send you our Revolutionary Greetings.

 We take this opportunity to inform you of the successful completion
of  the  historic  Unity  Congress-9th  Congress  of  the  CPI(Maoist).  The
Congress that took place in the months of January-February 2007 within
one of the Guerilla Zones in India, was the culmination of a 2-year process
initiated on Sept 20 2004 with the merger of the two Maoist streams of the
Indian revolution into the CPI(Maoist). On this historic day the CCs of the
MCCI  and  the  CPI(ML)(PW)  merged  on  the  basis  of  5  draft  basic
documents, draft Political & Organisational Reviews and serious self-
criticisms over the period of the clashes.

Over these past two years these draft documents were translated into
nine Indian languages and taken throughout the Party. Initially classes were
taken on these documents together with discussions on its various points.
Then, from early 2006, began the Congress process with area Conferences
being held, followed by District Conferences and then the State Conferences.
At all these Conferences the basic documents were adopted and amendments
sent to the Congress. Each Conference also reviewed their past practice
and elected new committees after a process of criticism and self-criticism
of the respective out-going committees. The State Conferences also elected
the delegates to the Congress, just as the lower Conferences elected delegates
to the District and State Conferences. The number of delegates was based
on proportional representation depending on the size of the Party membership
at the various levels.

September 2004 - August 2014  65

After much debate and the inclusion of a large number of amendments
the Unity Congress-9th Congress finally also adopted the basic documents
on Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, the Party Programme, Party Constitution,
Strategy & Tactics of Indian Revolution, and the Political Resolution (i.e an
analysis of the current international and domestic situation). Major debates
that remained in the merger process were also discussed throughout the
party and finally clinched at the Congress through discussion and voting.
Both the erstwhile parties presented their Political and Organisational Reviews
of their over 3-decades past practice at the Congress and these too were
adopted with amendments. Then the past two-year Review of the merged
Party was also discussed and adopted with amendments. Then the Congress
also passed a number of resolutions on current events, and also resolutions
on the question of building of the Party, People’s Army and the United
Front. Finally the outgoing CC presented its collective self-criticisms and
invited criticism from the delegates. After this, the outgoing CC presented a
panel for the new CC which was unanimously elected. The CC then re-
elected com Ganapathi as the general secretary of the Party.

The Unity Congress-9th Congress set as its central task the advancing
of the people’s war to set up Base Areas, and, in the process, turning
guerrilla war into mobile war and the PLGA into the PLA. It also took up
the tasks of further deepening the Party amongst the basic masses and
building the United Front. Though most of the Maoist forces in the country
have merged into the united Party, it took the task to unite with those
Maoists not yet in the Party, on the basis of the documents now finalized.
We will later be sending you copies of all our basic documents and also
the resolutions passed. We do hope you will go through it and send us your
critical views. Though the process of the Congress has been going on for
two years we were not able to inform you about the Congress process due
to the approach of the Indian rulers who were hell-bent on foiling this
Congress, and had even set up a separate cell at the Centre to coordinate
intelligence inputs on the Congress. They even estimated the rough dates of
the Congress resorting to extensive surveillance of all our GZs. Later, we
will give you a more detailed report and would like to also discuss any point
that you may have on our documents. We welcome critical comments.

The Unity Congress-9th Congress of the CPI(Maoist) is of great historical
significance for the Indian revolution for three reasons. First, it has further
cemented the unity between the two erstwhile Maoist streams in the country.
Second, it was the first Congress of an all-India united Party to be held
after the 8th Congress of the CPI(ML) was held in 1970 — i.e. after a gap
of over 3½ decades.  And third, it refined the line of the two erstwhile
parties, drawing on the positive experiences of both. Through an extensive
process of debate and synthesis we were able to evolve a higher level of
unity.

The Unity Congress-9th Congress re-affirmed the ideological basis of
the Party as Marxism-Leninism-Maoism; the path of Indian revolution as
that of protracted people’s war; the stage of revolution as that of New
Democratic Revolution; and the nature of Indian Society as semi-colonial
and semi-feudal. After extensive debate it further refined our understanding
on the questions of Dual Power, Guerrilla Zone, Guerrilla Base and Base
Area and the inter-relation between these, specifically in the Indian context.
It emphasised the importance of developing to a far greater extent all the
three magic weapons of the revolution. It emphasised the need to extend
the influence of the Party in the urban areas, particularly amongst the working
class. It also analysed the changes that have taken place in the agrarian
relations in Punjab, within the semi-feudal framework. It characterised the
specific nature of Indian feudalism/semi-feudalism as being different from
that  in  Europe  being  deeply  interwoven  with  the  caste  structure  and
Brahminical ideology. It also analysed the reasons for the temporary setback
in the AP movement and the ways of coming out of it. Many other issues
were also settled by thorough discussion, debate and a process of taking the
majority opinion.

Finally, it emphasised the importance of firmly standing by proletarian
internationalism, building closer relations with all the genuine Maoist parties
in the world. It pin-pointed that revisionism continues to be the main danger
to the genuine revolutionary forces the world over. It resolved to actively
intervene in the debates taking place by Maoist forces in the world. It also
vowed to closely ally with all anti-imperialist forces the world over to forge
a firm alliance against imperialism, particularly US imperialism.

PEOPLE’S MARCH: VOICE OF INDIAN REVOLUTION
October 2007

Strongly Condemn Raids on NDFP Leaders and the
Illegal Detention of Com. Sison in the Netherlands

On the morning of August 28, Dutch plainclothes police raided the
home of exiled Filipino revolutionary leader Jose Maria Sison in Utrecht,
the Netherlands, arrested him and charged him with ordering the murder of
two persons in the Philippines in 2003. According to his wife, they broke
down the front door without bothering to ring or knock, bruising her arm as
they prevented her from making a phone call. They carted away computers,
documents, CDs, and other files, remaining until the evening while she was
instructed to sit in a corner.

Eight other locations were simultaneously raided. Sison was not at home
the time. Luis Jalandoni, the chief peace negotiator for the Filipino Maoist
rebels in their talks with the Government of the Philippines, details what
happened:

“The Dutch Police called up Prof. Sison to invite him to the police
station because according to them there were new developments on the
complaint that Prof. Sison had filed in 2001. Thinking that it was about the
complaint he filed on an assassination plot that was hatched by the then
incumbent [Joseph] Estrada government against him, Prof. Sison brought
with him some documents pertinent to the said complaint.”

“But when he arrived at the police station, he was separated from his
three companions that included his lawyer. They learned later that Prof.
Sison had been whisked away to a jail complex in Scheveningen, formerly
used by the Nazis for detaining Dutch resistance fighters, on the patently
spurious charge of ordering the murder of [Arturo] Kintanar and [Romulo]
Tabara.”

A source however said Sison’s house was also subjected to a search by
Dutch authorities. The source also said the houses of National Democratic

72   Internatioal Messages and Statements

Front (NDF) negotiating panel head Luis Jalandoni and Ruth de Leon,
executive director of NDF international information office were searched
by Dutch authorities. Computers and files were reportedly taken.

Sison was in the National Penitentiary in Scheveningen in The Hague
where the judge before whom he appeared August 31 ruled that he will
remain in solitary confinement for up to 14 days. According to his lawyer,
Jan Fermon, the official charge against him is “incitement to murders” in
the Philippines. Its proximate cause, according to the Philippines mainstream
press, was affidavits filed with the Philippines Department of Justice last
year by the wives of Kintanar and Tabara (themselves former communists
expelled from the movement) followed by visits to the Dutch Embassy in
Manila.

Ironically the NDFP consultant’s arrest comes shortly after the Supreme
Court’s dismissal of trumped-up rebellion charges against him and several
other  personalities  in  connection  with  the  2006  alleged  “Left-  Right
conspiracy” to unseat the Arroyo administration. It also comes just barely
over a month after the Luxembourg-based European Court of First Instance
annulled Sison’s inclusion in the Council of the European Union’s “terrorist
list” for lack of basis. In 2002, the CPP-NPA was included by the U.S.
Department of State in its list of “foreign terrorist organizations.” Sison was
likewise listed as a “foreign terrorist.” The Council of the European Union
followed suit later that year. On May 29, the Council of the European
Union decided to retain Sison in its “terrorist” list. This decision was annulled
by the July 11 verdict of the ECFI.

Today com Sison is a consultant to the NDFP and is the Chairperson of
the ILPS (International League of People’s Struggle). It is reported that he
has no direct involvement in the Communist party of the Philippines which
conducted the actions on the two traitors who were collaborating with the
fascist Philippines government. Tabara, according to the Maoists, was
apprehended by CPP officials in a parking lot on Sept. 26, 2004. He pulled
a gun when they attempted to arrest him for murdering an elderly peasant
leader and they shot him to death. This happened in a society in which the
regime in power employs death squads. The human rights group Karapatan
states that more than 800 left-wing activists have been extra-judicially killed
since 2001. The Bush administration makes no fuss about that, or the fact
September 2004 - August 2014  73

that there were 1200 people on death row in the Philippines in June 2006
when the Philippines Congress passed a law banning the death penalty. The
official justice system in the Philippines is widely perceived as fraudulent.
But the U.S. and its allies validate it while treating the people’s courts as
illegitimate and tools of terrorists answering to Sison in his Utrecht exile.

Sison has lived in Holland since 1987. The 68-year-old former professor
of English literature and accomplished poet headed the newly reestablished
Communist Party of the Philippines from 1968 to 1977. Sison has been on
self-exile in the Netherlands since 1987. He had applied for but has not
been granted political asylum. He could not be deported because he has
claimed his life would be endangered upon his arrival in the Philippines.

During these years the party’s military arm, the New People’s Army
(NPA), made extraordinary advances in its People’s War to topple the U.S.-
backed dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. Captured by Marcos’ troops in
1977, Sison spent years in prison, including a year and a half strapped to a
cot, in solitary confinement before he was released in 1986 by President
Corazon Aquino following the “People Power” revolution that drove Marcos
and his notorious wife Imelda out of the country. Since then he has served
as chairman of the International League of Peoples Struggle, and Chief
Political Consultant to the National Democratic Front of the Philippines in
its off-again on-again peace talks with the Manila government. Protests
have broken out all over the world against the illegal detention of Sison by
the Dutch government at the instigation of the US administration.On Aug
29th about a hundred activists belonging to various organizations under the
banner of the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan or New Patriotic
Alliance) rallied here earlier today to protest the arrest of National Democratic
Front of the Philippines (NDFP) chief political consultant and International
League of Peoples’ Struggle (ILPS) chairman Jose Maria Sison in Utrecht,
The Netherlands.

Meanwhile Dutch and Filipino supporters are organizing a petition
campaign. Hastily arranged demonstrations have occurred in the Philippines,
Netherlands, U.S. (New York and L.A.) and Hong Kong. Former U.S.
Attorney General Ramsey Clark has offered his services as an attorney,
describing Sison as “a gentle person... and inspiring leader” and “great

74   Internatioal Messages and Statements

man.” “Everyone who is concerned about peace and freedom has to be
greatly distressed over the arrest of Joma Sison,” he told members of the
New York Committee for Human Rights in the Philippines last week. “Sison
is a great spirit that the world needs to know about, a great voice that the
world needs to hear. The demonization will destroy us if we permit it to
continue.”

The National Lawyer’s Guild of the USA has taken up his case. The
National Lawyers Guild, founded in 1937, is a progressive bar association
in the United States working in the service of the people. Its national office
is headquartered in New York and it has chapters in nearly every state, as
well as over 100 law school chapters. In 2006, NLG lawyers participated in
a delegation of women lawyers to the Philippines, which produced the
report of atrocities.

People’s March demands the immediate and Unconditional release of
Co. Sison and serious action against The Netherlands government for such
acts of harassment. We call on all progressives in the country to build up a
movement for the release of com. Sison. We call on the people of the
country to boycott the purchase of all commodities by Dutch companies
like Unilever (earlier Hindustan Lever), Philips, etc.

The Verdict in Nepal is A Verdict against Feudal

Monarchy, Indian Expansionism and US Imperialism;
It Reflects the Growing Aspirations of the Nepalese

Masses for Land, Livelihood and Democracy!

Oppose the Moves of the Imperialists, Particularly
US Imperialists, and the Indian Expansionists to

Meddle in the Affairs of Nepal!!

The election results in Nepal have proved once again the overwhelming
anger of the masses against the outdated feudal monarchic rule in Nepal,
against the Indian expansionist’s bullying and domination of Nepal, against
US  domination  and  oppression,  and  are  a  reflection  of  the  growing
aspirations of the Nepali masses for democracy, land, livelihood and genuine
freedom from imperialist and feudal exploitation. It is these aspirations of
the overwhelming majority of the masses that had completely trounced the
parties that had either supported the King and/or the Indian ruling classes or
hesitated to come out strongly against feudal, imperialist oppression and
Indian intervention in Nepal. Hence, when an alternative like the CPN(M)
came to the fore, with its open commitment to abolish the feudal monarchy
once for all, abrogate all unequal treaties signed with India by the former
ruling classes of Nepal, and ensure democracy and equality for the oppressed
sections of society such as Dalits, adivasis, national minorities and women,
the  masses  enthusiastically  veered  towards  the  Maoists.  The  CC,
CPI(Maoist), hails the Nepali masses for routing the feudal, pro-imperialist,
pro-Indian comprador parties and voting for a genuine change in the rotten
feudal system in Nepal. It sends its fraternal revolutionary greetings for
their victory in the electoral struggle against the reactionary forces.

The election results have not only sounded the death-knell for the 239-
year-old  absolutist  monarchy  but  also  to  the  continuous  domination,

76   Internatioal Messages and Statements

interference, and bullying by the Indian reactionary expansionist ruling
classes. Moreover, they have also sealed the fate of all the comprador-
feudal electoral Parties which had proved themselves to be the most corrupt,
country-selling, anti-people, loyal stooges of imperialists, feudal forces and
Indian expansionists. In the eyes of the broad masses, these parties are
narrow self-seeking robber gangsters who are out to fatten themselves at
the expense of the vast masses of poor and the destitute. The results are a
telling indictment against forces which had proved themselves to be a party
to the oppression, suppression and exploitation of women, dalits, national
minorities and adivasis.

The real test, however, begins now after the CPN(M) taking over the
reins  of  power.  It  is  a  fundamental  tenet  of  Marxism  that  no  radical
restructuring of the system is possible without the militant mobilization of
the vast masses. It is impossible to make genuine changes in the system
through measures initiated “from above”, i.e. through state decrees and
laws. Whichever Party may be in power, not excluding the most radical
Maoists, one can only make laws at best, but to implement these it is
imperative  to  mobilize  the  masses  and  advance  class  struggle  against
exploiters and oppressors and for radical changes for the liberation of the
vast majority of the poor. No ruling class will give up power without putting
up a bitter struggle and carrying out sabotage and subterfuge against the
oppressed class. Hence the real, bitter and most cruel struggle for power
will now unfold soon after the elections. In fact, drafting Nepal’s Constitution
in favour of the poor and oppressed masses is itself a very arduous and
bitter struggle. The reactionaries will oppose every change tooth and nail.
Lacking  a  majority  in  the  Constituent Assembly,  the  Maoists  will  be
powerless to affect radical changes in the Constitution. Either they have to
compromise and adjust with a section of the reactionary forces thereby
sacrificing the class interests of the oppressed in whose interests they had
come to power, or, they have to mobilize the people and intensify the
struggle  through  all  means,  including  armed  insurrection,  in  order  to
implement genuine democracy and establish people’s power. There is no
other alternative.

September 2004 - August 2014  77

The  CC,  CPI(Maoist),  warns  the  CPN(Maoist)  to  beware  of  the
conspiracies of the imperialists led by the US imperialists, the Indian
reactionary ruling classes, and the feudal comprador forces of Nepal to
engineer coups, political assassinations, creation of artificial scarcity through
economic blockades and sabotage, and subversion of democratic process,
and calls upon it to be fully prepared to confront these reactionaries by
armed means. The one and only guarantee for carrying through the radical
revolutionary programme is to raise the political class consciousness of the
vast masses, mobilize them into class struggle, arm and train them to fight
the exploiters and all reactionary forces and defend the gains they had
derived through long period of class and mass struggle. Nothing could be
more dangerous at the present juncture than to become dizzy with success
and underestimate the prospects of a reactionary backlash. One must keep
in mind that the gains that can be achieved through a government that has
come to power by means of elections are very much limited. Survival of
such a regime depends on taking a conciliatory stand on several crucial
matters. Hence to overestimate the prospects of radical restructuring of the
society or economy by a Maoist government would be illusory and will
dilute the possibility as well as the ability of the Party to continue the class
struggle.

The CC, CPI(Maoist) sees immense possibilities in present-day Nepal
to carry forward the revolutionary programme by firmly relying on the
masses and carrying out class struggle while utilizing the state to further this
process. This is possible if the main leadership of the Maoist party does not
become part of the government but concentrates on the principal task of
continuing the class struggle by mobilizing the masses. Otherwise there is
every danger of unprincipled compromises with the reactionary parties and
imperialists, degeneration of the party leadership and cadres, and emergence
of strong bureaucratic class.  In such a scenario, all the gains made would
go down the drain and the reactionary parties would once again come to
power by cashing in on the frustration of the masses.

Condemn the Brutal Murder of

Comrade Tutul by Bangladesh RAB

It was with great shock and deep sorrow that we heard the news of the
brutal and savage murder of our beloved comrade Mizanur Rahman Tutul,
General Secretary of the Purba Bangla Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist)
Lal Pataka and a founding member of CCOMPOSA. He was killed in a
fake encounter (termed ‘killed in crossfire’ in Bangladesh) in late July 2008
by the notorious Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) of Bangladesh.

The Central Committee of the CPI(Maoist), the PLGA and the entire
rank-and file of the Party conveys its revolutionary condolence in this hour
of serious loss to the CC and entire ranks of the Purba Bangla Communist
Party (Marxist-Leninist) Lal Pataka of Bangladesh. As a fraternal party and
co-member of the CCOMPOSA the loss to the Purba Bangla Communist
Party (Marxist-Leninist) Lal Pataka is like a loss to our Party. We are fully
with them in this hour of serious loss, particularly as it has come soon after
the loss of their main ideological leader and guide, Com Kamrul Islam
(Master).

Comrade Tutul  was  a  leading  figure  in  the  Maoist  movement  of
Bangladesh. In 1997, along with comrade Kamrul Islam (Master) he founded
the Purba Bangla Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) Lal Pataka. Comrade
Kamrul was martyred in 2006, murdered while in the custody of the RAB.
Comrade Tutul played a leading role in initiating a thorough summation
of the rich history and experiences of the Party and of the Maoist movement
in Bangladesh. He was keen on unifying the genuine Maoist forces of that
country into a single party. He was an active participant in CCOMPOSA
and had close relations with the CPI (Maoist). We shared experiences and
sought to learn from each other’s practice. His death, coming in the wake
of the loss of comrade Kamrul, is a heavy blow for the Party.

September 2004 - August 2014  79

The  martyrdom  of  comrade Tutul  has  deprived  the  Purba  Bangla
Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) Lal Pataka and the Maoist movement
of Bangladesh of one of its most able leaders. Yet, we are confident that the
movement will get over the loss and advance the New Democratic Revolution
in Bangladesh which is reeling under acute poverty and fascist army rule.
We once again assure the Purba Bangla Communist Party (Marxist-
Leninist) Lal Pataka that we are with it in this hour of crisis and repeat our
sincere condolence to the ranks of the Party and the family and relatives of
Com Tutul.

The Political Crisis in Nepal is the

Result of Indo-US Conspiracy!

 Oppose the Attempts by Indian Expansionists

to Meddle in the Internal Affairs of Nepal!
People’s Democracy Can be Established in
Nepal Only by Smashing the Old State!!

Withdrawal of support by CPN(UML), MJF and other allies to the
government headed by comrade Prachanda does not come as a surprise to
any keen observer of the unfolding situation in Nepal in the context of the
growing realignment of forces in South Asia and the world at large. South
Asia has become a top-priority zone for American imperialism in the context
of its growing rivalry with China which is seen as the greatest threat to
American imperialism in the world arena in the coming decades. Besides,
its importance has grown against the backdrop of a series of defeats suffered
by the occupation forces of NATO and US in Afghanistan at the hands of
Taliban and the latter’s fast-expanding hold and influence in Pakistan. The
strategy of US imperialism in the region is to contain the growing influence
of China and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), forge a powerful
pro-American axis of powers to turn the tide in its favour in Afghanistan
where its forces are on the run in the renewed Taliban offensive, and establish
its hegemony in the region as part of its global strategic designs. To achieve
this goal American imperialism has been trying to forge an alliance with
Pakistan and India, preaching to Pakistan that it should do away with its
obsession with threat from India and, instead, concentrate on war in its
western frontier to crush Taliban.

US imperialism and Indian expansionism are particularly perturbed
over the growing influence of China over the region, consolidation of
China’s grip over Sri Lanka, and the fear that the government in
Nepal is moving closer to China. And it is this fear which is common

September 2004 - August 2014  81

to  both  India  and  US  that  has  pushed  these  powers  to  oust  the
government led by the Maoists in a bid to install a regime loyal to
them. Hence Washington and Delhi had instructed the allies of UCPN(M)
in the ruling coalition to withdraw support to the government headed by
Prachanda and to form a government with all other forces sans the Maoists.
Attempts are already on to from a government with UML, Koirala’s NC,
MJF and others all of which are loyal to India.

The arch-reactionary UML which dons the garb of Marxist Leninist
had always served the reactionary rulers of Nepal and their foreign masters.
They blame UCPN(M) and com Prachanda for “unilaterally sacking” the
chief of the Army Staff, General Rookmangud Katawal. But why such a
step had to be taken is simply hushed up. Moreover, the unconstitutional
act of the President in reinstating the Army Chief is given legitimacy by
these anti-people Parties. The fact is the army chief had ordered the fresh
recruitment of several thousand soldiers into the Nepal Army while blocking
the integration of the PLA cadres thereby going against the letter and spirit
of the agreement reached between the various parties who waged a unified
struggle against the monarchy. Gen Katawal had also extended the tenure
of several senior Army officers with the aim of retaining the hold of the
pro-monarchy elements over the Army. It is a deliberate planned move by
the reactionary ruling classes of Nepal under the close guidance and planning
of the Indian expansionists and US imperialists. By resuming recruitment
to Nepal Army even before finalizing the integration of the two armies,
these reactionary forces wanted to precipitate the situation and place
the  blame  for  the  break-up  of  the  government  on  the  Maoists
themselves. Thereby they aim to isolate and attack the Maoist forces,
consolidate the anti-people Army, tighten the hold of India-US over
Nepal, and contain the growing influence and competition from China
in the region.

In fact, the Indian ruling classes have been feeling uncomfortable ever
since CPN(M) had emerged as the single largest political Party in the elections
to the CA in April 2008. Their attempts to prevent the formation of a
government headed by the Maoists had failed. Hence they had been waiting
for an opportune moment to topple the government and preparing to create
such a crisis by placing spokes in the process of integration of the two
Armies, advising the Army Chief to go ahead with massive recruitment into

82   Internatioal Messages and Statements

the Nepalese Army, and assuring support to any unconstitutional move to
oust the Maoist-led government.

That Gen Katawal should have been allowed to continue for so long in
office even after his mentor, King Gyanendra, was forced to retreat from
the political scene in Nepal, is itself a bad thing. He had been the most
reliable pillar of the monarchy and the old state power whose interests he
had served all along. He and the Army he heads are representatives of the
old state and naturally would cling to their privileges and class interests until
they are overthrown by force. The attempt by the Maoists to utilize the
apparatus of the old state to bring about change in the social system, instead
of smashing it, is the basis for the development of the present dangerous
situation. Today any slight mistake on the part of the Maoists would result
in grave disaster. The reactionaries in Nepal, with the active aid and
assistance of US and India, are hatching conspiracies to unleash a
blood-bath to wipe out the Maoist forces. The only way to resist these
reactionary attempts is to rely on the revolutionary masses, organize
them against the state and prepare them for street battles basing on
the base areas in the vast countryside. At least now the leadership of the
CPN(M) should realize the futility of the parliamentary path and resume
the people’s war to achieve complete victory by smashing the old state and
reactionary forces, and establishing the people’s democratic state. And to
achieve this, the major chunk of the Party leadership and cadre should go
underground immediately, rely on the vast countryside to wage guerrilla
war on the one hand and mobilise the masses politically in the entire country
against the reactionary forces who are attempting to establish the rule of the
feudal forces, comprador bourgeoisie.

The CC, CPI(Maoist), condemns the Indo-US conspiracy in toppling
the government headed by comrade Prachanda and warns them against
meddling in the internal affairs of Nepal. It pledges all support to the Maoists
in Nepal in their fight against Indian expansionism and cautions them to
beware of the attempts by the reactionary rulers of India to create a blood-
bath of revolutionaries in Nepal.

Let us Unite to Fight Back the Countrywide Brutal Offensive
by the Imperialist-backed Central-State Governments on the

Revolutionary and Democratic Movements in India!
An Appeal by the Central Committee, CPI(Maoist)

to All Revolutionary Parties and Individuals

Dear comrades!

We convey our comradely revolutionary greetings to the rank and file
of all the revolutionary Parties and organsiations and to the revolutionary
masses in the areas of class struggle led by your Parties.

As we all know, the reactionary ruling classes of India, with the total
support and backing of the imperialists, particularly the American imperialists,
have been carrying out the most brutal state terror on the revolutionaries
and struggling people in India, particularly on the armed agrarian revolutionary
war that is raging in the vast adivasi-inhabited region stretching from Paschim
Midnapur-Bankura-Purulia in West Bengal to North Andhra Pradesh. The
state governments of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh,
Orissa, Maharashtra, West Bengal and others are spending huge amounts
to strengthen the special police forces to suppress the revolutionary war in
their respective states. The Centre has deployed 50,000 central forces, set
up special anti-Naxal force called the Cobras, and is planning to raise and
deploy several more battalions of para-military forces for suppressing the
revolutionary movement. The state and central governments have set up
vigilante groups like salwa judum, nagarik suraksha samiti,  shanti sena,
hermad bahini and the frontal organisations of the social-fascist CPI(M)
and other political parties which are carrying out cruel state-sponsored terror
against the entire population in the areas of armed agrarian revolutionary
war.

84   Internatioal Messages and Statements

Ever since the UPA returned to power at the Centre for the second time
in May last, it has stepped up this state terror on an unprecedented scale,
imposed an All India ban on the CPI(Maoist), declared it as a terrorist
organisation, and has declared its intent to brutally suppress the Maoist
revolutionaries even if it meant carrying out a blood-bath in the entire adivasi-
inhabited region. The US and other imperialists are actively goading on
their Indian comprador agents to unleash such a brutal war. As part of this
plan the US delegation had visited Chhattisgarh several times and Washington
is actively overseeing the counter-revolutionary preparations in other states.
The comprador big business houses of India—the Tatas, Jindals, Mittals,
Ruias (Essar), Birlas, Ambanis & others—and imperialist MNCs like Vedanta,
all of which are itching to lay their hands on the abundant forest and mineral
wealth of this vast region, are holding secret parleys with their representatives
in the political establishment to use all means to brutally crush the Maoist
movement. Sonia-Manmohan-Chidambaram clique has been carrying on
hectic consultations with the various political parties, top bureaucrats and
Army  officials  to  deploy  the  notorious  Rashtriya  Rifles—the
counterinsurgency wing of the Indian Army—against the Maoist movement.
A united struggle by all the revolutionary-democratic forces in the
country against this unprecedented cruel state terrorist offensive on the
Maoist movement is the urgent need of the hour. The support and solidarity
extended by the various revolutionary and democratic forces in India and
abroad to the Lalgarh mass uprising and their protest against the massive
state offensive has greatly enthused the adivasi people of the region and the
people of the entire country. This show of solidarity has opened up a new
chapter of unity among the revolutionary and democratic forces.
Comrades!

It is a fact that the revolutionary forces in India have been riven by
serious differences for a long period of time. There is still some bitterness
owing to several reasons and sharp differences exist in the ideological-
political-organisational-military lines. There is need to address these and
achieve stronger unity among the entire revolutionary camp on a principled
basis. Notwithstanding these differences prevailing at present, our Party
earnestly hopes that all the revolutionary parties and organisations in the

September 2004 - August 2014  85

country will come forward at this critical hour in the history of the Indian
revolutionary movement and unite in action to form the broadest united
front against this state terrorist offensive. This revolutionary act will give
immense confidence to the vast adivasi masses and other sections of the
people who are being crushed, displaced and even decimated in accordance
with a well-hatched conspiracy of the reactionary rulers.

Let us keep aside our ideological-political differences and join hands to
fight back this imperialist-backed state offensive in order to defend the
interests of the oppressed masses. The current state terrorist attack by the
Sonia-Manmohan-Chidambaram clique is not just on the CPI(Maoist) and
the people’s war going on in the country but on the entire revolutioanry
camp and the democratic people’s struggles. The aim of this state terrorist
offensive is to suppress the revolutionary leadership of the people so as to
intensify  the  exploitation  and  plunder  of  the  country’s  wealth  by  the
imperialists and the CBB.

There is no time to ponder. LET US ACT NOW.

Comrades Azad and Hemchandra Pandey

Dear Comrades and Friends of Indian Revolution,

On behalf of our Party, the CPI (Maoist), People’s Liberation Guerilla
Army (PLGA), Revolutionary People’s Committees (RPCs), revolutionary
mass organizations and revolutionary people of India, firstly, we send our
heartfelt Laal Salaam (Red Salutes) to all the parties, organizations, various
forums and individuals from India and abroad, who had sent condolence
messages to our CC and who had condemned the brutal murders of comrades
Cherukuri Rajkumar (Azad) and Hemchand Pandey on July 1, 2010 by the
fascist Indian ruling classes. As all of you have acknowledged, losing comrade
Azad is one of the biggest blows our party and Indian revolution had suffered.
Azad was one of the topmost leaders in our party. He has been leading the
Indian  revolution  since  a  long  time.  In  our  country,  People’s War  is
intensifying with each passing day. With the aid and support of imperialists,
particularly the American imperialists, the Indian reactionary ruling classes
are trying to suppress the revolutionary movement and are carrying on
ruthless atrocities in an unprecedented severe manner. In this war between
the people and the ruling classes, the enemy had particularly schemed to
murder our leaders and concentrated on comrades like Azad who are leading
the revolution. It is as part of that conspiracy that comrade Azad was caught
and killed in the most brutal and cowardly manner. Comrade Azad was
leading the entire urban movement on behalf of our Central Committee and
was also looking after political propaganda, party periodicals, party education
and other such crucial responsibilities. He was a most experienced and
popular mass leader. He maintained close relations with many comrades at
various levels and with the revolutionary masses. In the midst of severe
repression, he worked selflessly and unflinchingly in spite of the many risks

September 2004 - August 2014  87

involved. It is under such circumstances that the enemy came to know
about his whereabouts somewhere and could catch him by laying in wait.
Your messages and condemnations released in the true internationalist
spirit had given the necessary moral support to the oppressed peoples and
the comrades who were grief-stricken with this shocking news. Due to the
severe repressive conditions here, we could not receive all the messages
and even the messages we received had reached us very late. Hence we
feel very sorry for this delay in sending you a reply.

Comrade Azad was attracted to the revolutionary movement while he
was studying in the Warangal Regional Engineering College in 1972. Azad
who was exceptionally brilliant in his studies had played a dynamic role in
the revolutionary movement too. He played a role in the formation of the
Radical Students Union (RSU) in 1974. He was elected as the state president
of RSU in 1978. He was one of the founders of the All India revolutionary
student’s movement and guided it from its inception in 1985. He played a
key role in conducting a seminar on Nationality Question in the then Madras
city in 1981. Later he took up the responsibility of building the revolutionary
movement in Karnataka and build up the Maoist party in this State for the
first time. He attracted many comrades like Saketh Rajan into the party.
When opportunistic elements tried to split the party in 1985 and in 1991,
comrade Azad had played a crucial role in defending party line and keeping
it united and strong enough in defeating their opportunist politics.  He worked
tirelessly for twenty years as a CC member and Politburo member from
1990  till  now.  We  cannot  separate Azad’s  life  from  the  history  of
revolutionary movement of the past forty years. Particularly, he played a
key role in the ideological, political spheres, party education and running of
periodicals. He fulfilled the responsibility of the party spokesperson since
three years as ‘Azad’ in the most excellent and exemplary manner. He used
his intellect and sharp pen outstandingly in fighting back the ‘War on People’
led by the Manmohan Singh-Sonia-Chidambaram gang. He stood as the
powerful  voice  of  the  people  against  the  rulers  and  exploiters.  In  the
development of the party’s political line, in the development of the party,
people’s army and mass organizations, in expanding the movement, in the
emergence of new democratic power organs and in all the victories won,
Azad’s ideological, political work and practice played a key role. Unflinching

88   Internatioal Messages and Statements

commitment  in  face  of  any  odds  and  during  the  ebb  and  flow  of  the
movement, great sacrificing nature, selflessness, simple living, indefatigable
work for the revolution and for the interests of the people, astounding
study, study of changing phenomena in the society from time to time, being
with the people always are some of the great proletarian ideals established
by Comrade Azad. Though he is no more, it is undeniable that he would
serve as a revolutionary role model to every revolutionary and particularly
to the youth, students and intellectuals.

Hemchand  Pandey  was  a  progressive  free  lance  journalist  from
Uttarakhand who had used his pen to bring to light the plight of the poor
oppressed people of our country. He was killed as he could bring out the
truth behind Azad’s murder. The brutal murder of this pro-people young
budding intellectual is just another instance of the callousness of the fascists.
You have rightly condemned these ghastly murders by exposing the
conspiracy of the Indian ruling classes in killing Azad, which is to crush the
ever expanding revolutionary movement under the leadership of CPI (Maoist)
and to render the people and party leaderless. Azad’s murder is the latest
one in a series of such murders of our leaders carried out in the name of
‘encounters’  for  the  past  40  years  and  especially  since  the  successful
completion of our Unity Congress-9th Congress in 2007. The government
had declared CPI (Maoist) to be the biggest internal security threat and
launched many suppression campaigns to crush the movement, the latest
being Operation Green Hunt, launched in mid-2009. This is the biggest
offensive launched on the revolutionary movement in India so far and it
has resulted in unprecedented destruction of lives and property of the people.
Extra-judicial killings of leaders and massacres of people are all part of this
counterrevolutionary multi-pronged offensive.

All of you had condemned this war on Indian people, particularly on
the adivasis, with right indignation and demanded that it be immediately
stopped. The people of revolutionary movement areas warmly remember
this international solidarity expressed by various parties, organizations,
individuals and the proletariat of various countries as this is exactly the kind
of support which must be extended to any genuine movement of the people
when it faces such fascist onslaught. We very much appreciate this kind of

support and solidarity and firmly assert that we will reciprocate the same
towards other fighting masses in various parts of the globe. This kind of
solidarity infuses great confidence and reassurance among the fighting people
that there are not alone in their fight. It also points sharply one more time
towards the common enemies we all are facing, namely imperialism and all
kinds of reactionaries. It enhances the fighting spirit of the people and helps
them  to  advance  the  movement  firmly.  Our  party,  PLGA,  RPCs,
Revolutionary Mass organizations, revolutionary people and all progressive
and democratic forces of our country exactly wish for such unity and
solidarity at the domestic and international scale. This is extremely important
to defend the people’s movement and to advance it.

We once again pledge before all of you that we would carry on the lofty
aims of all great martyrs of the world proletarian revolution including
Comrade Azad and announce that no amount of fascist repression can
subdue the fighting spirit of our Party and the revolutionary people of India.
We will march forward with renewed determination braving all kinds of
odds and making sacrifices till the final victory. This is our promise to all
the friends and well-wishers of Indian revolution.

* Long live proletarian internationalism!
* Long live the unity of international proletariat, revolutionary and
democratic forces and the oppressed nations and peoples all over

 Letter to the Central Committee,
Communist Party of the Philippines

To,
The Central Committee,
Communist Party of Philippines

Dear comrades,
Red Salutes.

We convey our warmest revolutionary greetings to all the CC comrades
on the occasion of the advance of the Philippines revolution achieved by
fighting back bravely the “Oplan Bayanihan” campaign of the reactionary
US-Aquino regime and we congratulate you for your appropriate plan to
develop to the stage of strategic equilibrium from the stage of strategic
defence. Please convey red salutes from our entire party to the entire rank
and file of the party and brave commanders and fighters of New People’s
Army. We humbly pay homage to all the great martyrs of Philippines who
have laid down their precious lives in the fight to smash imperialism and all
kinds of local reactionaries and establish a new democratic Philippines and
then to march forward to establish socialism and communism.

As you had mentioned in the special issue of your magazine Ang Bayan,
“Oplan Bayanihan” is nothing but a counter-revolutionary war on the
Philippines people. The Philippines ruling classes are propagating that this
is a plan formulated for the sake of peace-development and human rights.
This is done in accordance with the US counter-insurgency guide-2009.
With the connivance of the lackey Philippines ruling class representatives
like Marcos, Acquino, Arrayo and Jr Acquino, the US is scheming to turn
your country into a strong neo-colony through its military bases. Oplan
Bayanihan has nothing to do with peace-development and human rights
and the promise to make them available for the people is nothing but a big

September 2004 - August 2014  91

sham. We communist revolutionaries are aware that on the contrary this is
a conspiracy to brutally suppress and divert the deluge of people’s struggles
and revolutionary agitations. That is why, as you had mentioned, the Oplan
Bayanihan which was launched for the interests of the imperialists and the
Philippines comprador ruling classes is bound to face defeat.

Our party the CPI (Maoist) is extending its full support to the People’s
War being waged by the revolutionary and democratic forces of Philippines
under the leadership of CPP which also took up concrete tasks to defeat
Oplan Bayanihan. We are striving to vastly propagate about your struggle
in our country and rally the support of the people of our country for it. We
promise to take up this propaganda at the international level too.

Our Central Committee on behalf of our entire party, PLGA, emerging
organs of new people’s power, revolutionary mass organizations and the
revolutionary masses of India conveys its red salutes to the CPP for building
a  solidarity  campaign  against  Operation  Green  Hunt  as  part  of  the
international solidarity against War of the Indian state on the people. This
international solidarity campaign of your party and other International
revolutionary parties in true international spirit has given great moral support
to all of us in our fight against imperialism and all kinds of local reaction.
The Protracted People’s Wars (PPWs) in Philippines and India under
the leadership of our parties have gained recognition as genuine alternatives
to the decadent and corrupt systems in our countries against whom we are
fighting. Maoist parties of Turkey, Bangladesh and some more countries
are trying to consolidate themselves and are trying to advance the people’s
war. This  is  an  optimistic  situation  in  terms  of  the  development  of
revolutionary subjective forces in the world. Wishing that the Philippines
revolution would advance and achieve more successes....

On the Current Situation in Nepal

and the Challenge before the Maoists

Participation in the Constitutional Assembly process, and in government,
in Nepal has been used by the UCPN (Maoist) leadership to liquidate the
revolutionary nature of the party and sink it in the morass of parliamentarism.
For quite some time now, this has been the concrete political manifestation
of  revisionism,  of  the  derailment  of  the  party  from  the  path  of  New
Democratic Revolution. It has now been taken to a new depth with the
recent appointment of Dr. Baburam Bhattarrai as the Prime Minister of
Nepal through a deal with the Madheshi parties, known agents of the Indian
expansionists. Following a script already given by the reactionaries and
endorsed by the UCPN (Maoist) leadership, the new government promptly
handed over the keys of the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) stored
weapons. Severely drained of its fighting qualities through the policies
followed by the leadership of the UCPN(Maoist), it is now being prepared
for formal elimination, to finish off the last remaining, and one of the most
important, achievements of the 10 years of People’s War. Thus the people
will have nothing to bank on and will be helplessly thrown back to the
reactionary wolves.

10 years of heroic war of the masses and their immense sacrifices gave
the tiny organisation CPN (Maoist) international fame and recognition. Once
the emerging shining armour in the glorious history of the international
communist movement, this party is now reduced to being ‘just another
petty political party’, shamelessly bargaining for some space in the ruling
class  benches. Today  the  very  leaders  of  this  organisation  are  trading
sacrifices and pains of the revolutionary masses for a few ministerial posts
and  recognition  from  the  Indian  expansionists,  in  the  service  of  the
imperialists. Every step taken by them is meant to prove to their aakkas
(masters) that they are genuinely committed to abandoning the path of
revolution.

September 2004 - August 2014  93

When communists turn colour and rot the stench is far worse. The
slogan ‘serve the masses’ is converted to ‘serve the imperialist-expansionist
masters’. As the class nature of the party changes, it acquires the ‘most
favoured status’ from the ruling classes. The veil of minimum bourgeois
morality too is shorn off. Shameless degeneration, craving for consumer
goods and luxuries replace communist plain living, revolutionary self-respect
and modesty.  Revisionists are the seeds of reactionaries and slaves of the
imperialists in the revolutionary ranks. In no time they infect the whole
organisation,  decapitate  its  ideological  strength  and  denude  it  of  its
revolutionary  sheen.  The  first  thing  they  do  in  order  to  liquidate  a
revolutionary organisation is by bringing in liberalism in place of firm and
clear ideological position. They abhor Leninist party principles and convert
the organisation into an open non-functional debating forum. Conspiracies
and manipulations become the hallmark of functioning. All these features
can now be seen in the UCPN (Maoist).

The Maoists had gained strategic advantage through the ten years of
People’s War, which liberated vast regions of the country and established
people’s power. The advance of revolution intensified the crisis within the
ruling classes and pushed their imperialist, expansionist mentors into a
quandary. This set the context for the Peace Accord of 2006 and the mass
upheaval that eventually led to the ending of the hated Gyanendra monarchy.
The Maoist party was propelled to a unique position of national leadership,
gaining overwhelming support for the unfinished agenda of revolution. But
instead of utilising these favourable factors and applying tactics suitable to
the fulfilment of these aspirations of the people the leadership deviated
from the strategic tasks of revolution. The ideological, political roots of this
deviation, including the different trends contained in the turn to ‘peace
tactics’, are already a matter of ideological struggle within the Nepalese and
international Maoist movement. The views of our party on this matter,
including correspondence with the UCPN (Maoist) leadership, can be seen
in ‘Naxalbari’ No: 3 (thenaxalbari.blogspot.com). This ideological struggle
must  be  certainly  deepened,  most  importantly  by  the  Nepali  Maoists
themselves. But the immediate task before the Maoists and the revolutionary
masses in Nepal is to raise the flag of open rebellion against the revisionist
headquarters and thus initiate the reconstruction of the party on solid Marxist-

94   Internatioal Messages and Statements

Leninist-Maoist bases, firmly united with the masses. They must get out
off the revisionist swamp of Constitutional Assembly politicking and retake
the road of revolution. The revolutionary heritage of the Maoists in Nepal,
much enriched by the heroic People’s War they led and the glorious sacrifices
made by thousands of the valiant daughters and sons of Nepal, along with
the boundless solidarity of people all over the world with the Nepali revolution
provide the bedrock basis for taking up this challenge. As called for in the
Political Resolution of the CCOMPOSA, “People all over the world look
up  to  the  Maoists  in  Nepal  to  break  out  of  all  domestic  and  external
conspiracies and advance determinedly towards the completion of new
democratic revolution.”

Condolence Message to the Central Committee,

Communist Party of the Philippines on the

Demise of Gregorio “Ka Roger” Rosal

Dear Comrades,

Our CC felt deep sorrow when we heard the news of passing away of
Gregorio “Ka Roger” Rosal, spokesperson and chief of the Information
Bureau of your Party, the CPP. On behalf of the Indian revolutionary
movement and entire revolutionary masses of India, we send our heartfelt
condolences to the CPP, NPA and NDF, all near and dears of the departed
veteran of Filipino revolution. We share your grief. The demise of Ka
Roger is a great loss to entire Communist revolutionaries of the world.

Veteran Communist leader Comrade Roger greatly contributed to the
Filipino revolution ever since he joined into the revolutionary movement in
1972. Born in a poor peasant family in the countryside, he raised to the
level of the spokesperson of the Party. This would inspire every communist
across the world. From ‘Great Escape’, he played crucial role in expanding
and consolidating the Filipino revolution as well as armed struggle and mass
struggles. He strode unwaveringly against all odds faced in his personal and
political life. Understanding the significance of the propaganda work in
revolution he accrued immense experience in propaganda front striving hard.
The way your Party waged a relentless revolutionary propaganda war in
defeating the psychological war being carried out by the imperialists and
their lackey Benigno Aquino III is simply great. It’s been an immense
inspiration to our Party. Despite severe ill health, as a veteran communist
leader Ka Roger had been in touch with the Propaganda Bureau of the CPP
furnishing it with his invaluable suggestions till the end and thus he handed
over his legacy to his comrades so that the tasks of the revolution could be
carried on ceaselessly.

the world people as a model of how communists should think about the

Revolutionary Greetings to the Friends
of Indian Revolution and Well-wishers

13-1-2012

Comrades and Friends,

On 24 November, 2011 the Indian revolution lost its great leader and
the oppressed masses of India lost their most reliable servant. November
24 would remain a dark day in the history of the Indian revolution. On July
1, 2010 the Indian ruling classes had murdered our Politburo member and
spokesperson Comrade Azad. Within one and a half years, another Politburo
member Comrade Koteswarlu (who is popular among the people and party
ranks as Kotanna, Prahlad, Ramji, Kishenji and Bimal) was caught alive in
a covert operation, tortured inhumanly and was killed in a fake encounter.
In India which claims to be the largest democracy in the world, the feudal
and comprador bureaucratic bourgeois ruling classes, with the support of
the imperialists, particularly the US imperialists, are trying to suppress the
democratic, national liberation and revolutionary movements with iron heel.
Particularly, since 2009 they are carrying on an unjust war on the people in
the name of ‘Operation Green Hunt’. They are shamelessly violating even
the constitution and the laws formulated by themselves and are killing people,
activists and leaders of the movement. They are unsuccessfully trying to
justify all their unlawful murders in the name of a lie named ‘encounter’
tracing the footsteps of the British colonial rulers. Now it is an established
fact that ‘encounter’ anywhere in India means a conspiratorial murder by
the state.

Comrade Koteswarlu was born on November 26, 1954 in Peddapalli
town of Karimnagar district which has a legacy of the glorious Telangana
armed struggle. He led the Indian revolutionary movement for nearly four
decades. Comrade Koteswarlu was brought up by democratic thinking
parents and imbibed patriotic feelings and love for the oppressed people
since childhood. He was a top rank representative of the generation after

the glorious Naxalbari rebellion. Though the Naxalbari rebellion which
established  Maoist Protracted People’s War as the path for the Indian
revolution was suppressed within a few years, it had a great impact all over
the country. Peasant rebellions arose in many areas following its model. It
awoke the students in colleges and universities. The slogan ‘Naxalbari Ek
Hi Rasta’ (The Only Way is Naxalbari)  reverberated all over the country. It
was  this  backdrop  that  turned  Comrade  Koteswarlu  into  a  Maoist
revolutionary. Firstly, at the end of 1970s, he organized the peasantry against
deeply entrenched feudalism in his home district of Karimnagar and led
many struggles. He played a key role in the peasant movement popularly
known as ‘Jagityal Jaitrayatra’ (Victory March of Jagityal). In no time this
spread to the whole of North Telangana apart from Karimnagar and Adilabad
districts. Even while mobilizing peasants into anti-feudal struggles, he greatly
strove to attract students, writers, intellectuals, workers…all oppressed
classes and sections of people into the fold of revolutionary movement. In
this course, he worked as a party organizer at first, then as the district
committee secretary and was later elected as the secretary of the Andhra
Pradesh Sate Committee and won the accolade of the people and the party
ranks. Since 1986, he played a crucial role in the development and expansion
of the revolutionary movement in central, eastern and northern parts of
India. He particularly concentrated on Dandakaranya for eight years and
on West Bengal for eighteen years.  Since 1993 till he breathed his last he
worked as a Central Committee member, later as Politburo member member
and held responsibilities for Northern and Eastern Regional Bureaus. He
contributed greatly in many spheres in the party such as political education,
magazines, propaganda and shone as a man of many talents. He played a
prominent role in enriching the party documents and in developing party
political-military line and policies. He represented the CC in the meetings
and bilateral talks held with various national liberation organizations and
Maoist forces in South Asia. He strove a lot to unite the Marxist-Leninist
groups and individuals that divided and scattered after the setback of Naxalbari
and particularly to achieve unity of the ML and MCC organizations which
continued as separate streams since Naxalbari. Thus his role remains etched
forever in the annals of the history of Indian revolution.

At the end of 1970s, Comrade Koteswarlu played a crucial role in the
Jagityal peasant movement and in the first decade of the 21st century he
became the architect of the illustrious Lalgarh people’s upsurge. He was an
September 2004 - August 2014  99

inspiring leader who never left the people and the cadres and who stood
firmly during many an ebb and flow in the Indian revolutionary movement
with courage and initiative. He was an organizer with initiative, a warrior
commander and a guide who imparted love and care. His very presence
proved to be a hard nut to crack for the enemy right from the beginning. He
successfully fought back several attacks and attempts to murder him. He
was a tireless warrior who fought incessantly and uncompromisingly and
never let go of any opportunity to attack the enemy politically and militarily.
That is why the ruling clique of this country led by Sonia-Manmohan-
Chidambaram-Pranab-Jairam colluded with the Chief Minister of West
Bengal Mamata Banerjee and killed him in the cruelest manner. The brutal
signs of torture on his dead body indicate the fascist nature of the enemy,
his cowardliness and his defeat. On the other hand he bore all the inhuman
tortures in the hands of the enemy and emerged victorious even in the face
of death. The crimson of the international red flag of the proletarians turned
deeper with the blood spilled by him in Jungle Mahal.

With  the  murder  of  Comrade  Koteswarlu  @  Kishenji  the  Indian
revolutionary movement lost a great leader. This is a huge loss for our
party. Our party has been continuously losing main leadership forces since
a few years and this loss cannot be surmounted under these circumstances.
However our party would fight firmly to advance the Indian revolution on
the path of victory by overcoming these losses. The exploitative ruling
classes  can  never  comprehend  the  truth  that  people  and  the  people’s
movements give birth to hundreds and thousands of leaders like Koteswarlu
and Azad and they continue daydreaming that they could suppress the
movements by killing the leaders. As long as there are exploitation and
suppression, people would continue to revolt. Leaders like Koteswarlu keep
on emerging. That is why the great struggles with sacrifices and the ideals
established by the thousands of great martyrs serve as an inspiration.

Our Central Committee pays red homage with bowed heads to the
great martyr Comrade Koteswarlu. Our CC is expressing deep empathy to
mother  Madhuramma  who  was  calling  upon  the  people  to  follow  the
footsteps of her son even while immersed in deep sorrow, to other family
members and friends of Comrade Koteswarlu. Our Central Committee calls
upon entire Party, PLGA, activists of mass organizations and revolutionary
masses who are immersed in deep sorrow and agony with the brutal murder

of Comrade Koteswarlu to overcome the grief and intensify the People’s
War. Our CC calls upon the youth to join our Party and PLGA in large

fulfill his cherished dreams. Our party is sending revolutionary greetings to
the democrats and revolutionary sympathizers who brought the deadbody
of Comrade Koteswarlu from West Bengal to Peddapalli and to all the
people who participated in the funeral procession on a huge scale to pay
last respects to the fallen leader by overcoming many restrictions and
encirclements of the governments and police forces. We humbly express
our  thanks  to  various  mass  organizations,  civil  rights  organizations,

and the agitators of Separate Telangana struggle who condemned the brutal
murder  of  Comrade  Kishenji.  Our  red  salutes  to  all  those  writers  and

this killing. Our CC is sending revolutionary greetings to all the revolutionary
parties and democratic organizations of several countries that condemned
the murder of Comrade Kishenji and the war unleashed by the Indian
government on its people and sent condolence messages to our party.

Our CC is firmly taking the vow once again on behalf of the entire
party, PLGA, revolutionary mass organizations and the revolutionary masses
of India that we would advance by overcoming all the hurdles in the path of
accomplishment of New Democratic Revolution of India with the aim of
achieving socialism and communism and that we would carry the unfulfilled

Revolutionary Greetings to the New People’s Army

for Seizing 66 Weapons in the Butuan Raid

10-5-2012

The New People’s Army Front under Front 4 under the NPA North
Central Mindanao Command successfully conducted a raid on an arms
storage facility being maintained by a security agency in Butuan City in the
Mindanao island of Philippines on April 22, 2012 and seized 66 assorted
high-powered firearms. CPI (Maoist) congratulates the NPA commanders
and the red fighters for conducting this successful raid. The caché of firearms
seized by the NPA is composed mostly of AK-47 assault rifles, several
sniper rifles and hand pistols.

NPA  seized  these  modern  weapons  from  the  Earthsaver  Security
Agency’s office that the mining companies had established in Barangay
Libertad,  Butuan  City. This  brave  raid  enthused  the  people  and  the
revolutionary forces of Philippines a lot. This raid served as a model to the
NPA forces all over Philippines. The people and the NPA hailed the NPA
forces in the North Central Mindanao Command. Many young women and
men who were motivated by this raid are coming forward to join NPA.
They are readying themselves to advance the armed agrarian revolution in
their country. Our party, the CPI (Maoist) is sharing this elation along with
you.  This  incident  very  much  inspired  the  advancing  revolutionary
movements in Philippines, India, Turkey and other countries.

In  the  past  few  years,  the  NPA  revolutionary  guerillas  led  by  the
Communist Party of Philippines conducted hundreds of tactical counter
offensives on the counter-revolutionary police (APP) and military forces
(AFP). They seized hundreds of weapons. These offensives played a crucial
role in advancing the People’s War in Philippines. At present, the Philippines
revolution is striving to advance in a planned manner from the stage of
strategic  self-defence  to  the  stage  of  strategic  stalemate.  The  NPA
revolutionary forces conducted the Butuan raid as part of this. Within a few
102   Internatioal Messages and Statements

days of this incident, on April 25, 2012, in a brave ambush conducted by
the NPA in Ifugao, eleven soldiers including battalion operations officer of
the 86th Infantry Battalion were wiped out. This is another big blow to the
Philippines Army this year.

Comrade Mao has repeatedly taught us that wiping out the enemy and
seizing of weapons play the most crucial role in establishing the New
Democratic society by overthrowing the exploiting society. The task of the
revolutionaries all over the world who are following the path of Protracted
People’s War is to wipe out the enemy in huge numbers on the one hand
and on the other hand build revolutionary people’s armies with the weapons
seized from the enemy forces, train them, further advance the People’s
War and establish alternative people’s political power. At present, it is
necessary to conduct many more raids like Butuan for the advance of the
World Socialist Revolution. Through such raids we must build the people’s
political power, strengthen it and expand it. Our party is sending revolutionary
greetings to the NPA and CPP for placing a model in front of the world
revolutionaries through this Butuan Raid. Communist revolutionary parties,
groups and revolutionaries following the path of People’s War formulated
by Comrade Mao would definitely advance forward by emulating the model
of Butuan Raid.

Hail the Formation of Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist

The CC, CPI (Maoist) is sending its warmest revolutionary greetings to
you and all the CC members and the entire rank and file of the CPN-
Maoist on the formation of the new revolutionary party in Nepal after a
prolonged internal ideological and political struggle against the opportunist
and neo-revisionist leadership within the party who betrayed the Nepalese

revolution and by demarcating and making a break with them.

Even while the Nepal Revolution reached the stage of strategic offense,
the  UCPN  (Maoist)  leadership  assessed  the  national  and  international
situation subjectively, took erroneous tactics and bogged itself in the quagmire
of parliamentarianism with capitulationism uninterruptedly since end 2005.
The opportunist faction that was dominant in the party rapidly went on
taking  modern  revisionist  positions  including  12-point,  8-point,
Comprehensive Peace Agreement etc thus betraying the cause of the Nepal
people and causing enormous harm to the New Democratic Revolution in
Nepal. The revolutionary faction of the UCPN (Maoist) led by Comrade
Kiran and other revolutionaries put up a fight against the neo-revisionist
stands that harmed the interests of the Nepal oppressed masses and have
split at various stages from the revisionist leadership. Our CC considers
such splits resorted to by genuine revolutionaries demarcating from the
neo-revisionist leadership and its erroneous right opportunist line as correct
steps that would advance the revolution in Nepal and serve the interests of
the oppressed classes and all oppressed social sections in Nepal. Our CC
hails the formation of CPN-Maoist and offers its support and solidarity to
the new party with Proletarian Internationalism. We wholeheartedly wish
that your Congress scheduled to be held in February 2013 would be a great
success and that it would be successful in adopting a correct ideological

104   Internatioal Messages and Statements

political line and path of the revolution and on this basis in uniting and
consolidating all the genuine revolutionary forces in the country.

On this joyous occasion, we would like to put in a word which we
learned from our own experience. The CPN (Maoist) and  heroic people
of Nepal waged Protracted People’s War (PPW) for seizure of political
power, got steeled and strengthened in war and achieved great successes.
But now for a long period of more than 7 years the PPW has been
abandoned  and  the  party  and  the  people  have  been  engaged  in
parliamentary, peaceful and legal activities. In such a backdrop, the
great qualities that were gained due to PPW may have undergone a
significant  change  now.  So  those  have  to  be  regained  with  correct
ideological and political line, path of revolution, class struggle, conscious
effort and practicing proletarian life style and work style. Ideological,
political and organizational mistakes done during the internal struggle
are to be identified correctly and rectified very seriously. The mistakes
you realized and rectified while forming the new party give us good
hope that you are advancing in this direction and we wholeheartedly
hope that it would continue.

Revolutionaries may still be present in the neo-revisionist Prachanda-
Bhattarai faction of the party, so your stand of continuing internal struggle
and keeping the doors open till the Congress is correct. We feel that
efforts must be put later too to unite the genuine revolutionaries and
there should a scope for them to join the genuine revolutionary party.
Some comrades had left the party beforehand and we hope that you
would put efforts to unite with all such genuine revolutionary forces
that have demarcated themselves from the neo-revisionists. This unity
of all revolutionary forces on correct ideological and political line would
be very necessary to isolate revisionists and to unite people in the larger
interests  of  the  revolution. As  we  are  all  aware  any  one  country’s
communist  party  cannot  intervene  in  another  country  regarding  the
political line, strategy and tactics to be followed by the communist party
there. But it would be necessary to hear and pay serious attention to the
critical opinions/observations that would be placed before you by the
International Maoist parties with proletarian internationalist spirit.

September 2004 - August 2014  105

We sincerely hope that your new party would play its role in the liberation
of  the  oppressed  masses  of  South Asian  people  with  International
Proletarianism as before. Just a few years back Nepal was on the threshold
of building a revolutionary base for the World Socialist Revolution and we
hope the new party would continue to work to fulfill this task by putting
efforts for advancing towards victory in Nepal. Still there is every possibility
of capturing power in Nepal in a new manner in spite of great dangers. We
hope that our two parties along with all fraternal Maoist parties in South
Asia would put up a united, consistent and tough fight against Indian
expansionism, imperialism and all kinds of reactionaries.

We hope that the new party would boldly uphold MLM, creatively
apply it to the concrete new context and the nature of the society in Nepal,
would oppose all types of revisionism, particularly Prachanda-Bhattarai
modern revisionism in Nepal to fulfill the revolutionary aspirations of the
proletariat and oppressed people of Nepal and the world.

We end this letter with the great hope that CPN-Maoist would uphold
revolutionary  traditions  of  the  great  oppressed  masses  of  Nepal  and
Proletarian Internationalism and fulfill the dreams of thousands of great
martyrs of Nepal revolution.

Manipur and other oppressed nationalities situated to the North-East of
India have a rich tradition of struggles against the colonial British rule and
later against the imperialist lackey Indian expansionists. The people in these
states have suffered for a long time under the exploitation, oppression,
control  and  repression  of  the  British  colonial  rulers  and  the  Indian
expansionists.  The  glorious  people  of  Manipur  and  these  states  have
established great heroic traditions of sacrifice in their protracted fight for
national liberation while fighting the British imperial army and the Indian
paramilitary forces and the Army at present.

In such a backdrop, our party considers the formation of a proletarian
revolutionary party by the name Maoist Communist Party of Manipur as
an event of historical significance in the annals of the history of revolution
in South-Asia and that it would facilitate the way for liberation of the
oppressed nationalities and people of oppressed classes not only in Manipur
but in entire North-East of the sub-continent. The successful advance of
the revolution in Manipur under the leadership of a Maoist party also would
positively impact the advance of the struggles at various levels in other
states in the NE and New Democratic Revolution in India. So our CC

September 2004 - August 2014  107

considers the formation of your party as a matter of strategic significance
for the Indian revolution and other revolutions in South-Asia.

Since the forceful annexation of the sovereign nation states in the NE
by the Indian ruling classes, the people there have been fighting heroically
against this historical injustice for their liberation or right to self-determination
including cessation. The Indian state deployed lakhs of paramilitary and
Army in these states to suppress these struggles and the atrocities committed
by these forces are one of the worst in the world. Thousands of worthy
daughters and sons of these oppressed nationalities have laid down their
precious lives in this entire bloody trial left by one of the cruelest forces in
the world. Our party salutes all the great martyrs of Manipur and once
again vows to stand firmly with Manipuri people in their struggle for national
liberation and against class exploitation and oppression.

Our party hopes that the newly formed Maoist party would hold aloft
the flag of struggle for national liberation and independence and all the
heroic traditions that the people of this region of South-Asia established in
the course of the various glorious struggles. We firmly believe that it would
be one of the foremost tasks of the Maoist party to unite the various sections
of people and nationalities in this entire strategic area to defeat the ‘divide
and rule’ policies followed by the Indian expansionists as a legacy of their
British imperial masters and that have caused enormous harm to the liberation
of the people in the NE since decades. Our party gives assurance with
clenched fists to your party and the entire Manipur nation that it would
fight shoulder to shoulder with them in the fight against the common enemy
- the Indian State - that is the biggest hurdle to the liberation of the people
of both Manipur and India - and in defeating it.

We wholeheartedly aspire that you would strengthen in the process of
Protracted People’s War and would also in this course unite all the genuine
revolutionary forces and all broad democratic forces that oppose Indian
expansionism in Manipur on the basis of correct line and correct politics
and that you would achieve great successes during the course of New
Democratic Revolution in Manipur and advance to final victory.

Hail the Filipino Revolution Advancing in the

Path of Victory with the Immediate Task

of  Achieving Strategic Stalemate !
Extend Strong Support to Filipino
Revolution and Filipino People!

Oppose and Condemn Oplan Bayanihan !

Observe Solidarity Week to Filipino
Revolution from April 22 to 28, 2013

It is now crystal clear to the world people as well as the people of
India that a barbaric military campaign i.e., ‘Oplan Bayanihan’ is being
carried out by the American puppet Benigno Aquino regime in a bid to
destroy the on-going revolution with the immediate and central slogan
achieving strategic stalemate under the leadership of the Communist
Party of Philippines.

Philippines is in South East Asia spread in a land of three lakh
square  kilometers  with  a  population  of  nine  and  a  half  crores.  The
freedom-loving Filipino people have a glorious history and heroic long
tradition of revolutionary struggles and sacrifices against the colonial
rule and particularly against the American imperialism. This is a semi-
colonial, semi-feudal country having a rich cultural heredity. The country
of Philippines is rich with enough variable kinds of resources for self-
reliance. The crores of toiling masses are a strong foundation to the
country to develop as a sovereign, free, democratic country. The workers
and  peasants  of  the  country  are  the  main  source  in  bringing  the
exploitation and suppression of the imperialists and their comprador
ruling classes to an end and achieve a genuine democracy and progress
in the society.

September 2004 - August 2014  109

The National Democratic Revolution was initiated in Philippines from
1896.  But  in  early  1930s,  the  Communist  Party  of  Philippines  (CPP)
emerged from the anti-feudal struggles. After traversing through a zig-zag
course, and after defeating the revisionists in the party, it was only in the
2nd half of 1960s the CPP was able to take up a correct path of the revolution
in the backdrop of a great upheaval in the international arena against US
imperialists under the leadership of Mao-CPC and genuine revolutionary
and democratic forces. From that time the New Democratic Revolution
(NDR) of Philippines again began to advance with a new spirit. With the
help  of  people's  army,  i.e.,  New  People’s Army  (NPA)  and  National
Democratic Front (NDF), the NDR began to advance by gaining more and
more successes through massive mass participation. At present, CPP is the
most trusted and popular Party of the people of Philippines which is leading
all the struggles of all oppressed classes and social sections against US
imperialism, feudalism and comprador capitalism to advance the national
democratic revolution to its successful completion.

As the crisis in the semi-colonial, semi-feudal system is increasing, the
people of all strata have begun to rally more and more under the red banner
of CPP.

Getting afraid by seeing the popularity of the present on-going NDR,
and by feeling the danger to their exploitative system the Benigno Acquino
government  unleashed  and  carried  out  one  after  another  suppressive
campaigns under various names. ‘Oplan Bayanihan’ is the latest form of
all-out multi-pronged suppressive campaign let loose by the US imperialist
lackey Benigno government. ‘Oplan Bayanihan’ campaign is the most cruel,
barbaric and all-out military campaign which is being conducted in a fascist
way by the reactionary US puppet regime.

But, the Filipino people, under the leadership of CPP and with the help
of NPA and NDF are fighting bravely and militantly and even by sacrificing
their lives in every corner of country against this barbaric ‘Oplan Bayanihan’,
thus standing on a point of inspiration and enthusiasm to the working class
and oppresed nationalities and people across the world.

Under such circumstances, the Central Committee of CPI (Maoist) in
its 2012 August Meet decided to observe solidarity week from April 22 to
28, 2013 in support of Philippine revolution and called upon the people,
rank and file of the Party as well as all the progressive, democratic and
revolutionary forces of India to strongly oppose and condemn vehemently
the barbaric military campaign i.e., ‘Oplan Bayanihan’.

Today the movement is fighting with great and high objectives. Presently
it is advancing from the stage of strategic defensive to the stage of strategic
stalemate. It now has …. Guerilla fronts. It is working with the task of
increasing them to ….by 2015. the 42nd anniversary of NPA held in 2011
decided to seize twenty five weapons from the enemy in the coming five
years and hand them to the ….companies to be formed. It is giving strong
blows to the enemy through the tactical counter offensive and stands as a
point of enthusiasm and inspiration to the oppressed masses over the world
and mainly the people’s armed forces. Despite the kidnapping, atrocities,
house burnings, loot and banning of revolutionary organizations, the people
and the NPA and NDA that are in support of the people are fighting under
the leadership of CPP. Let us all extend support to them. Let us voice to
them that they are not alone. Let us send our solidarity message to them.
All of us demand to stop the Benigno government-led ‘war on people’
with immediate effect ! Demand the lifting of all the American military
bases in Philippines ! Demand the unconditional and immediate release of
all political prisoners in the Philippine jails ! Extend solidarity and support
to the heroic Filipino revolution going on against the fascist rule of Benigno
Acquino serving the interests of the imperialists, especially the American
imperialists, comprador big bourgeoisie and the big feudal classes !

CPI(Maoist)  and  all  the  revolutionary  masses  of  the  country  are
extending their strong support and revolutionary solidarity to all of you.
Both parties are waging the revolutionary wars in India and Philippines
with enormous sacrifices to achieve their immediate and ultimate goals. We
promise that we would continue the revolutionary war with indomitable
determination, not hesitating to any kind of sacrifices in order to make
success the New Democratic Revolution. We also pledge to be a strong co-

internationalism to serve the world proletarian revolution and stand firmly
in support of the success of NDR in Philippines. The great people of
Philippines, CPP and NPA are invincible. The working class and oppressed
nationalities and people of the world are with you. Advance ! Ultimately
victory would be yours ! Defeat would be to the US imperialists and their
Philippine lackeys !

Dear Comrade,

I on behalf of the CC, CPI (Maoist) congratulate you and entire CC
and your party on the successful completion of the 7th National Congress
of CPN-Maoist.

We have received belatedly the two letters written by you with the
subject of high importance to the friendly relations between two parties and
the people dated 4-09-2013 and invitation for 7th National Congress of
CPN-Maoist held from 9 to 13 January 2013 at Kathmandu dated 24-12-
2012. Before these, we belatedly received the letters and articles written by
Comrade Basanta. The arrest of the in-charge of our international department
Comrade Srikant is the reason for this late receiving.

I hope you received the letter and message hailing the formation of the
new party reached you. This message has been published in our MIB-26
too and you must have seen it. In the previous letter addressed to you, we
wrote to you regarding strengthening fraternal relations, bilateral talks,
People’s  Forum  and  your  fight  against  the  revisionism  of  Prachanda-
Bhattarai. Strengthening the relations between our two parties has significance
not only to South Asia but also to the ICM. Let both our parties strive for it.
In  our  previous  letter  we  mentioned  about  the  decision  taken  in
CCOMPOSA regarding the Chairperson/leading person for the People’s
Forum and our opinion regarding it. Later we discussed this matter in our
CC and opined that Jagmohan would be better as the Chairperson and
Saroj Giri and Amit Bhattacharya would be better as members of the Forum.
All three had gained recognition and reputation in various fields of democratic

Let Us Hold High the Banner of Proletarian Internationalism!
LAL SALAM at the Success of the ‘International Conference

in Support of the People’s War in India’!

Dear Comrades,

On behalf of our Party, the CPI (Maoist), People’s Liberation Guerilla
Army (PLGA), Revolutionary People’s Committees (RPCs), Revolutionary
Mass Organizations and revolutionary people of India, firstly, we send our
warmest revolutionary greetings and heartfelt Lal Salam (Red Salutes) to
all the parties, organizations and individuals from India and abroad that had
put great efforts to build up a world wide support and solidarity for the
New  Democratic  Revolution  (NDR)  in  India  and  made  success  the
‘International  Conference  in  Support  of  the  People’s War  in  India’  at
Hamburg on 24th November 2012.

Your messages and speeches released in genuine internationalist spirit
at the Hamburg Conference had given the essential moral support to the
oppressed peoples and the comrades fighting a bitter battle with the class
enemies in this battle front of World Socialist Revolution i.e., in India. As
each one of you is aware severe repressive conditions are continuing here
with increasing intensity that are becoming extensive day by day and so we
could not receive your messages in time and even the messages we received
had reached us very late. We are really very sorry for this delay in responding
to your good efforts.

It particularly heartened us to note that youth, students, women and
cultural activists participated actively in the Hamburg conference. Report
of the campaigns taken up at such varied corners of the globe filled us with
warmth and enthusiasm and more than everything this entire solidarity made
us feel even more humble and responsible towards the world proletariat

September 2004 - August 2014  115

and about playing our role in the WSR. We were also to have participated
and  played  a  main  role  in  this  campaign  but  could  not  due  to  the
unprecedented enemy onslaught.

You united your hands with us in the grief stricken hours when we
faced serious losses at the top whether it be the martyrdom of Comrades
Shyam, Mahesh and Murali in 1999 or the martyrdom of comrades Azad
& Kishenji in the recent past– all of whom were great leaders of our
revolution brutally murdered by the Indian ruling classes with the tacit support
of the imperialists. Your assertion ‘the struggle of Maoists in India is our
struggle, their loss is our loss’ filled our hearts with the solace laced with
internationalist spirit much needed to overcome the grief and advance with
undaunted courage.

You had aptly stated that the way to honour all martyrs of the revolution
in India and in the world is redoubling the support to People’s War in India
as a part of intensifying struggle against imperialism in the world and working
for proletarian internationalism and we believe that the Hamburg Conference
had proven that it was a further step in fulfilling your commitment as you
had concluded.

All of you had been consistently condemning and protesting the Indian
state’s war on its people with right indignation and demanding that it be
immediately stopped. The people of revolutionary movement areas warmly
remember  this  international  solidarity  expressed  by  various  parties,
organizations, individuals and the proletariat and people of various countries
as this is exactly the kind of support which must be extended to any genuine
movement of the people.

You launched world-wide campaigns of support to the People’s War in
India, particularly in the belly of the imperialist beast, the countries where
most of you operate and its significance is very much appreciated by us and
the fighting people in one of the storm centres of world revolution.

We very much value this kind of support and solidarity and firmly assert
that we will reciprocate the same towards other fighting parties, organizations
and masses in various parts of the globe. This kind of solidarity infuses great
confidence and reassurance among the fighting people that they are not alone in
their fight. It also points sharply one more time towards the common enemies

116   Internatioal Messages and Statements

we all are facing, namely imperialism, their puppets/lackeys and all kinds of
reactionaries world over. It enhances the fighting spirit of the people and forces
and helps them to advance the movement firmly. Our party, PLGA, RPCs,
Revolutionary Mass Organizations, revolutionary people and all progressive
and democratic forces of our country exactly wish for such unity and solidarity
at the domestic and international scale. This is extremely important to defend
the People’s War and to advance it.

Every party and organization that expressed solidarity to the ongoing
People’s War in India had realized this task as the foremost not only in the
context of the revolution in their respective countries but also in the context
of expressing solidarity to other revolutions. The spirit that advancing the
revolution in our respective countries is the best way of expressing solidarity
to similar revolutions in other countries has been expressed most profoundly
in this conference and we concur with it completely. We, the Maoists in
India are also working with this same spirit and this has been the hallmark
of our practice ever since the days of the Naxalbari armed peasant uprising
led by genuine revolutionaries.

Our Party which carries forward the legacy of Naxalbari had always
considered the NDR that we are waging in India as an integral part of the
WSR, the Party a detachment of the world proletariat vanguard, i.e. the
communist party, the PLGA a detachment of the world proletarian army
and Revolutionary People’s Committees being established here an integral
part of world proletarian dictatorship or world socialist state. The invaluable
and incredible sacrifices that are being done by the people and comrades in
our revolution are also an integral part of the great sacrifices done by
innumerable beloved martyrs of WSR in each and every country. It is with
this understanding that the various genuine revolutionary streams in India
that worked since Naxalbari have taken up solidarity campaigns supporting
the  revolutions  and  people’s  movements  in  other  countries  the  most
prominent of which were the solidarity campaigns taken up in support of
revolutions in Vietnam, Laos and Kampuchea and the national liberation
struggles in Palestine, Tamils in Srilanka etc and wars of resistance of Iraq
and Afghanistan people. The latest is our solidarity campaign in support of
Philippines New Democratic Revolution taken up by our Party from April
22 to 28, 2013.

September 2004 - August 2014  117

Our  party  believes  that  such  solidarity  campaigns  can  sustain  and
strengthen only from the advancement of the revolutionary movements
and that the revolutionary movements in turn gain the much needed moral
and material strength from such solidarity campaigns. Their interrelation
should be realized in depth by all revolutionaries in the world situation at
present and we understand that the Hamburg Conference could take the
right step in that direction because of this realization.

The launching of the multi-pronged countrywide offensive in the name
of Operation Green Hunt, most appropriately termed as the War on People
and the barbarous innumerable atrocities committed by the reactionary
central and state mercenary armed forces as part of it had enraged a wide
range of people cutting across various world views both inside India and
the world and immediately led to huge protests and campaigns demanding
its immediate withdrawal. Consistent efforts at the domestic and international
level were put by revolutionary, democratic, progressive forces to build
international campaigns supporting the fighting people in India and to put
pressure on the Indian government to stop the onslaught. The communist
revolutionary forces world over also rightly took the initiative to build up an
international solidarity movement to the People’s War in India. The campaign
to end OGH and the solidarity movement in support of People’s War in
India complement each other and the anti-OGH programs should form an
integral part of the support movement to Indian revolution as defeating this
multi-pronged countrywide offensive of the enemy is an immediate task
before us. Our party believes that it is the need of the hour for the communist
forces standing in support of PW in India to strive to mobilize the broadest
possible anti-imperialist, democratic and revolutionary forces to strengthen
the campaign to end OGH and with a view to build a broad worldwide anti-
imperialist front that is in process. And the further strengthening of the
unity of communist forces world over would lead to stronger support for
the Indian Revolution too.

Imperialism is going through its most severe crisis till date and on the
other hand struggles of the working class, other oppressed classes and sections
of people, national liberation struggles and People’s Wars in semi-colonial
and semi-feudal countries are on the rise. The New Democratic Revolutions
in  semi-colonial,  semi-feudal  or  neo-colonial  countries  and  Socialist

118   Internatioal Messages and Statements

Revolutions in the capitalist-imperialist countries which are the two streams
of the World Socialist Revolution (WSR) are advancing at various levels
and Marxism-Leninism-Maoism is increasingly being embraced by more
and more people as their guiding ideology. People are progressively realizing
that the imperialists, their lackey/puppet rulers in the backward countries
and all kinds of reactionaries are the common enemies of all the oppressed
people and nations in the world and so are joining the fighting ranks in
growing numbers. All the fundamental contradictions in the world and
internally in every country are sharpening and intensifying with each passing
day. To be precise, the world situation is excellent for revolution. So the
foremost task before the communists everywhere in the world is to best
utilize this excellent objective condition to politically mobilize and consolidate
the oppressed masses and to strengthen the subjective forces as only a
strong proletarian party and consolidated masses can make revolution
successfully.

The present financial crisis in which the world capitalist system is getting
bogged down increasingly is intensifying the internal contradictions in
capitalist system as a whole and is giving rise to huge mass movements,
revolts and revolutions. Imperialism is already on the death bed as analyzed
by our Great Marxist teacher Lenin and the present crisis is reiterating the
fact strikingly. In the uneven capitalist world, crises would also be reflected
in an uneven manner in various countries. So we communists should apply
the universal theory, i.e. MLM to the concrete practice in our respective
countries and our preparations or practice should also be in accordance for
making our revolutions successful. As all of you had rightly pointed out
workers, student, youth, women etc movements are to be developed in
capitalist countries and supporting the PWs in other countries would also
constitute an inseparable foremost international task of each and every
proletarian party.

 In response to the great confidence placed on us by all the fraternal
parties and organizations that took the initiative for organizing this conference
and made it a success we pledge one more time to sustain, strengthen and
advance the revolution in India to fulfill the dreams of the martyrs of the
WSR in spite of the severe losses of top leadership comrades and loss of
some areas.

This international conference deals a hard blow to imperialism and the
Indian ruling classes while at the same time it fills great hopes among the
great ocean of proletariat and oppressed toiling masses about NDR in India
and the WSR. In this backdrop we once again pledge before all of you that
we would carry forward the lofty aims of all great martyrs of the world
proletarian revolution and announce that no amount of fascist repression
can subdue the fighting spirit of our Party and the revolutionary people of
India that are traversing through an arduous and protracted zigzag path. We
will march forward with renewed determination braving all kinds of odds
and making sacrifices till the final victory. This is our promise to the

We got the letter you wrote on 5 October 2004. The unification of
CPI(ML)[PW] and MCCI under a single flag and the unification of the
PGA and PLGA led by the two parties under a single flag is a significant
advancement in Indian revolution. Not only that, it has a great national and

revolutionary masses of India.

Hearing the news of the formation of the CPI(Maoist) today, we

teachings, we are remembering the great Naxalbari. With deep respect we
are  remembering  Comrade  Kanhai  Chatterji.  In  the  same  way  we  are

comrades who have laid down their lives for the advancement of the Indian

Indian expansionism is one of the major problems in the path of
successfully completing the revolution in the countries of the subcontinent
including ours. Indian expansionism will certainly be given a blow by the
advancement that has been made by the Indian revolution through the
unification of CPI(ML[PW] and MCCI under a single flag. As a result,
advancement in the revolutions in the countries of the subcontinent including
ours will be intensified. Moreover, we strongly believe that the unity of

The unity of genuine Maoists is sought for and important at any comer

Formation of a united Maoist party by unifying the genuine Maoists of
India splitted under different centres on the basis of a correct MLM-ist line
is a very important task for Indian and world revolution. We hope that this
unity of yours will advance forward that goal.

The problem of unity of Maoists is not any domestic matter, but in
essence an international problem. So, Maoist revolutionaries of all countries
should have to work for the international unity of genuine Maoists of whole
world. Revolutionary Internationalist Movement (RIM) has been formed
with this goal, and our party is one of its members. We hope that the
Communist Party of India (Maoist) will develop healthy discussions &

the liberation of the people of Manipur from the clutches of the Indian
Government. Where as we understand That the CPI (Maoist) is waging an
armed struggle for the liberation of Indian masses from the oppression by
the same Indian Government. In order that these struggles are to succeed,
the present ruling class is to be defeated. This can only be achieved through
waging a co-ordinated and joint armed struggle against the present Indian
state. To build up such co-ordinated and joint struggle it is a necessity that
an understanding be brought between the parties, who are leading the armed
revolutionary struggle in Manipur and in India.

We apologise for our inability to carry forward the efforts to bring such
an understanding in the past due to various reasons despite of best efforts
from both sides. We would like to assure that our party is committed to
carry forward the efforts to bring an understanding between the parties to
make co-ordinated and joint struggle against the Indian state a reality.

capitalist wage slavery.

United, the national democratic revolutions in Asia, Africa and Latin
America and the socialist revolutions in the developped capitalist countries
will destroy imperialism and its barbaric dictatorship. Socialism is the
future  of  mankind  In  a  situation  when  US  imperialism  choses  for
militarization and war as its strategic option to try and get out of the
chronic crisis of capitalist overproduction, and when inter-imperialist
contradictions are intensifying, the question of a broad united front against
the most dangerous and immediate enemy on a world scale, takes on
renewed significance.   Long live the international communist movement!

Communist Party of India (Maoist)

Dear Comrades.

Red Salutes from the Workers Communist Party, Norway (AKP), to
the Communist Party of India(Maoist) on the ocassion of the important
step forward in the history of the revolution in India. by the merger of
Communist Party of India(Marxist-Leninist)[People’s War] and the Maoist
Communist Centre of India!

Already we have observed that this strengthening of the revolutionary
pole in the class struggle of India are met by wild counter-attacks from the
bourgeoisie in India. Manifestations to salute the merger have been obstructed
both in Delhi and in Patna, showing that the India bourgeoisie have not the
intention to change their rulership by pure debate and elections not even
allowing legitimate poitical activities like this.

As the CPI(Maoist) put forward in their first declarations, the proletatian
intemationalism and the strengthening of the frontline struggle against the
imperialists all over the globe are a common cause for the revolutionary
parties and organisations in all countries. Today the struggle of the heroic
Iraqi and Afghan people against the leading imperialist power of today, the
USA are of utmost importance also for the struggle in India as well as in the
imperialist countries like Norway. In a manner that our struggle to restrain
our bourgeoisies from backing up the USA is helping both our friends as
well as strenghtening the revolutionary forces in our own countries.

The developement of the revolutionary struggle in India, beeing a country
planned to be one of the main bases for further developement of the world
wide imperialist system, affects all of us. Also for this reason the AKP

Central Committee (Provisional)
Communist Party of India (Maoist)

Attention: Comrade Ganapathy, General Secretary
Dear Comrade Ganapathy,
General Secretary and
Comrades of the Central Committee (Provisional)
of the Communist Party of India (Maoist)

We gratefully acknowledge receipt of your letter of November 1, 2004.
By way of reply, I, on behalf of the National Executive of the East Indian
Defence Committee wish to make the following points:

First of all we Hail the formation of the CPI(Maoist) by the merger
of the Communist Party of India(M-L) (People’s War) and Maoist
Communist Centre of India.

We extend our heartfelt greetings to you as the General Secretary and
to the comrades of the Central Committee (Provisional) and rank and file
of the new CPI(Maoist) on the successful conclusion of this merger. This
event is a very important one in the history of the communist movement in
India. It signifies a significant and memorable milestone in the trend of
unification  around  the  correct  political  line  among  Marxist-Leninist
revolutionaries in India in particular and South Asia in general. Your unification
is a significant victory for the proletarian revolutionary line in the Indian
Communist movement. This revolutionary subjectivity - the union - is a
victory  that  transcends  all  apparent  defeats.  By  your  deeds  you  have
overwhelmed what only appeared to be failure. Your victory is not only
empirical, but both constitutive and symbolic, at the same time. Such events,
in the history of the Indian communist movement are rare indeed.

Looking back, our felicitations to you on this September 21, 2004
occasion of your unification has a long and honourable pedigree. In June

September 2004 - August 2014  133

1968 the Ad-Hoc Committee of the Hindustan Ghadar Party was formed in
Montreal. In January 1969 Indian Progressive Study Group dedicated to
organizing Indian students in Universities and Colleges was formed in
Montreal. In September 1970 the Hindustani Ghadar Party (Marxist-Leninist)
Organization of Patriotic Indians Abroad was formed in Toronto. In August
1971  Hind  Mazdoor  Lehr  (Group  of  Indian Workers)  was  formed  in
Vancouver. In November 1973 East Indian Defence Committee was formed
in Vancouver. All five organizations had associations with the Communist
Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist). All five organizations, hailed the 1967
Spring Thunder of Naxalbari, the leadership of Charu Mazumdar and the
correct  political  line  of  the  May  1970  Eighth  Party  Congress  of  the
Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). Comrades of the East Indian
Defence Committee have been consistent supporters of that correct political
line. Recently on the occasion of the 30th Anniversary of Founding of East
Indian Defence Committee Celebrations and 19th Convention on November
28-29 of 2003, concluded a Resolution on Acknowledging The Trend
Towards Unification among Marxist-Leninist Groups in India and Pledged
East Indian Defence Committee to Support Indian Revolutionaries Who
Follow Comrade Charu Mazumdar’s line and the General Orientation of
the Naxalbari Way. For more than three decades, our organization has kept
abreast of, albeit with great concern, the terrible effects of state repression
against communist revolutionaries in India. Comrades of the East Indian
Defence Committee have been studying the great debates in the Indian
communist movement, which unfortunately resulted in a great many splits,
both in India and abroad. It is sufficient to underline here that throughout
this period of more than three decades, there was zero support for the chief
opportunist Satya Narain Singh and renegades of his variety, amongst our
comrades.

Comrades, your unification is profound historical activity that has dealt
a heavy setback to that particular brand of Indian opportunism that raises
the false distinction between “Ends” and “Means” and lends theoretical
justification to alliances with bourgeois socialists such as the CPI and
CPI(Marxist), as the “lesser evil”. In the glorious history of revolutionary
Marxism in India, these right deviations have been the bane of the Communist
movement in India. Not many in the Indian communist movement disagree

134   Internatioal Messages and Statements

with the noble goals of Indian revolution. However, the class position of
some opportunists forces them to “regret” that Marxism-Leninism in India
should  pursue  such  noble  ends  through  what  they  contend,  are  such
unacceptable methods. These opportunists denounce Indian revolutionaries
for  pursuing  their  goals  maximally.  The  opportunists  say  that  this
revolutionary activity is the ultra-leftism of “at all costs”. Just when revolution
in India has become absolutely necessary, these opportunists say that it is
impossible. Your revolutionary experience has shown that this brand of
opportunism is nothing but pure cynicism and defeatism. The very categories
of “Ends” and “Means” have always been entirely alien to revolutionary
Marxism. An “end” by definition, is a preferred outcome with vectored
activity to realize it. It should be superfluous to point out that revolutionary
Marxism very consciously distinguishes itself from utopianism by defining
revolutionary action as definitely not the adoption of a certain number of
ends  through  reasoning  and  will,  but  instead  is  the  relatively  simple
extrapolation of revolutionary praxis already at work in Indian history.

Revolutionary Indian Marxism does not promise heaven on earth but
instead posits the patient analysis of past and current events in India, as the
history of contending classes locked in struggle for supremacy in the context
of US imperialist domination. Precisely because it does not resort to pious
excuses of “ends” revolutionary Indian Marxism has never been able to
acknowledge the idealist thinking of “any and all means”. Because the
CPI(Maoist) has never stooped low to describing an idealized and rosy but
fictionalized future and never justified its daily deeds in terms of it, it is
clear that through you, revolutionary Indian Marxism has distinguished itself
through following socialist principles, consistently democratic centralist style
of work and fighting ~Ian. This is how we interpret your outstanding
revolutionary  activity  of  the  past  three  decades.  By  completing  this
unification, we are convinced that you have been guided by proletarian
principles distilled from the experience of the international working class in
general and Indian proletarian revolutionaries in particular. It is extremely
heartening  for  us  to  witness  how  well  the  CPI(Maoist)  has  actualised
revolutionary  consciousness  in  India  by  extrapolating,  specifying  and
redirecting the spontaneous praxis of the class conscious Indian proletariat
along its path to winning state power and hegemony.

September 2004 - August 2014  135

East  Indian  Defence  Committee  pledges  that  being  faithful  to  the
principles of proletarian internationalism, it will render all help and assistance
under any and all conditions, to the best of it ability to actualize the four
tasks set out in the Appeal by the CPI(Maoist) that are in conformity with
the East Indian Defence Committee Political Resolutions and ongoing work
in Canada.

Comrades, the East Indian Defence Committee has studied your “Appeal
to Indians Settled Abroad” in addition to your letter to our organization. As
you are aware, our organization is now more than 31 years old. We derive
our revolutionary legitimacy by leading the anti-racist struggles of the East
Indian community in Canada as well as placing this struggle in the broader
context of anti-imperialist and revolutionary proletarian struggles in advanced
capitalist countries.

As a mass organization we are enthusiastic in extending our hand of
assistance to you. We will be guided in practice by the principles of proletarian
internationalism as reflected in our thirty year long support for the struggles
of the people of Vietnam, Palestine, South Africa and other nations and
now the heroic resistance in Iraq and Afghanistan fighting against imperialist
and neo-colonial domination. We will be also guided by the principles
enshrined in the East Indian Defence Committee Political Programme and
its Aims and Objectives. These are to defend the East Indian community in
Canada against racist attacks, support People’s Democratic revolution in
India and organize political, sports and cultural events for uniting the entire
East  Indian  community  in  Canada.  In  this  work,  East  Indian  Defence
Committee has been united with the struggles of the Canadian working
class and people.

After the events of 9/11, the ruling circles of the imperialist countries
have imposed the heavy hand of political police backed by the fabric of
draconian laws such as Bill C-36, which have exposed all the grim and ugly
features of real dictatorship under monopoly capitalism and imperialism.
Racial profiling, which is a form of pre-emptive attack on our community,
has become very widespread. Before 9/11, East Indian workers in Canada,
were suppressed by racist practices to be restricted to the lowest paying
jobs. The vast majority of East Indian workers in Canada work at the

136   Internatioal Messages and Statements

minimum wage. This racial discrimination is extended to housing, education
and access to government services. Now the new form of racist attacks is
racial profiling. Perversely, racial profiling is being used by ruling circles to
select their own collaborators in our community. As the crisis of racially
motivated state sponsored attacks reaches a crescendo, these collaborators
are trotted out to target communities to pacify the justified anger felt in our
community.

People in the East Indian community believe that just as in the 1970’s
and 1980’s East Indian Defence Committee organised around the correct
line of “Self Defence Is the Only Way”, that we will now provide, under
new conditions, such guidance and leadership by example. We are now
working out new tactics of how to best defend our community. Historical
experience has brought us many friends and allies. In this we salute the
heroic  fighters  in  the  black  community  who  have  for  many  decades,
experienced and fought against racial profiling. Racial profiling is so well
known in the black community that they use the commonly understood
term “Driving While Black” to measure its horribly dehumanising effects
which range from murderous atrocities to mass arrests.

Comrades, the South Asian diaspora is very widespread. From large
settlements in Guyana, South America, throughout the Carribean Islands
including Trinidad-Tobago to small settlements in Mexico, Brazil and
Argentina and then large settlements in Canada and the US of A. It extends
to almost every country of Africa with concentrations in South Africa and
the three countries of East Africa, namely Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda.
The Indian diaspora vends its way to the outer islands of the Indonesian
littoral all the way to Fiji and back to the mainland of Asia with large
settlements in Malayasia and smaller ones in Thailand, Kampuchea and
Vietnam. Today there are large settlements of Indians in the Arab countries
from Morocco to Yemen. In metropolitan Europe, very large populations
of Indian origin are settled in Britain. There are smaller numbers in Italy,
Germany, France and Holland. With still smaller numbers in the Scandinavian
countries and southern Europe namely Greece, Spain and Portugal. This
extensive geography of the Indian diaspora is mainly caused by oppressive
demands for cheap labour and maximum exploitation of immigrants in
imperialist countries and their colonies. This inevitably leads progressive
September 2004 - August 2014  137

Indians (and South Asians) to forge close alliances with and become part of
the advanced working class in their countries of residence. Where Marxist-
Leninist parties are functioning, this unity is a straight forward task. In
countries where such parties do not exist, the task is much more complicated.
You have rightly acknowledged in your letter to us and Appeal, the
proud memories that Indians settled abroad have of the Hindustani Ghadar
Party which led the anti-British struggle abroad from 1900 up until 1947. In
the light of the terrible conditions afflicting the people of India today, that
uncompleted task of contributing to the genuine independence and freedom
of the Indian people by winning the People’s Democratic revolution has to
be developed to a new stage with dedication, energy and self-sacrifice.

This then is the ambit of our current activity. In developing our work,
we are always seeking to unite with the class conscious revolutionary
proletariat in Canada. We look forward to the day when Canadian working
class and people give rise to a genuine Marxist-Leninist Party again and
liquidationism is defeated in the Canadian communist movement. The East
Indian Defence Committee has suffered greatly by the betrayal of one such
liquidator  who  was  in  the  National  Executive  of  East  Indian  Defence
Committee. Insitutional assets worth many millions of dollars and which
were the concentrated result of the sacrifices of East Indian workers in
Canada over two decades, were liquidated, in blatant violation of many
resolutions of the National Council and National Executive of the East
Indian Defence Committee. This was a major setback to our work. The
18th Convention of EIDC in Vancouver on March 1995, passed resolutions
severing  all  relationship  with  Marxist-Leninist  Party  of  Canada  and
denounced  that  organization  as  counter-revolutionary,  with  a  social-
democratic programme organized on revisionist and opportunist ideology.
The 19th Convention was the turning point in the work of our organization
against the liquidators. The leadership of the East Indian Defence Committee,
is working out its tactical line to emerge successfully from this very heavy
setback.

All  the  five  organization  referred  to  earlier  did  uphold
Marxism_Leninism-Mao Tse Tung Thought from 1968 to 1978. Since its
founding in 1973, East Indian Defence Committee was a mass organisation
associated with the Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada. In 1978, that Party
138   Internatioal Messages and Statements

along with the Communist Party of Brazil, Albanian Party of Labour and
many other parties and organizations took a stand against Mao Tse Tung
Thought and condemned it as guiding principles of present day Marxism-
Leninism. Along with other mass organizations of the Marxist-Leninist Party
of Canada, East Indian Defence Committee also passed a resolution against
Mao Tse Tung Thought in 1978.

As part of building relations with your organization on the basis of
proletarian internationalism, we are continuing our work to re-examine that
1978 resolution. Our review of that resolution in the light of current events,
the balance of forces against imperialism and the life experience of the
international proletariat in the period 1978 to 2004, both retrospectively
and looking ahead, should be complete sometime in 2005. We shall make
the necessary effort to inform you of the results of our review.

In 1978, East Indian Defence Committee was participant in the decision
to send the most resolute communists cadres back to India with a clear
mandate that in the absence of one unified party they should work with all
groups and organizations which support line of Charu Mazumdar and the
Naxalbari Way. In December 2000, on the occasion of the celebration of
the  75 Anniversary  of  the  Communist  Party  of  India  in  Kanpur,  this
organization the Communist Ghadar Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) passed
resolutions which clearly departed from the fundamental principles of
Marxist-Leninist practice in India. At this time our organization is engaged
in reviewing their work from 1978 until today. This review is ongoing and
will be completed in 2005.

In the meantime we shall make every effort to build closer links with
you on the basis of proletarian internationalism and render such assistance
which is in conformity with our organizational principles, goals and our
daily  work.  For  now  some  thirty  years,  the  many  splits  in  the  Indian
communist movement inevitably found their reflection in the large number
of progressive groups and individuals in the Indian community in Canada.
We pledge that the East Indian Defence Committee, in the process of
completing its programmatic goals, will work with every one of these
progressive individuals and groups to build a broad front in support of
Peoples Democratic revolution in India led by the CPI(Maoist).

To,
Comrade Ganapathy,
Secretary,
Communist Party of India (Maoist)

Dear Comrade,
Red Salutes!

Thank you very much for your letter dated November 1,2004, informing
us of the great news that CPI(ML)[PW] and MCCI have forged a complete
unity and both have resolved to work under one banner, that of the newly
formed  Communist  Party  of  India  (Maoist).  The  news  of  the  two
organisations working together as a united force was received here with
great jubilation. This was long awaited and desperately needed by the
oppressed and exploited masses of India. Such unity has always been at the
forefront of our wishes to the Indian revolutionaries and indeed a cherished
desire of the Maoist revolutionaries.

The arduous work undertaken by yourselves resulting in the formation
of a united Party is a fitting tribute to Comrade Charu Mazumdar, Comrade
Kanai Chatterjee and countless other peoples’ heroes who gave there lives
advancing the Naxalbari struggle. We are sure that this unity will consolidate
the  Marxist-Leninist-Maoist  ranks,  strengthen  the  People’s  Liberation
Guerrilla Army  (PLGA)  and  greatly  advance  the  cause  for  the  New
Democratic Revolution in India.

We recognise the formation of CPI (Maoist) as an historic event, one
which is worthy of celebration. We sincerely hope you will understand that
at the same time, we are mindful not to be overly euphoric and would see it
prudent to exercise a degree of cautious optimism. To exaggerate the size
of unity either in writing or in speech could give the unhelpful impression of
superiority, thereby driving a wedge against developing further unity. Adopting
the view point that others will have to joins us or wither away, could reinforce

September 2004 - August 2014  141

the existing divisions within the broad spectrum of ML movement in India.
Such tendency could cause far reaching damage and plunge the Indian
revolutionary movement decades backwards. This must not be allowed to
happen, if the unity which you have painstakingly brought about is to bear
further fruit.

Your Party’s recognition that unification of the Maoist is yet to be
completed and your endeavor to make speedy efforts to embrace others
are most welcome and we feel very necessary. It is our view that the onus
falls on all revolutionaries to adopt a common political line and unite as one
formidable revolutionary force. We do feel however that, it is incumbent
on the bigger organisations such as your Party to take the lead in creating
such unity. We believe there are a large number of other genuine ML
organisations in India with whom unity should be possible, given the will
and magnanimity on all sides. We are confident that if such moves are
made with sincerity, as is being promised by your Party, then this new
chapter in the Indian revolution will see the development of major advances
towards securing the New Democratic Revolution in India.

We acknowledge that there are genuine revolutionary forces that have
fallen victim to rightist opportunism, who have put armed struggle on the
back burner, albeit temporarily. Whilst we appreciate that it may not be
possible for you to unite with such forces at party level, at the same time
we believe they should not be classed as enemy. Such forces should be
united with and embraced when tackling broad issues, for the common
cause, in mass political campaigns. We recall MR2004 in Bombay, where
many organisations of all sorts of descriptions were invited to attend and
yet many of the ML organisations were given less than token consideration.
That important event, in our view, was a good opportunity to pull together
most ML groups, into a broad front and forge closer links, which was most
regrettably missed. Again such short comings were apparent in the October
2004 Kolkata rally. To continue in this manner would be to negate some of
the most important lessons that should be learnt from the past mistakes.

Regarding the tasks you have requested from us. As Marxist-Leninist
we are duty bound to support all proletarian struggles throughout the world.
Our organisation has a particular affinity with the Indian revolutionary

142   Internatioal Messages and Statements

movement and popularising it in the UK, lending solidarity and support to it
is a prominent part of our program, one which we endeavor to carry out.
Comrade, the Association of Indian Communists (ML) in Britain whole
heartedly congratulates PW and MCCI for having achieved a major unity
and uniting under one banner, that of CPI (Maoist). We celebrate your
unity. This represents a major gain for the oppressed and the exploited
Indian masses. It sounds a death knell to the bourgeois and imperialist
forces operating in India. We look forward to seeing this unity extending
further and to seeing peoples’ struggle securing new victories in the days to
come.

We  extend  our  warmest  revolutionary  greetings  to  you  and  every

We were deeply shocked by the news of passing away of Comrade

well as the international communist movement. Even though we did not
have the honor to meet comrade K.S. in person but being an old timer from

knew him well from afar and had deep affection for him.

Comrade KS laid down his life for emancipation of the workers and
peasants and peoples in India and around the world. He and other martyred
communist leaders will be for ever in our minds and will inspire us in our
battles  for  achieving  proletarian  revolution  in  Iran  and  world  wide

Dear comrade general secretary,: please accept our heart felt condolences
for this grave loss and convey our solidarity to the comrades in CC (P), the
entire rank and file of CPIM and PLGA, as well as to the family of comrade
K.S.

As you have called for in your letter of condolences of  November 3,

Central Committee (Provisional)
Communist Party of India (Maoist)
Dear Comrades,

It was with great sadness that we learned of the death of Comrade Shamsher

Singh Sheri.

Comrade Sheri struggled over many decades in the glorious cause of
communism. Although his area of practical activity for most his life was the
state of Punjab, he never lost sight of the ultimate goal of revolution in India and
all over the world. We have no doubt that his loss will be great to the Indian
revolution.

Comrade Sheri was well known to us as a comrade with a thoroughgoing
proletarian internationalist orientation. He had played a significant role in helping
to popularise the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement in India and in fighting
for the unity of the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist forces in India and on a world scale.
We also appreciate the attention Comrade Sheri devoted to studying Marxism-
Leninism-Maoism and developing theoretical work.

At a time when the challenges and opportunities are intensifying all over the
world, there is a clear-cut need for communists leaders to be bold in fighting
for Marxist-Leninist-Maoism and to learn from and engage with the understanding
and experience that emerges from all corners of the world. Comrade Sheri is a
fine example of this.

We are sure that the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and the whole
communist movement in India will honour the memory of Comrade Sheri by
learning from his proletarian internationalism, his selfless dedication to the
masses of the  people and his efforts to  grasp and apply Marxism-Leninism-
Maoism.

Please extend our condolences to Comrade Sheri’s family as well as to the

comrades of your party.

paramilitary gangs ordered by the West Bengal government against the
fighting peasants and adivasis in Lalgarh, West Midnapor. The administration
in Kolkata, in collaboration with the federal state and police forces have
surrounded villages and rural areas, exercising brutal violence and have
launched a huge tide of state terror, arrests, detentions and killings, aiming
to wear down the resistance of poor peasants and adivasis in order to
implement the land-grabbing policy of their lands by the multinational
corporations. They have the impertinence to characterize as terrorists the
revolutionaries, who under the leadership of the Communist Party of India
(Maoist), fight in the forefront of this just struggle against the pro-imperialist
policies of the Kolkata and New Delhi governments. The Communist Party
of Greece (marxist-leninist) calls all the progressive people across the world
to express their solidarity to the struggle of the poor peasants and adivasis
in West Bengal and demand to stop the military assault that has been launched
in the most brutal way.

INITIATIVE AGAINST WAR ON PEOPLE IN INDIA
21-11-2009
As the Indian government is stepping up the military repression against
the liberation movement of the adivasis (the native people and lowest castes)
led by the Maoists (Naxalites), a broad defence front is in the making. It is
supported by renowned personalities like Arundhati Roy and others. (See
the open letter to PM Manmohan Singh and its list of endorsers. ) As Anti-
imperialist Camp we do not only support and join the initiative but will
actively engage in spreading it across the world. However is ready to co-
operate is requested to contact us.

The Indian government has deployed 100,000 troops in addition to the
existing paramilitary and police forces in parts of central India, including
Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Jharkhand, Maharashtra Lalgarh - Jungalmahal
area of Bengal -- a vast area   inhabited by mainly tribal people. Forces are
being withdrawn from Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast to join
battalions of CRPF commandos, the ITBP, the CoBRA and the BSF. There
is also talk of bringing in the Rashtriya Rifles – a paramilitary force that is
directly guided by the Indian Army created especially for counter-insurgency
work known for its notoriety in Kashmir and Northeast in the past few
decades, and the purchase of bomb trucks, bomb blankets, bomb baskets,
and sophisticated new weaponry. The Air Force has already been deployed
and a full-scale air operation is in the offing.

Prior to this military build up in these regions a sort of hysteria about
the ‘deteriorating internal security environment due to Maoist threat’ is
being created in an attempt to manufacture consent for this war on the
Indian people. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh repeatedly stated that ‘left
wing extremism’ was the gravest internal security threat.   This raises a
basic question - Why does the state need to go to war against its most
deprived,  impoverished  and  oppressed  population,  and  inside  its  own
territory?

Central and eastern parts of India are rich in mineral wealth that can be
sold to the highest bidder. All that stands between politicians/ big money
bags and this wealth is the tribal people and their refusal to consent to their
designs. Addressing  a  conference  of  heads  of  different  paramilitary,

September 2004 - August 2014  147

intelligence and police forces a month ago, Manmohan Singh stated that the
mineral resources in the regions of tribal people remained untapped due to
resistance, which affected the foreign investment. The Fifth Schedule of
the Constitution grants tribals complete rights over their traditional land and
forests and prohibits private companies from mining on their land. In the
name of fighting the Maoists, the state wants to evacuate the entire area of
the tribals and force them into the ‘relief camps’, so that the land and
forests can easily be handed over to the multi-nationals. This is not new -
the new economic policy, since 1991, has repeatedly attacked whatever
little access the poor had to forests, land, rivers, common pastures, village
tanks and other common property resources. In each case this was justified
in the name of development, whether as Special Economic Zones (SEZs)
or mining, industrial park. In each case it was the poor who lost their land
and livelihood. For instance, in Niyamgiri, Orissa, home to several Dongria
tribes, land has been handed over to multinational companies like Vedanta
and in Jagatsinghpura to POSCO or in Kalinganagar to Tatas resulting in
deprivation. The rulers have been displaying absolute disregard to the strong
resistance of the people.

However,  there  are  voices  of  dissent  against  oppression  and
dispossession. In recent years, people throughout the country with or without
Naxalites including Maoists, are fighting to defend land and resources. So
far, valiant resistance by the tribal and other deprived sections of people
have prevented government-backed corporations from making inroads in
the mineral rich central India. But desperate to gain control of valuable
resources, the government, at the behest of big corporations, has now
planned a full-scale war on people who are fighting a battle of survival. The
stated objective of current offensive, ‘internal security’, is nothing but a
smoke-screen to cover this loot.

The state has tried to crush all popular resistance, armed or not, in the
past as well. It has ignored resistance. Without use of arms -- be   it in
Bhopal or the ‘Narmada Bachao’ movement. Various human rights activists
who have spoken out against such policies have also been time and again
targeted by the state. It has also brutally assaulted protesters in Singur/
Nandigram/ Lalgarh and Khammam. Like every counter insurgency operation
since 1947 this war will also lead to death of huge number of people - many
lives will be lost and many more will be rendered homeless. Once more a

148   Internatioal Messages and Statements

war will be fought in our name and against our own people.

The Home Minister Chidambaram after his visit to US stated that the
objective of the military offensive in the tribal regions is to ‘conquer, hold,
and develop’, borrowing a phrase from the US General’s statement on
Afghanistan. This statement from the Home Minister shows the real intention
this present war of Indian Government on its own citizens.

The state’s war on movements in Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Jharkhand
and other adjacent regions also entails a further shrinking of already limited
spaces for democratic dissent and articulation of pro-people development
paradigms. In the guise of this war the state is planning to come down on all
peoples’ struggles. Any organisation protesting against the policies of the
state can be labelled as a threat to ‘internal security’. To understand the
politics and economics of the current state offensive, we urge people to
look beyond the current hype being built by the government and its pliable
media.

We need to collectively raise our voice against this attempt of the
government to hand over the people’s resources by brutally suppressing all
political dissent.

We propose to take up the following demands in the light of the above
mentioned  background  and  come  together  as  platform  of  people’s
organisations and democratic individuals.

1. The military offensive against CPI (Maoist) and other revolutionary
parties and organisations and including tribal people in the regions of
Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Jharkhand, Gadchiroli and West Bengal should
be immediately stopped.

2. No to use of Army and Air Force against the people. All military,
paramilitary, Air Force, and special police forces should be withdrawn
from these regions.

3. The people’s resistance, armed or unarmed, against the exploitation of
natural resources should be taken into account politically. The hundreds
of Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) made for mining and other
industrial projects in these regions should be immediately cancelled.
4. Demands and issues of the people in different regions should be settled

A  Message of Solidarity from

Cordillera Peoples Alliance, the Philippines

2009

Dear Comrades and Friends,

The for the Defense of the Ancestral Domain and for Self Determination,
an independent federation of progressive peoples’ organizations, mostly
grassroots-based organizations among indigenous communities in Northern
Luzon Cordillera, Philippines, hereby endorses the statement against the
Indian government’s plans for launching an unprecedented military offensive
by army and paramilitary forces in the adivasi (indigenous people)-populated
regions of Andhra Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Orissa
and West Bengal states.

We are in solidarity with the indigenous peoples and movements opposing
this  plan  which  would  result  in  massive  human  rights  violations  and
oppression of the advasi and democratic sectors if this plan is pushed through.
What is happening there in India especially in indigenous territories is very
real here as militarization and military terrorism in indigenous communities
in the Philippines and political repression continue under the US-Arroyo
regime’s Oplan Bantay Laya (“operation plan defend freedom”) resulting
in the killing of more than a thousand activists and human rights advocates,
hundreds of victims of enforced disappearance, and thousands of people
and communities affected. Our situation is the same, hence, our solidarity
has become more urgent and strengthened.

We are with you in your struggle against state terrorism and fascism.

In solidarity,

of the indigenous people of India and the violation of their rights.

With deep concern we follow the news about the military operations directed
against the Adivasis living in the entire forested regions of central and eastern
India, we hear of massive military and paramilitary forces with sophisticated

Adivasi citizens of India.

We support the peoples rights to live in peace in accordance with their
traditions in their forests and on their land as guaranteed in the constitution of
India, we have received verified reports on police brutality against Adivasis.
organisations like salwa Judum have been installed to split tribal unity and
intimidate peace-loving forest-dwellers and villagers through acts of violence,
women, children and the aged have been their prime victims.

We fully support the initiative of the “Forum Against war on People”
We in Germany have experienced in our own history how our nation was
split in Suppressors and victims, suffering, death and destruction was the result
for millions of innocent people, we know only too well the results of the
militarization of the state and of society.

We thank you for the invitation to your ‘Convention Against War on People’.
It would have been a great honour for us to send a delegate to your convention
on the 4"th of December 2009 to New Delhi, but the notice was too short. May

PEOPLE’S STRUGGLES (ILPS) - CANADA

1-2-2010

ILPS-Canada Demands an End to Operation Green Hunt

and the Massive Displacement of People in India

Indian government threatens to eradicate

popular resistance by March 2010 !

In late 2009 the Indian government unleashed massive war against its
own people under the code name “Operation Green Hunt” involving the
deployment of 70,000 military and paramilitary troops in the so-called “Red
Corridor” that runs through parts of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chattisgarh,
Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal states.
It’s the latest in a series of efforts by the Indian government, labeled
the “biggest democracy in the world” by Canada and other western powers,
to impose “military solutions” on deep-seated social, political and economic
problems,and to clear the way for local and trans-national corporations to
plunder this region’s resources. Most of the riches sit on or under land
occupied by the poorest populations in India, including the adivasis — the
indigenous or tribal peoples.

Hundreds of agreements and Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs)
that allow free plunder of people’s resources have already been concluded
by mining and other corporations with the central and state government
and Special Economic Zones for multinational corporations have been
established. The only barrier that now stands between the local and trans-
national corporations and their prize is people’s resistance, both unarmed
and in some instances, armed.

During this military-economic offensive, Indian government is actively
ignoring its own Constitution and laws such as PESA and the Forest Rights
Act and targetting anyone who dares to speak out against this state repression
as a “potential terrorist”.

152   Internatioal Messages and Statements

However, from Nandigram to Niyamgiri, Lalgarh to Dandakaranya,
Koraput to Lalinganagar, Dadri to Narayanpatna, people have refused to be
mere victims of state-sponsored politics of liberalism, privatization and
imperialist globalization (LPG) in the name of “development”.

As a result of Operation Green Hunt and renewed aggressions in Lalgarh,
hundreds of thousands have been displaced, and the number of burnt villages,
persons displaced, injured, arrested or “disappeared” has skyrocketed. Many
have been placed in so-called “security camps” similar to the practice in
Sri-Lanka,  where  the  government  in  Colombo,  with  the  backing  of
Washington and other western powers, bloodily attacked the Tamil population
in early 2009.

In a letter to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, dated October
12, 2009, Indian and foreign intellectuals, including Booker Prize-winning
author Arundhati Roy and American political activist Noam Chomsky,
charged that the government’s offensive was “an attempt to crush democratic
and popular resistance against dispossession and impoverishment” and a
move that seemed to be geared towards facilitating the entry and operation
of “large corporations and paving the way for unbridled exploitation of the
natural resources and people in the affected regions”.

Arundhati Roy said, “This is a war waged by the army and paramilitary
forces for the super rich corporations against the super poor of India, who
have been driven to rebel and resist by years of injustice and mistreatment.”
Roy continued: “The Government doesn’t give the people anything else
than violence and disrespect. And now they want to take away from them
the last thing they have, their land”.

The purported aim of the Indian government is to clear this heavily
forested area of resistance forces, including Maoists and other Naxalite
organizations. Maoists — also known as Naxalites after Naxalbari district in
West Bengal state where they first led a peasant uprising against landlords
in 1967 — have a strong presence in this region. The members of the
Communist Party of India (CPI - Maoist) the political wing of the Maoists,
are now estimated by mainstream Indian media to be 20,000 strong.

The focus of Operation Green Hunt is the Maoist or “Red Corridor”
which stretches from West Bengal in India’s northeast through the states of
September 2004 - August 2014  153

Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra in the
west. It includes many forest areas including the Dandakaranya forest. Its
millions of adivasis were pushed into forest regions by waves of invaders
and generally excluded from mainstream Hindu society. They have a long
history of rebellion and militant uprisings against British colonial rule starting
in the 19th Century and have been a major base for communist organizing.
The forests where the adivasis are concentrated have abundant mineral
wealth (iron, coal, bauxite, manganese, corundum, gold, diamonds and
uranium). Over the last years foreign and Indian corporations, with the
protection of the Indian state apparatus, have been exploiting these resources
and violently suppressing the local people in the process.

The Communist Party of India (Maoist) has been active in this area
since the 1970s, following the Naxalbari rebellion. The Maoists have helped
lead the tribals in their struggles for just demands for land and opposition to
police and military repression. The Maoists have support among the Muslim
population and the Dalits (often referred to as “untouchables”). They have
helped organize the people to improve subsistence agricultural methods,
build wells and schools and struggle against backward feudal practices.

For years the Indian elite left this area in dire poverty and profited from
the cheap labour which migrated all over India searching for work. Now,
realizing the vast riches that lay in and beneath the vast forests of this
region, the Indian ruling elite, with backing from the U.S. and other forces,
is trying to clear the way for a new wave of foreign investment to plunder
the regions’ resources.

The Indian government claims that by March 2010 they hope to have
eradicated the Maoists and anyone who dares to support them and resists
the government’s armed presence. According to the Indian state, tens of
thousands of government “security personnel” will combat “against 6,000-
7,000 armed Maoist cadres”.

The military offensive has been accompanied by illegal arrests and
detainment of progressive leaders in the area, such as Raja Sarkhel and
Prasun Chatterjjee, by the reactionary forces, under the CPI (Marxist), an
organization apparently Communist in name only, and the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP). Activists have been heavily tortured to try to force them to

154   Internatioal Messages and Statements

give false testimonies against fellow activists.

Progressive Indian political leader Kobad Ghandy was also abducted,
illegally detained and tortured for three days and nights while deprived of
medicine and medical treatment for life-threatening health problems. The
Committee for the Release of Political Prisoners (CRPP) has been actively
campaigning for the immediate release of Ghandy and an immediate end to
all illegal arrests and detentions and human rights abuses.

Operation Green Hunt follows on the heels of the vast offensive against
the people of Lalgarh-Jangalmahal in West Bengal starting June 2009. An
All-India Fact Finding Team which was organized by progressive forces to
look into the atrocities being committed by the West Bengal government
was prevented from reaching Lalgarh. The members of the fact-finding
team were arrested, maltreated and detained. An international team of
Amnesty International was also prevented from entering Lalgarh.

The International League of Peoples Struggle Canada chapter (ILPS-
Canada), and its member organizations and allies, support the call of the
Indian  people  to  demand  that  their  government  immediately  and
unconditionally withdraw its armed forces engaged in the military-paramilitary
offensive against the oppressed adivasi people of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand,
Orissa, Maharashtra, Bengal, Karnataka and other regions.

Furthermore, we support the Indian people who are demanding that
their government take concrete measures to stop the plunder of the people’s
land, forests, hills and rivers by Indian and multinational corporations. This
requires the scrapping of hundreds of MoUs signed by the central and state
governments with various corporations who plan exploit natural resources
at the expense of the poor and marginalized citizens of India.

We also extend our solidarity and support to the struggle of the tribal

people in Lalgarh-Jangalmahal.

We join the people of India in demanding:
- an immediate end to Operation Green Hunt and the withdrawal of all

military and paramilitary forces;

- an immediate end to the “Lalgarh Operation” against the tribal people
of Lalgarh-Jangal mahal and the withdrawal of all military and police-

- the closing of all “internment” camps;
- the immediate release of all political prisoners;
- the Indian government provide due compensation to the people
displaced and impacted by Operation Green Hunt and Operation
Lalgarh, and punish those military, para-military and police officials
responsible for violence, rape, loot and other crimes;

INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST
WAR ON THE PEOPLE OF INDIA (ICAWPI)

3-2-2010

Dear friends,

The International Campaign Against War on the People of India
(ICAWPI) is now ready to be launched to work as a coordinating centre
seeking international support for the resistance of the people of India
against the all out military offensive of the Indian state against its own
citizens.

ICAWPI is an international extension of widespread opposition and
initiatives  against  this  genocidal  war  to  forcefully  crush  the  heroic
resistance of the tribal peoples in the heartlands of India and hand over
these  lands  rich  in  minerals  and  raw  materials  to  international
corporations such as Vedanta.

This overt war serving to facilitate the looting of the land by Indian
and international corporations for fabulous profits and the destruction
of the livelihood of the countless numbers of the poorest of the poor in
India is branded “Operation Green Hunt”. While in different regions of
the country the same operation may be named differently, the Indian
state shamelessly tries to hide this banditry against the people of India
and  utterly  open  servitude  to  the  imperialism  as  “war  against  the
Naxalites”—  imposing  a  severe  reign  of  terror  and  repression  on
progressive and democratic forces and individuals everywhere across
the country.

Countless intellectuals, authors, film makers, academics, and other
professionals such as lawyers and doctors who abhor the Indian state’s
total lies and open disregard for civil and human rights have joined
mass gatherings and rallies and various forums in India in order to raise
their own voices and join forces to oppose the State and to defend the
just cause of the oppressed tribal people in India.

In the course of this gathering movement countless people have
been arrested and imprisoned. Untold suffering and restrictions have

September 2004 - August 2014  157

been imposed on the people.

Yet, international public opinion is kept grossly in the dark about these
issues while the mainstream media continue to follow and repeat the Indian
State’s claims that “India is the largest democracy in the world” and that
the Maoists, as the biggest security threat to this “democracy” must wiped
out at all costs.  Thus they justify their silence and bless the Indian State in
perpetrating these crimes in the name of a “war on terror”.

The ICAWPI aims to reach out to all democratic and freedom loving
people across the world concerned about the plight of the people in India to
unite and take initiative to break this silence internationally and to rally
much needed support and solidarity to the just struggles of the people of
India.

Further information on Operation Green Hunt and the struggles of the
people are available through www.icawpi.org - a website designed to carry
material related to this issue and the campaign.

We request all democratic and progressive formations to take initiative
and coordinate their efforts with ICAWPI. All reports of actions, meetings
and letters of solidarity and concern will be published at this site.

In order to launch this campaign and rally the support and solidarity of
the  progressive  forces  abroad,  ICAWPI  calls  on  everyone  to  join
demonstrations and protest actions in front of Indian embassies and consulates
on February 5, 2010 where ever possible. A list of organized events will be
published on the website as they become available. Further actions, events
and meetings are being planned and will be announced soon after.

The website will also publish a list of clubs, associations and meeting
places in Europe and elsewhere, for contact and discussion about the issue
and to find ways of raising local awareness and take common joint action.
Please contact the ICAWPI through info@iwapi.org  to inform us of

your proposals to bring the campaign to your area.

Bayan/ILPS Philippine Chapter Urge

Indian Govt to Stop its Operation Green Hunt

5-2-2010

The Bagong Alyansang Makabayan and the ILPS Phil.Chapter today,
Feb. 05, 2010,  picketed near the Indian Embassy in Makati City to demand
that “the Indian government immediately and unconditionally withdraw its
armed forces engaged in the military-paramilitary offensive called Operation
Green Hunt, against the adivasi ( indigenous ) people of Chhattisgarh,
Jharkhand, Orissa, Maharashtra, Bengal, Karnataka and other regions of
this populous country.”

Alarmed by the growing resistance movement of the adivasi in many
parts of India, the government has unleashed Operation Green Hunt that
has seen the burning of houses of adivasi, the targetting and killings of
unarmed civilians, the torture-detention-killings of mass leaders of progressive
organizations

Last year, Bayan and the ILPS Phil. Chapter, picketed near the Indian
Embassy to protest the militarization and violations of human rights of the
adivasi in Orissa where a large tract of land would be cleared for a sprawling
factory for the cheap locally-made Indian car called Tata.

“Bayan and the ILPS Phil. Chapter demand that the Indian government
immediately stop the plunder of vast tracts of land and forested areas for
large scale mining and industrial projects in special economic zones. Vast
areas within India, both rich agricultural fields and areas rich with minerals
like Jharkand, Orissa, Andra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and West Bengal, are
being exploited by the MNCs in collaboration with India’s top industrialists”
Rita Baua, Intl Solidarity Officer of Bayan and Vice-Chairperson of the
ILPS Phil. Chapter, said.

“Bayan and the ILPS Phil. Chapter likewise condemn  the impunity of
the Indian government towards the adivasi who are resisting their plunderous
activities. Already, 3 million of the adivasi have been displaced by Operation
Green Hunt. The adivasi people are the rightful owners of the land and the

September 2004 - August 2014  159

fruits of their hardship, not the Indian government which is pro-foreign
investors,” Baua said.

Bayan and the ILPS Phil. Chapter also called on the Indian government
for the immediate surfacing of two progressive and militant leaders, namely,
Mr. Ravi Sharma and Ms. Anuradha, who were forcibly taken from their
workplace and home, respectively.

“We fear that both leaders might have suffered tremendously from
torture and intimidation. We hope they have not yet been killed considering
that Mr. Sharma was arrested last October 10, 2009,” Baua noted.

“Bayan and the ILPS Phil.Chapter likewise condemn the Obama govt
for providing not only logistical support such as munitions and other war
materiel, latest military technology, but also US$18 billion;  providing military
advise on mapping the deployment of revolutionary forces on the ground,
and holding of joint US-India-Israel military exercises. Obama who got a
Nobel Peace Prize for Peace is a contradiction in terms as far as the genuine
peace in India is concerned” Baua said.

“We therefore demand that the Obama government stop its war of
terror against the adivasi and the people of India. The latter will not be
cowed by your weapons and political/military tactics meant to suppress
them,” Baua concluded.

Statement on India’s Operation Green Hunt

5-2-2010

We, in the various youth and student groups in the Philippines express
our condemnation at the intensifying attacks of the Indian government,
starting from the Central government down to the state governments in
pursuing  the  so-called  Operation  Green  Hunt,  its  counter-insurgency
operations purportedly directed primarily against the Communist Party of
India (Maoist).

From the start of the Operation it has become clear that the real targets
are not the Maoists alone but the resistance of the people of India against
the wanton and profit-driven operations of big multinational companies
backed by government and its military and police.

It has been reported that intensified militarization in the regions of Orissa,
Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and in the heroic Lalgarh had
further resulted to wider human rights violations. Illegal and unjust arrests,
forceful evacuation, torture, rape, and extra-judicial killings are being
committed by military, police and paramilitary without hesitation, in full
public view and with so much impunity.

The Operation Green Hunt is against the adivasis, farmers, ordinary
people especially in the remotest and poorest villages of India. The only
crime they have committed is to stand and prevent the profit-driven mining
and corporations in its operations which will destroy their livelihood and
plunder the environ and India’s natural resources.

We condemn the use of the Operation to flush out the adivasis and
farmers from their land and government’s building of concentration camps
of the displaced in order to pursue its Memorandum of Agreements (MOA)
with  various  mining  corporations.  We  demand  that  these  camps  be
immediately closed.

We demand that the Indian government withdraw heightened military
deployment in the countryside and halt its Operation Green Hunt, and balked
at pursuing anti-people projects which will only trample upon the basic
rights of Indian people.

We support the Indian youth and people in their legitimate resistance
against the systematic loot of India’s resources which deprive its own people
their life and livelihood, and their future.

APC Demands an End to Operation Green Hunt in India

The Asia-wide peasant group Asian Peasant Coalition (APC) lambasted
the Indian government’s massive war against its own people under the code
name  “Operation  Green  Hunt”  which  started  in  2009.  It  involves  the
deployment of 70,000 military and paramilitary troops in the so-called “Red
Corridor” that runs through parts of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chattisgarh,
Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal states.
Biplab Halim APC Chairperson, based in India said, “this is the latest in
a series of efforts by the Indian government  to impose “military solutions”
on social, political and economic problems we are facing. It also aims to
clear  the  way  for  local  and  trans-national  corporations  to  plunder  our
resources.”

“As a result of Operation Green Hunt and renewed aggressions in
Lalgarh, hundreds of thousands have been displaced, and the number of
burnt villages, persons displaced, injured, arrested or “disappeared” has
skyrocketed. Many have been placed in so-called “security camps” similar
to the practice in Sri-Lanka, where the government in Colombo, bloodily
attacked the Tamil population in early 2009" added Halim.

“The focus of Operation Green Hunt is the Maoist or “Red Corridor”
which stretches from West Bengal in India’s northeast through the states of
Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra in the
west. They have a long history of rebellion and militant uprisings against
British colonial rule starting in the 19th Century and have been a major
base for communist organizing,” remarked P. Chennaiah, APC deputy
secretary general who is also based in India.

“The Communist Party of India (Maoist) has been active in this area
since the 1970s, following the Naxalbari rebellion. The Maoists have helped
lead the tribals in their struggles for just demands for land and opposition to
police and military repression. They have helped organize the people to

September 2004 - August 2014  165

improve subsistence agricultural methods, build wells and schools and
struggle against backward feudal practices,” added P. Chennaiah.

The military offensive has been accompanied by illegal arrests and
detainment of progressive leaders in the area, such as Raja Sarkhel and
Prasun Chatterjjee, by the reactionary forces, under the CPI (Marxist), an
organization apparently Communist in name only, and the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP). Activists have been heavily tortured to try to force them to
give false testimonies against fellow activists.

“We can relate to the suffering of the Indian peasants as we, Filipino
farmers are also victims of the Arroyo government’s counter-insurgency
program Oplan Bantay Laya (Oplan Guard Freedom), that is composed
mainly  of  extra-judicial  killings  (EJK),  enforced  disappearances  and
accusations of fabricated charges.  Arroyo’s Oplan Bantay Laya resulted
561 peasant victims of extra-judicial killings, where 119 were KMP leaders,
129 peasant victims of enforced disappearances and scores are being held
for crimes they did not commit,” said Danilo Ramos, secretary general of
APC and Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP) who is baed in the
Philippines.

“The APC support and uphold the Indian people’s struggle for genuine
land reform, mainly advanced by the Naxalites and Indian peasants. We
call on our members in Asia to expose the brutality of the Indian government.
Let us hold protest actions at the Indian embassy in our respective countries
to pressure the Indian government to immediately end its Operation Green
Hunt, massive militarization and human rights abuses on Indian peasants
and people”, ended Ramos.

This morning, the KMP joined the International League of Peoples’
Struggle (ILPS)-Philippines in a picket in front of the Indian embassy in
Makati City. The protesters shouted, “End Operation Green Hunt in India!
Justice to victims of human rights violations in India! Struggle for genuine
land reform in India! Down with U.S. imperialism and puppetry of the

recently, in mid-January. Meanwhile we received.... a copy of your letter
addressing all revolutionary parties, on the need to unite against Operation
Green Hunt. As you know, we fully agree with this. The attitude you have
shown in that letter, as well as in the letter to us, is also very enthusing.

Due to our organisational situation we face some limitations in playing
a very active role in the movement against Green Hunt at the all-India level.
However our comrades are keeping in close touch. A message they sent to
the Delhi convention is enclosed with this letter. Earlier they had initiated
an all-India signature campaign. It gained good support but was blacked out
by the media, except in AP...

In your letter you have asked for suggestions on how the resistance
against Operation Green Hunt can be developed. We think that the most
important task to be taken up is broad propaganda on the achievements made
by  the  people  of  the  struggling  areas  through  the  people’s  war,  most
importantly about the new political power and society that is being built there,
about how the Adivasi masses in particular are in the forefront. This is very
much needed to expose the political context of the enemy’s suppression
campaign, highlight what is at stake in the struggle to defeat it, and unleash
revolutionary propaganda in all its possible strength. We firmly believe that
this is also important for the orientation of the broad resistance movement
itself. Obviously, the defence of the people’s war cannot be made the basis
of a broad resistance movement. But that doesn’t mean that this broad
resistance against Operation Green Hunt must be restricted to the matter of
the rich resources in that region or the human rights of the Adivasi people...

We are glad to see that, in your call as well as in the letter to us, you highlight
the fact that the issue involved is not just suppression of the revolutionary
movement. Ultimately it is a matter concerning all those opposing the anti-
people, pro-imperialist policies of the Manmohan government. It seems that
this realisation is now emerging among varied sections and strata of society
also. This underlies the unprecedented manner in which progressive, democratic
sections and personages have come forward to denounce the ‘War on the People’
and their refusal to be cowed down by the bogey of violence raised by the enemy.
For sure their realisation is still not so sharp or clear and is quite uneven. But it
carries the potential of powerfully promoting the task of building a really broad,
countrywide movement - going even beyond the resistance against Green Hunt -
uniting most of those resisting the government’s policies. We hope you will
consider this aspect too, while we organise the movement against the “War on
the People”.
Comrades,

We have recently discussed about the situation in the country and examined
various ways in which we can contribute in defending the people’s war led by
your party as well as in building a broad people’s resistance movement. We
concluded that while giving maximum effort on carrying out our revolutionary
tasks, including that of initiating people’s war in regions of our work, we must
also actively take up the task of party unity. In a situation where the people
themselves are realising the need to stand together, unification of Maoists is all
the more urgent. It will certainly give a big boost to all those who are joining the
resistance...

The determined stand and courageous fight put up by the PLGA, people’s
militia and the masses led by your party against the huge array of vicious forces
assembled by the enemy is a matter of great enthusiasm to all those desiring
revolution. Through you we salute the ranks of your party, the fighters of the
PLGA and people’s militia and the revolutioanry masses. We pledge to strive
with all our capacity to defend the people’s war and strengthen the resistance
against the enemy’s suppression campaign.

With Revolutionary Greetings,

Operation Green Hunt and the Revolution in India;

Genocidal war against the People’s Revolutionary Movement

“The armed movement in India inspires the people throughout the world
to stand up and fight. The CPP is ready to extend any help and support to
the Indian revolutionaries in order to further advance their struggle. This
is a part of the proletarian internationalist duty of Filipino communists.”
– CPP

The Communist Party of the Philippines, the Filipino people and the
revolutionary movement worldwide condemn “Operation Green Hunt”, a
counterrevolutionary war launched by the reactionary government of India
against the armed revolutionary movement and the national minorities within
the country. This conflict is part of the terrorist war led by the US in
various parts of the world, mostly in areas where the people are waging
courageous resistance.

Operation Green Hunt’s principal target are mineral-rich areas like West
Bengal,  Jharkhand,  Orissa,  Chhattisgarh, Andhra  Pradesh,  Bihar  and
Maharashtra. These places are also known as the “Red Corridor”, because
it  is  here  that  the  broad  and  advancing  revolutionary  war  led  by  the
Communist Party of India (Maoist) can be found. In the past couple of
years, numerous projects and operations in mining and other industries
were  delayed,  if  not  outrightly  cancelled  due  to  the  staunch  people’s
resistance in the area supported by the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army
and CPI(Maoist).

In these locations, iron, coal, gold, diamond, bauxite and uranium deposits
can be found. These areas have also been cited as ideal sites for setting up
special economic zones. Several mining agreements with local and foreign
capitalists have been approved by the reactionary Indian regime for these
sites.

September 2004 - August 2014  169

Many more areas already have companies operating there such as
Vedanta, Rio Tinto and Posco, companies that have long been plundering
the country’s natural resources.

In the past five years alone, the governments of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand,
Orissa and West Bengal have secretly made deals with local and foreign
companies for billions of dollars worth of contracts to construct steel, iron
and aluminum factories, power plants, dams and mines. In order to clear
the way for these projects, the people who are largely national minorities,
are being driven out and their organizations destroyed.
Operation Green Hunt

To counter the guerrillas’ strength, India’s central reactionary government
has begun the massive deployment of military forces to extensive areas in
the  states  of  West  Bengal  and  Orissa  where  it  has  been  conducting
widespread aerial bombings and using high-tech military equipment from
the US and Israel. The collusion between the reactionary regime in India
and US imperialism in Operation Green Hunt is crystal clear.

Under Operation Green Hunt, there have been worsening attacks on
the livelihoods and rights of the people in the affected areas. Already as
many as 20 million peas- ants have been driven from their farms as a result
of hamletting and zoning. Abuses such as torture and rape are rampant.
Many communities have been razed to the ground in order to banish residents
accused of being CPI-Maoist members or supporters. A large number of
the residents have been forced to live in guarded communities called “security
camps” where their mobility is restricted. They are also prohibited from
going to their farms and fields. Those who violate these rules are automatically
shot.

The victims are denied access to all legal means including the courts.
The media are alsobanned from entering and reporting what is transpiring
in the area. Organizations, media people, intellectuals, writers, cultural
workers and other progressive forces opposed to Operation Green Hunt
and supportive of the people’s resistance are persecuted and threatened.

In response, the CPI-Maoist is helping the people to organize and
strengthen themselves. They launch literacy and education campaigns by

establishing schools. They provide much-needed medical services. They
set up self-defense units and core forces to fight and overcome the attacks
and brutality of the state’s military and paramilitary forces being deployed
to crush the tribal communities.
Inspiration to the CPP and whole world

Revolutionaries and the CPP closely follow and laud the guerrilla war
and revolutionary movement in India. They hail their victories. Each of
their successes is a contribution to the struggle of the international proletariat,
and the CPP recognizes their complementary role in the development of
armed struggle in the Philippines and other communist and revolutionary
movements worldwide.

The armed movement in India inspires the people throughout the world
to stand up and fight. The CPP is ready to extend any help and support to
the Indian revolutionaries in order to further advance their struggle. This is
a part of the proletarian internationalist duty of Filipino communists.

From the CPP’s standpoint, the revolutionaries and communists in India
will likely be a major force in the advancement of the international proletarian
struggle due to the country’s size and the intensity that their people’s war
has already achieved. Chiefly, it is significant because it is under the correct
proletarian revolutionary guidance of a genuine communist party.

It has the potential to bring the international communist movement to a
new and higher level, as Russia did after World War I until the 1950s and
China after World War II until 1970.

The CPP considers the CPI-Maoist a fraternal party. There is a high
level of ideological unity between the two parties. These past few years,
they have had many opportunities to share ideas and practical experiences.
Also, they have attended many conferences where they both carried out
important tasks for the promotion of Marxism, Leninism and Maoism.

REVOLUTIONARY COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

Oppose Operation Green Hunt!

1-5-2010

In November 2009, the Indian government launched “Operation Green
Hunt.” This massive military assault targets millions of adivasis (ethnic and
tribal groups who were among the original inhabitants of the subcontinent).
The adivasis have a long history of rebellion and militant uprisings. The
forests where adivasis live have abundant mineral wealth (iron, coal, bauxite,
manganese, corundum, gold, diamonds and uranium). Over

the last years foreign and Indian corporations, with the protection of
the Indian state, have been exploiting and violently suppressing the people.
Two sides are shaping up in this struggle. On one side are the adivasis and
the Communist Party of India (Maoist), whose members have lived and
fought side by side with the adivasis since the 1970s. On the other side,
with  its  military  and  police  force,  is  the  central  Indian  state  —  the
representative and protector of the ruling classes that live off and suck the
life out of the Indian masses. The Indian state urgently wants to clear the
obstacles for a new wave of foreign investment and capitalist development
aimed at taking advantage of the region’s resources. And the rulers of India
are concerned by the deep ties the Maoists have made with the region’s
people.

A statement last year from prominent intellectuals opposing “Operation
Green Hunt” said, “Such a military campaign will endanger the lives and
livelihoods of millions of the poorest people living in those areas, resulting
in massive displacement, destitution and human rights violation of ordinary
citizens.”

The U.S. and India have a deep strategic relationship. In 2007, the
U.S. moved to bolster India’s nuclear capacity, and India and the U.S.
regularly conduct military exercises together. In the spirit of proletarian
internationalism — and as part of standing up against the crimes of “our”
government and oppressors aligned with it — “Operation Green Hunt”
must be protested and opposed by all who hate injustice and oppression.

Communist Party of the Philippines

Condemns  Summary Execution of Azad

Filipino People Join Indian People in

Condemning Execution of  Comrade Azad

The  Communist  Party  of  the  Philippines  (CPP)  and  all  Filipino
revolutionary forces join the Indian people in condemning the summary
execution of Comrade Azad (Cherukuri Rajkumar) and his companion
Comrade Hem Pandey (Jitender) by the fascist Indian police last July 2 in
the Adilabad jungles near the Maharashtra border, Andhra Pradesh.

Comrades Azad and Hem Pandey were en route to meet other comrades
in Nagpur District, Maharashtra when they were abducted by the notorious
Andhra Pradesh Special Branch Police. They were likely flown by helicopter
to the jungles where they were summarily executed.

To cover up its fascist crime, the Indian police claim that Comrade
Azad was killed in an armed encounter and to have recovered an AK-47
rifle at the scene. According to reports, Comrade Azad was traveling unarmed
when he was accosted. His killing was carried out by the Indian police in
cold blood and in complete disregard of international laws of war.

Comrade Azad  was  a  member  of  the  Central  Committee  of  the
Communist Party of India (Maoist) and served as its spokesperson. He
was a disciplined student of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism who dedicated three
and a half decades of his life to the revolutionary struggle of the Indian
people. He was well regarded for living a simple life and working hard for
the revolutionary cause. His death is mourned by the working class and
oppressed people of India, the Philippines and the world over.

The CPP pays the highest revolutionary tribute to Comrade Azad and
encourages all its members and revolutionary forces under its leadership to
read and study the life story of Comrade Azad and be inspired by his
revolutionary dedication.

The Communist Party of Greece (marxist-lennist) condemns the ongoing
murderous  crusade  of  the  Indian  repressive  forces,  both  official  and
paramilitary, against millions of peasants and Adivasi (tribal people) in central
India. The so-called “operation Green Hunt” that was jointly launched by
the Central Government in Delhi governments of Indian states like Andhra
Pradesh, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh etc, have turned into a bloodbath with
killings, mass arrests, tortures and displacements, moving populations and
whole villages is nothing short of a genocide. It aims to eliminate the armed
revolutionary  movement  and  to  serve  the  plans  of  the  multinational
conglomerates. Meanwhile with this escalation of the political violence and
terrorism against the cadres and the members of the revolutionary movement
of the country as well as the harassment and intimidation of every progressive
person that attempts to denounce these mass crimes continue to extend the
reign of fascist terror across the country. The last and characteristic incident
was the extrajudicial cold-blooded murder, of two cadres of the Communist

Service of Andhra Pradesh.

Expressing Solidarity with CPI (Maoist)

Let us Honour His Memory and Continue on His Path!

Comrade Azad  was  a  member  of  central  committee  and  also  a
member of the politbureau of the Communist Party of India (Maoist).
His death is a big loss for the CPI (Maoist), the Indian revolution, the
revolutions of the region, and also the global revolution. He would have
played a very critical and decisive role at the current juncture: at a time
when the reactionary Indian state on one hand has mobilized more than
250000 police and mercenary forces against the Maoist peoples war
within the framework of a large military campaign called Operation
Green Hunt, and on the other hand it is espousing a deceptive propaganda
about “peace talks” and “ceasefire.” His murder at the hands of Andra
Pradesh’s special forces, and that even in another state, which is even
illegal under the laws of the Indian state, illustrates the fact that the
reactionary state is using the false propaganda around “ceasefire” and
“peace talks” as a façade for hiding its anti-people brutal repression and
for this purpose they would even break their own laws. The resistance
of the masses under the leadership of CPI (Maoist) against “Operation
Green Hunt” that spreads across twenty states out of 28 Indian states is
a resistance against the comprador policies of the reactionary Indian
state which is making possible the vast plunder and pillage of the natural
resources of India by multinational corporations. In the process of the
ongoing resistance, which continuously expands and spreads, the masses
of people are selflessly giving sacrifices and also give tough blows to
the vicious and repressive forces of the reactionary state. The officials
of  the  reactionary  Indian  state  and  at  its  helm  the  Prime  Minister,
Manmohan Singh, since the last few years is continuously declaring
that the Maoist peoples war is the biggest threat to the Indian state.

Condemn the Murder of Comrade Azad

July 2010

Com. Azad (Cherukuri Rajkumar), Central Spokesperson of the Communist
Party of India (Maoist) was brutally murdered, along with comrade Hem Pandey
(Jitender), by the Andhra Pradesh Special Branch police, after arresting them
around 11 am on the 1st of July from Nagpur in Maharashtra. As usual the
police have concocted a story of an armed encounter during the night of 1st-2nd
July. The bodies of the slain comrades were taken to the jungles of Adilabad
District in Andhra Pradesh in order to prop up this ‘encounter scene’.

This illegal arrest, torture and killing once again underlines the murderous
nature of the Indian state and the scant value it attaches to its own laws and
constitution. According to law, the AP police have no authority whatsoever to
make an arrest in another State without prior information to its concerned
court, in this case in Nagpur, Maharashtra. The arrested had to be first produced
in a Nagpur court before taking them to AP. But when the murders were
reported, all the media pundits, upper courts and MPs, usually very vocal about
‘respect for law’, were careful to keep this blatant violation away from public
debate. This is not the first incident where the AP Special police, trained by the
hated Mossad, have made illegal arrests and killed revolutionaries in various
places outside their State. Obviously they have been given the green light by the
rulers in New Delhi to do as they wish. All those who are genuinely concerned
about the state of affairs in the country should step forward to build up a
consistent and powerful resistance to this killer regime.

Comrade Azad was playing an admirable role as spokesperson in these
days of enormous mispropaganda by the enemy. His death is particularly painful
blow to the Indian revolution. We dip the red flag in honour of these valiant
sons of the people, offer condolences to their families and express solidarity
with the Communist Party of India (Maoist) in this loss.

India is not the “shining” example of globalization and capitalism its
publicists claim. Indeed today there are more Indians living in poverty (456
million) than the entire population of India in 1947 (345 million).

 Independent India inherited a semi-feudal agrarian system from the
British.  Land  ownership  was  highly  concentrated  in  a  few  landlords
Zamindars and their intermediaries whose main objective was to extract
maximum rent, either in cash or kind from peasants. Congress under Nehru,
for all its reformist socialist rhetoric and its state capitalist measures, never
carried out a radical agrarian reform let alone a rural revolution. It is
noteworthy that the most far reaching (though gradual) land reform has
been in the states ruled by Communist Party governments or coalitions, i.e.
in West  Bengal,  Manipur  and  Kerala.  Recent  studies  prove  that  rural
inequalities have increased, rather than decreased.  The number of landless
laborers has gone up and the top ten percent of landowners monopolizes
more land now than in 1951.

But  there  are  strategic  weaknesses  within  the  Indian  communist
movement. The Indian working class and peasantry are struggling to improve
their living conditions and demanding social justice, but the reformist
leaderships of the CPI and CPM hold them back. The CPI and CPM are
both reformist parties, concentrating on parliamentary elections. When in
power in different regions they act in the interests of capital against the

when the CPM sent in party cadres to intimidate, rape and harass villagers
resisting privatization and in Manipur CPI Manipur state Committee directly

2-9 April 2011 - International Week of Support

In India the people’s war is intensifying day by day. Led by Communist
Party of India (Maoist), it involves and has the support of millions of poor
farmers, women, masses of untoucha- bles, and now controls about ten
States of the Confederation of India.

That’s a people’s war against poverty, feudal capitalistic exploitation, in
the regions where most acute are the contradictions produced by the turbulent
development of plundering re- sources, caste oppression and exploitation,
by the Indian capital linked to imperialism.

With the help and support of the imperialists and especially the American
imperialists, the Indian reactionary ruling classes are trying to suffocate the
revolutionary movement, carrying out huge atrocities, whose barbarism there
is no precedent.

The Indian government on behalf of imperialism describes the People’s
War as the greatest threat to internal security, and launched against it across
the country an unprecedented offen- sive, under the name of “Operation
Green Hunt” with a large deployment of ultra-armed tro- ops, Police and
paramilitary forces, trying to sow terror and genocide on the peoples of
India, through raids, indiscriminate destruction, rapes and mass murders,
arrests and disappearances, trying to assassinate the leaders, as occurred
with Comrade Azad, a top Maoist leaders of the CPI(M). All this with the
illusion of drowning in blood the struggle of a people for liberation.

But the Indian popular masses unite in the People’s War, giving rise to
large protests and strikes against rising prices, corruption and state terrorism.

their mass media support the criminal action of the Indian government; but
in these countries also grows complaint and solidarity.

At present, a new type of people’s movement and political upsurges are

have created a great revolutionary enthusiastic situation and inspiration in

favor of Marxism and once again it has proved the relevance, importance,

Now, the Marxists of all countries are uniting to make maximum effort
and to accelerate the Maoist movement of a new type in a new way. They
want to move the Maoist movement rapidly ahead in the revolutionary
direction. Recent upsurges have prepared a revolutionary atmosphere to
form Maoist parties in the Arab and African worlds. In the European context,
the Maoists of Italy have done tremendous work in this field. And we all

suppressing the national libration movement of the Indian people. India is
the number one enemy of the people of Southeast Asia. These days, under
the leadership of Maoist Party, the oppressed people of India are challenging

the so called regional super power. This challenge has given to the people
of the whole world a great optimistic and enthusiastic inspiration.

The Great Peoples War of India is not only the concerning issue of
Indian people. In fact, it has a worldwide importance and value. It is part of
the world proletarian movement. The international campaign in support of
the  People’s War  in  India  serves  to  unite  the  Marxist-Leninist-Maoist
communists and the revolutionary forces internationally. In this regard we
condemn the state terror and war loaded by Indian reactionary regime to
the people of India. And we stand up in support of the Great People’s War
of India.

This is the week of the worldwide campaign in support of the Indian
People’s War. The people of Italy are in the forefront in this campaign and
we would like to express our strong solidarity with them. We request all,
especially the intellectuals and cultural activists, to express their solidarity
to support the campaign for the Great People’s War of India.

Red Salute To Comrade Kishanji!

26-11-2011

It is a matter of deep sorrow that the reactionary Indian government
has murdered Comrade Kishanji alias Malloujula Koteswara Rao, Politbuto
Member of CPI (Maoist), in a fake encounter in Burishol forest area, west
Midnaport District, Jangalmahal, West Bengal on 24 November 2011. He
was a leading figure and spokesperson for CPI (Maoist). According CPI
(Maoist) statement issued to the media, Kishanji was arrested and tortured
and then brutally killed.

Comrade Kishan is not unknown to us. We have already published his
interviews in Nepalese magazines. In this moment, our Revolutionary
Cultural-Intellectual Front strongly condemns the cold-blooded murder of
Comrade Kishanji – a true revolutionary hero of the oppressed people of
India. And we urge to all intellectuals and cultural activists of this region to
denounce this cowardly killing of Comrade Kishanji by the Indian reactionary
forces.

In a famous article ‘ Serve the People’, Comrade Mao has mentioned:
“Though death befalls all men alike, it may be weightier than Mount
Tai or lighter than a feather.” To die for the people is weightier than Mount
Tai, but to work for the fascists and die for the exploiters and oppressors is
lighter than a feather.”

Yes, it is true Comrade Kishanji died for the people, and his death is
indeed weightier than Mount Everest. From the bottom of our hearts we
express our Red Salute to the people’s hero Comrade Kishanji.

The Indian reactionary government has murdered Comrade Kishanji,
but not his ideology. They can’t kill Marxism-Leninism and Maoism. The
movement will continue, the revolution will continue.

We  know  the  reactionary  government  of  Nepal,  an  Indian  Puppet
government led by Baburam Bhattarai and coward Prachand, a new avatar

traitor of Indian expansionism. But we the revolutionary intellectuals and
the political activists who fought ten years People’s War and who are still
fighting for the people’s liberation, are always with the brave communist
fighters of India, oppressed people of India. In fact, the hundreds of millions
of oppressed people of the world, who dream of liberation, are always with
the oppressed people of India. The red flag of revolution will not be bent
down. The long march of revolution will not be stopped. Let us march
ahead.

Eternal Honor to Comrade Koteswara Rao

Solidarity to the Struggle of CP of India (Maoist)

With sorrow and anger we learned officially from the Communist Party
of India (Maoist) about the brutal murder of the leading cadre of the Indian
revolutionary communist movement Mallojula Koteswara Rao, member of
the Politburo of CPI (Maoist) on November 24, 2011. Comrade Rao, known
by the millions of revolutionary Indian peasants and poor as Kisenji, was
murdered in cold blood by the special forces of the Indian criminal state,
after chasing him in a forest area of West Bengal. Despite the claims of the
police that he was killed in an armed encounter, all evidence show that he
was murdered after being caught and tortured.

The hate of the Indian state was so great that it put restrictions in his
funeral so that it might not become mass mobilization. Comrade Rao was a
leading personality and had guided great struggles of the peasants, the dalits
and the indigenous people in eastern India, he was the inspirator of resistance
and great popular movements of Singhur, Nandigram and Lalghar that have
shook irreparably the government of W. Bengal and had a great influence
on the movements in all of India. A militant fighter since fifteen, Rao, took
part in the great uprising of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh in 1969. He was a
child of a poor family in the Indian countryside and he devoted his whole
life till his death to the cause of the revolution. He was the protagonist in
the unification of the two great organizations of the naxalite movement and
the formation of the CP India (Maoist) in 2004. He was the organizer of the
political and military successes of the guerrilla movement in the whole of
Eastern India, the famous “red corridor”.

For all these reasons comrade Rao was one of the main targets of the

192   Internatioal Messages and Statements

criminal head hunters of the Indian regime during the so called operation
“Green Hunt”. The target of this genocidal operation is the uprooting of the
revolutionary movement with mass killings, village burnings, population
transfer and other brutalities. The murder of comrade Rao is one in many
targeted killings of leading cadres in recent years aiming at the beheading of
the  revolutionary  movement.  There  human  losses  that  are  heavy  as  a
mountain and the loss of comrade Rao is such one to the millions of poor
workers and peasants of India. That is why the reactionary regime of India
and its propaganda media are rejoicing all these days. Unfortunately for
them there are thousands of fighters like comrade Rao in India who are
ready to take his place in the struggle for a society of justice and freedom.
The Communist Party of Greece (marxist-leninist) sends its warm
condolences and solidarity to the comrades of the CP India (Maoist), to all
popular resistance movements and the family of comrade Rao. It condemns
the criminal Indian regime that supports the interests of an oligarchic minority
against the hundreds of millions of poor popular masses. We stress our
solidarity to the revolutionary movement of the Indian people, a revolutionary
movement that is in the forefront of the revolutionary struggles of the people

dominantes de la India por el asesinato a base de torturas de un gran dirigente
cmunista del PCI (Maoista), el camarade KISHENJI, integrante del Buro
Politico y Militar del Partido.

Creen vanamente que podran detener la vigorosa luch armada del pueblo

retrasar un poco la caida del sistema de opresion, pero no evitaria, eso es

La sangre derramada del camarade Kishenji, aunque causa profundo

para abonar el largo camino a la liberacion de los pueblos de la India;
ninguna sangre revolucionaria se derrama en vano, pues cuando los objetivos

Los grandes maestros del marxismo nos ensenaron que el proletariado,
los pueblos y sus dirigentes tienen que entregar inevitablemente una cuota
de sangre, sufrimientos y carcel para poder derrumbar los muros de la
reaccion y avanzar hacia un nuevo mundo, nueva sociedad y nueva vida.
El camarada KISHENJI ha pagado esa cuota con su propia vida, no solo
ahora, sino desde que en los anos 70 ingreso a las filas de la rebelion
popular, dando su vida a los propositos de liberacion del pueblo, vivendo en
la clandestinidad, en medio de los combates y la construccion del Nuevo

The  Communist  Party  of  the  Philippines  (CPP)  condemns  in  the
strongest terms possible the brutal torture and cowardly murder of Comrade
Malloujula Koteswara Rao, popularly known in India as Comrade Kishenji,
spokesperson and Politburo Member of the Communist Party of India

The reactionary Indian government claims that Comrade Kishenji was
killed in an encounter in the Burishol Forest Area in West Midnapore District,
Jangal Mahal, West Bengal. According to information provided by the
CPIMaoist, Comrade Kishenji was, in fact, negotiating with officials of the
West Bengal government when he was treacherously seized and arrested
by the fascists.

Comrade Kishenji is a beloved comrade and servant of the Indian
people. His brutal murder has unleashed a wave of sorrow and indignation
among the oppressed and exploited people of India as well as among the
proletariat and peoples of the world.

The imperialists and reactionaries and their fascist lapdogs in India have
succeeded in satiating their bloodlust in torturing and murdering Comrade
Kishenji. But they will pay for this brutal crime. The Indian people will
continue to advance along the revolutionary path of armed resistance and
mass struggle.

In the end, the reactionaries will be overthrown and put to justice as the

The killing of Comrade Mallojula Koteshwaor Rao ‘Kisanji’, politburo
member and top leader of CPI(Maoist), on 24 November, by Indian armed
forces in Burisol forest area of west Midnapur district in West Bengal, has
shocked and saddened us. According to the latest information, he was
captured on November 23 and was murdered cowardly after his refusal to
surrender. That’s why, we condemn this fake encounter and demand to the
Central and West Bengal State government to form an independent
commission to investigate the killing of comrade Kisanji and to take the
action against those criminals, who were involved in the killing. Comrade
Rao was one of the main top leaders of CPI(Maoist). He began to provide
his political contributions in the Communist Movement, as a student member
of ‘Radical Student Union’, from his birthplace Andhra.

Thereafter, he led the party in Andhra, Bihar, Maharashtra, and West
Bengal. He did great effort and provided a great contribution to develop the
guerrilla warfare in West Bengal. He was a true leader of international

The Surge of Mass Rising can’t be Stopped by Killing Us

Statement on the Brutal Killing of Indian Maoist

Communist Leader Comrade Kishenji

The Communists guide the oppressed class to the way of freedom, lead
them in the struggle of changing their fate. Hence, for the reactionaries, the
most favourite option for keeping the oppressed under control is to demolish
the communists. It is their design to diminish the onward movement of
revolution,  which  is  essential  for  the  oppressed  class.  In  the  Indian
subcontinent, such a barbaric attitude was first imported by Indira Gandhi
and the Congress govt. Later on, it was exported to the neighbouring countries
including East Bengal. Sonia Gandhi, daughter-in-law of Indira Gandhi,
present leader of the Indian Congress party, is still practising the same
reactionary, savage, severe policy of which Comrade Kishenji has been the
last victim.

Comrade Kishenji alias Koteshwara Rao was the Polit Bureau member
of the Communist Party of India (Maoist). With a goal to establishing neo-
democracy, socialism and communism overthrowing the rule of imperialism-
feudalism and bureaucratic-capitalism, Comrade Kishenji, both in practice
and theory, had been playing a decisive role in the Maoist people’s war led
by the CPI(M).

Under the leadership of comrade Kishenji, people’s war of the Maoists
developed in Telengana, Dandakaranya, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal
provinces, particularly in the Junglemahal region, shook the base of Indian
exploit some ruling class. As a result, the central govt. of India led by wared
Sonia-Manmohan and their partner West Bengal state govt. led by Mamata
Banerjee, became up and to uproot the Maoists, especially to assassinate
one of the top leaders Comrade Kishenji. Consequently, Comrade Kishenji
was  arrested,  tortured  in  chains  and  brutally  killed  in  the  region  of

September 2004 - August 2014  199

Junglemahal on 24 November under the guise of so called encounter.

Comrade Kishenji dreamt of the freedom of the oppressed class. His
dream is our own dream. His dream is the dream of the Maoist communists
all over the world. Comrade Kishenji had been in the forefront of the
worldwide  struggle  for  establishing  neo-democracy,  socialism  and
communism overthrowing the rule of imperialism-feudalism and bureaucratic-
capitalism. So, the killing of Kishenji is a great loss for the Maoist communists
all over the world. And the oppressed class have lost a forerunner of their
war.

Like Comrade Kishenji, we too, in our country, are struggling, for
establishing neo-democracy, socialism and communism overthrowing the
rule of imperialism-feudalism and bureaucratic-capitalism. In this case, Indian
reactionary ruling class is one of the biggest enemies to our revolution . So,
we consider that, the struggle of the Indian communists against these same
enemies, goes in favour of the revolution of our country. For this, the brutal
killing of Comrade Kishenji, we are hurt at losing our nearest one. It gives
us pain of shedding blood and losing flesh, bone marrow of our own body
as we felt at the death of Comrade Siraj Sikder, Comrade Taher Azmi,
Comrade Ramkrishna Paul. We are deeply saddened at the death of Comrade
Kishenji and expressing severe condemnation of this barbarous killing.

The aim of the reactionaries is to suppress the revolution by committing
killing of Comrade Charu Majumder, Comrade Siraj Sikder along with
innumerable Maoists. Let their evil design never come true. For this, we
have  to  advance  the  revolutionary  struggle  for  the  implementation  of
Kishenji’s dream, all of our own dream, being united with all the Maoist
communists of the world. Thus we have to prove again that, “The surge of
mass rising can’t be stopped by killing us”.

We express our deepest condolence to the CPI (M) and to the bereaved
family of Comrade Kishenji and hope that they will recover the loss soon.
It is a universal fact that “day and night appear by phases.” and “darkness
and light substitute each other”. In the same way, “triumph shall mount

World Proletarian Revolution.

We the Communist believed that the demise of Comrade Kishenji will

famous article “serve the people”, Comrade Mao has mentioned: “Though
death befalls all men alike, it may be weightier than Mount Tai or lighter

work for the fascists and die for the exploiter is lighter than a feather”. Yes,
it is true Comrade Kishenji died for the people, in his death is indeed weightier
than Mount Everest. From the bottom of our hearts we expressed our red
salute to the hero of Indian Proletariat Comrade Kishenji.

The Indian reactionary has murdered Comrade Kishenji but not his
ideology. They can’t kill Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. The movement will
continue, the revolution will continue. The Indian People’s War is facing a
huge  counter-insurgency  pushed  by  the  Indian  counterrevolution  and
supported by the Imperialist countries. Manipur and its neighboring sister
states has been brutalized by imposing the Armed Forces Special Powers
Act, 1958 which a non commission officer empower to kill anyone in
suspicion and no state body have the right to institute a commission without
permission of Indian Home Minister. The act only imposed in North Eastern

with any mainland Indian state. The Indian Army racially oppresses the

widespread  and  tempestuous  peoples’  war  in  the  world––which  the
reactionary Indian state considers the biggest threat for its exploitative and
oppressive rule. The reactionary Indian state is the representative of the
interests  of  bourgeois  and  feudal  comprador  classes  and  pursues  an
expansionist politics in the region; it possesses a capitulationist position
visà-vis the imperialists, particularly the American imperialists. Recently

September 2004 - August 2014  207

Manmohan  Singh  and  Hamid  Karzai  signed  an  all-inclusive  strategic
agreement, which contains a security aspect, between the reactionary Indian
state  and  the  Kabul  puppet  regime. After  sealing  this  agreement,  the
reactionary Indian state has become the main regional functionary of the
occupying war of the American imperialists and their allies in the region; it
is now the primary regional supporter of the puppet regime, and thus is in a
position of direct enmity with the peoples of our country.

The Communist (Maoist) Party of Afghanistan once again expresses its
deep sympathy and condolences on the occasion of comrade Kishenji’s
death to the comrades of the Communist Party of India (Maoist). We strongly
believe that the hundreds of millions of striving revolutionary masses in
India have the capacity to endure the aforementioned loss and will continue
to expand their revolutionary war.

Dear Comrade,

We have the honor to invite you in the forthcoming historic 7th  National
Congress of the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist going to be held on

the reason that it is going to be held after a long period of over two decades,
but also due to the fact that it is going to be held at a political situation
where we are at the cross road of revolutionary transformation of Nepalese
society or returning back to the reactionary state. We are facing a severe
blow to our national sovereignty and national independence. The National
Congress has responsibility of finding out the solution of the confronting
problems.

Our Party attaches high importance to the friendly relation between our
two parties and the people of our two countries. We like to invite you
cordially to attend or send greetings to the National Congress and express
solidarity in our cause and make the historic event a grand success.

To
Central Committee
Communist Party of India (Maoist)

Dear Comrades,

On behalf of the Central Committee and the whole rank and file of our
Party, we wish you our warmest revolutionary greetings. It’s been a long
time since we wished to get in touch with you and we are really happy that
we finally managed to do so.

Our Party was created six years ago in January 2007 after a protracted
period of ideological and political struggle in Canada to grasp Marxism-
Leninism-Maoism  and develop a comprehensive  programme that now
serves as a guideline for the Communists and revolutionary activists in our
country.

Despite the fact our forces are still pretty small, we always considered
necessary to be involved in the various  efforts for  regrouping and exchanging
with other  revolutionary  parties and organizations- especially those who
uphold Maoism. This is why we engaged in a unity-struggle-unity process
with the RIM, a few months before it collapsed. It is for the same reason
that we supported the launch of Maoist Road  as a tool for promoting
exchanges between former RIM members and other non-RIM parties.

Supporting the parties and organizations that are already engaged in
revolutionary struggle in their respective countries is an important proletarian
internationalist task for any revolutionary organization- be it a small pre-
party formation, a still “novice” party or a well-developed one. In fact, we
think that such activity is part of the necessary work for building genuine
Maoist parties able to wage revolutionary struggle in their own country.

In a context where the crisis of the capitalist-imperialist system is widening
and the people’s resistance growing, we think the Maoist forces must make

210   Internatioal Messages and Statements

a qualitative step forward and face the challenge of waging the revolutionary
struggle. They should break with dispers ion and the “wait and see” attitude
of too many.

For our part, we are ready and genuinely interested in taking part in any
effort to regroup and provide a space of discussion for the various MLM
parties and organizations -be it at the level of anti-imperialist struggle or that
of party-to-party relationships. There is no usefulness to rush for the creation
of a new international center or a new organization that will consider itself
as such (as was the RIM): the setting up of an international center will
require a very much greater unity than what currently exists within our
movement,  and  such  unity  can  only  come  from  serious  and  extensive
discussions on both the ideological, political and organizational problems
our movement is facing. However, there is an urgent need for holding such
discussions and exchanges, and we wi!! be happy to modestly contribute to
that process.

Message of Solidarity to the People’s War in India

led by the Communist Party of India (Maoist)

On the occasion of the International Day of Support for the People’s
War in India, the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP)
conveys its warmest revolutionary greetings of solidarity and comradeship
to the Communist Party of India (Maoist), the People’s Guerrilla Liberation
Army (PGLA), and the revolutionary masses in India. The NDFP comprises
the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), the New People’s Army
(NPA) and 15 other revolutionary allied organizations. We reiterate our
firm  support  for  the  People’s War  in  India  launched  and  led  by  the
Communist  Party  of  India  (Maoist). We  are  confident  that,  with  the
enthusiastic participation and support of the oppressed masses in India, the
CPI (Maoist) will win victory against the fascist "War on People" being
waged by the Indian reactionaries supported by US imperialism and other
imperialist powers..

The regime’s "Operation Green Hunt" and other forms of its "War on
People" are bound to be defeated by the Indian revolutionary forces led by
the  CPI  (Maoist). As  Comrade  Ganapathy,  Secretary  General  of  CPI
(Maoist) has aptly declared, "People who are the makers of history will rise
up like a tornado under our party’s leadership to wipe out the reactionary
blood-sucking vampires ruling our country."

In the Philippines, the Filipino people are also waging a People’s War
against US imperialism and the local reactionaries of big landlords and
compradors.  We  are  fighting  against  the  US-designed  fascist
counterinsurgency  program,  deceptively  named  "Oplan  Bayanihan"
(Operation  Plan  Cooperation),  which  perpetrates  gross  human  rights
violations against the peasants, workers, indigenous people, urban poor,
women, youth and other sectors of the people. The puppet Aquino regime

September 2004 - August 2014  213

carries  out  the  neoliberal  policies  of  liberalization,  deregulation,  and
privatization..The oppressed masses in the Philippines are rising to wage
militant struggles led by the CPP.. They participate and enthusiastically
support the people’s war that is now being carried out  in 70 out of 81
provinces of the country.

We take this occasion to render our revolutionary salute to Comrade
Azad and all the martyrs of the Indian people’s Revolution. They live in the
People’s War and anti-imperialist and revolutionary struggles in India and
in the world. We likewise honor our beloved guerrilla commander and
spokesperson of the CPP, Gregorio "Ka Roger" Rosal and other revolutionary
martyrs of the Filipino people. .

We salute our comrades-in-arms waging People’s War in India! We
wish them and the Indian people they lead ever greater victories in their
New Democratic Revolution and in establishing the People’s Democratic
Federal Republic and thereafter the socialist system, Their brilliant victories
inspire us and other revolutionary forces in the world.

We take this opportunity to express our very deep appreciation for the
week of solidarity last April which the CPI (Maoist) carried out for the CPP
and the People’s War in the Philippines.

Communist Party of the Philippines Declares Philippine

Solidarity Month for the People’s War in India

The  Communist  Party  of  the  Philippines  (CPP),  together  with  all
revolutionary forces in the Philippines, declare July 2013 as Philippine
Solidarity  Month  for  the  People’s War  in  India. The  CPP  issues  this
declaration in unity with the call of democratic and anti-imperialist forces
for an international day of support for the people’s war in India on 1 July.
Let us pay our highest tribute to the heroes and martyrs of the Indian
people’s revolution, celebrate its victories, and look forward to its further
advances in the future.

The CPP calls on all its entire membership, all Red fighters of the New
People’s Army (NPA) and all revolutionary forces and people under its
leadership to carry out educational and cultural activities all throughout the
month  of  July  to  further  deepen  the  Filipino  revolutionary  forces’
understanding of and solidarity with the people’s democratic revolution in
India.

Party  branches,  units  of  the  NPA,  chapters  of  revolutionary  mass
organizations and governmental departments will devote one or several
days of activities during the month of July to carry out such activities as
educational discussions, film showings, cultural presentations and mass
propaganda undertakings to express solidarity and generat support for the
people’s war in India.

In launching the Philippine Solidarity Month for the People’s War in
India, the CPP reciprocates the solidarity week launched by the Communist
Party of India (Maoist) or CPI-M last 22-28 April coinciding with the 40th
anniversary of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP)
last 24 April.

Despite the geographical distance and national peculiarities, the people’s

September 2004 - August 2014  215

war in India and the Philippines share many similarities. Foremost, both
people’s war are under the leadership of communist parties that adhere to
Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and which are deeply rooted among the toiling
masses of the people.

Both advance the democratic interests of the peasants and indigenous
peoples for land against the land monopolists and the encroachment of
foreign mining companies and foreign monopoly capitalist plunderers.

Both advance the democratic struggles of the workers, youth, students,
women and other democratic sectors against the exploiters and oppressors.
The CPI-M is at the helm of the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army in
the  same  manner  that  the  CPP  leads  the  New  People’s Army  in  the
Philippines. Both wage extensive and intensive guerrilla warfare while building
the people’s organs of democratic political power and waging campaigns to
advance the land reform movement. Enjoying widespread support, the PLGA
and the NPA continue to expand and accumulate great victories in the field
of revolutionary armed struggle.

The people’s war in India and the Philippines are both confronted with
brutal campaigns of suppression being carried out by the reactionary forces
under the direction of the US imperialist government. The Operation Green
Hunt of the Indian reactionaries and the Oplan Bayanihan of the Philippine
reactionaries both employ the most abominable forms of armed suppression
resulting in gross and widespread violations of human rights. Invariably,
these acts of suppression are directed against the revolutionary masses in a
vain attempt to terrorize the people.

The US imperialists and the reactionaries vilify the revolutionary forces
in India and the Philippines as “terrorists.” They have, however, failed to
stymie the growth of the people’s revolutionary movements in India and
the Philippines which both have advanced steadily with the deep and broad
support of the people. The people’s war in India and the Philippines have
repeatedly and decisively frustrated the reactionaries’ attempts at armed
suppression as they firmly adhere to the people’s aspirations for democracy.
The Indian and Philippine revolutionary forces both seek and work to
help build a broad international anti-imperialist and democratic movement

216   Internatioal Messages and Statements

to advance the interests of the toiling masses amidst the worsening crisis of
the international capitalist system and the bankruptcy of the neoliberal
policies. The people’s war in India and the Philippines see great potential
for revolutionary advancements in the face of the intensification of the
exploitation and oppression of peoples in both capitalist and semi-colonial
and semi-feudal countries.

The CPP acclaim the CPI-M and all revolutionary forces in India for
persevering along the road of people’s war. The people’s of the world
anticipate the growth and great advance of the people’s war in India as the
people of India continue to rise up and revolt against the oppression and
exploitation of the ruling classes and the imperialists. The peoples of the
world see the epic dimensions and potentials of the people’s war in India to
change the face of the earth in a big way, in much the same way that the
victory of the revolution in China and Russia altered the international balance
of the class struggle.

The Filipino people look forward to the complete victory of the Indian
revolution even as they seek to achieve victory in their own homeland. The
Filipino and Indian people are serving the interests of the proletariat and
peoples around the world by waging people’s wars in their homelands and
dealing armed blows against the imperialist and their reactionary lackeys.
Their advances and victories will indubitably inspire all other peoples of the
world to stand up against the imperialists and wage revolution to achieve
national and social liberation.

SUPPORT THE PEOPLE’S WAR IN INDIA

Support People’s War in India -

Towards New Campaigns, Towards New Conference!

21-09-2013

The real introduction to our meeting is the important document by the
CPI(Maoist)  signed  by  com.  Ganapathy,  greeting  the  International
Conference in Hamburg.

Even if it came in late, it is an important document, that excites us and
confirms the line followed by the International Committee has and fulfilled
by International Conference in Hamburg was.

The  paper  contains  important  indications  that  the  International
Committee, in its full autonomy, will follow carrying out its tasks and aims.
At the same time we have to pay attention to the call of the Party for “the
week of the Martyrs”.

Of course, our assessment and immediate mobilization is required for
the  information  we  received  about  repression,  killings  and  arrests  of
comrades.

The document points out that the democratic campaigns against OGH
and the support to the people’s are complementary, and then the struggle
against OGH has to be part of the activity in support to the PW.

The international conference in Hamburg gave a blow imperialism and,
at the same time, understood the need for unity between the international
support to the PW in India and the revolutionary tasks in each country.

International  conference  in  Hamburg  has  developed  also  the  anti-
imperialist mobilization and the need for a world anti-imperialist front - as
pointed out by Indian comrades. The international conference in Hamburg
was able to achieve a success thanks to the unity developed in the field
between the Maoist forces and the consistent anti-imperialist organizations,
both representing the international unity of the struggle of proletarians and
peoples.

September 2004 - August 2014  219

The purpose of the International Day of July 1 was to mobilize in
actions the forces that had taken part in the International Conference and
join other external forces. The date of July 1 , chosen for the anniversary
of the martyrdom of Comrade Azad, was preceded by the mighty blow
dealt to the Indian state by the attack on 25 May. A blow that had international
repercussions and has been rightly welcomed with enthusiasm by the people
of the world.

We know that after 25 May the Indian regime and imperialism unleashed
a intensified repressive campaign, but the International Day organized by
the International Committee had the aim of propagating the strength of the
25 May attack.

The day was a success for the number and quality of the initiatives, but
this success is mainly measured by the participation of new forces, particularly
the CP of Philippjnes and ILPS. Also significant was the participation of
forces that before had attacked the Committee and that they now have
made the right choice to take part in the International Day.

Our Bullettin report clearly gives room to this participation, because the
aim of the Bulletin is not the self-propaganda, but to show the inclusive
strength of the International Day.

The aim of mobilizing in Europe, Latin America and Asia, to make the
support for the PW in India visible, not only with statements of solidarity
but also with militant actions in each country, according to the possible
level, has been fully achieved.....

....But this success goes also beyond the number of actions realized. As
they comrades of CPI(Maoist) said, you know friends in the critical moments.
While in all the world, inspired by imperialism, they were screaming against
the attack of 25 May, and in India was being unleashed an unprecedented
onslaught, to see throughout the World such a broad action in support to
the PW in India was a blow to imperialism and Indian regime.

What  pointed  out  in  the  same  document  about  the  international
conference, we can say for the International Day of July 1: “ the forces of
the International Conference have dealt a hard blow to imperialism and the

220   Internatioal Messages and Statements

Indian ruling classes, filling with hope the great ocean of the oppressed
masses.”

In Hamburg we decided that our action would be continued according
to the objective of the international conference: to intensify the struggle as
an act of war, as a way to participate in the war against imperialism.

We can not reduce the current situation in India to the issue of repression.
In India a people's war is fought as part of the world proletarian revolution,
it is today the strongest one, though fortunately not the unique: the people's
war advances in the Philippines, as well as is prepared to move forward in
other countries.

The  International  Day  once  again  showed  the  existence  of  the
International Committee with facts, with the aim of organizing and developing
a large movement of solidarity.

The  document  of  CPI(Maoist)  emphasizes  the  importance  of  the
solidarity for Vietnam in the 70s, and how this movement had contributed
to the development of other revolutionary movements. We say clearly that
the campaign of support is strengthening the revolutionary movement in
each country. All the forces that participated in the International Conference,
later strengthened themselves in the respective countries, none of them has
neglected their national tasks. The organizations attending here and others
that have sent messages to this meeting show how the work to advance the
revolution has grown internationally after the conference.

Also the need of an anti-imperialist front advanced with the conference
and the International Day of 1 July. We all want a front that unites all the
forces fighting imperialism in all its aspects and the campaign of support for
the PW in India is a strong link and a point of reference for this construction.
The political and ideological value of the campaign is greater of its own
practical strength. But it is good not to be triumphalist. It must be said that
there are some forces of the International Conference and the International
Committee that could have done more. On this we must move forward
determined to match the words to facts.

September 2004 - August 2014  221

So we need to treat the issue of how to continue, to assess both the
positive and negative aspects, both the clear achievements and steps forward
they are doing in other countries.

It is unnecessary to call always new international days. Our whole
action should serve to deal blows to the enemy, harder and significant in the
context of the support.

The Committee is inspired by a general line, that lives in the objectives
it realizes not for itself but for the PW in India and for the development of
revolution all over the world.

Now the international dimension of the campaign must be greater in
each country, we need to consolidate the successes. The International Day
has provided new indications: the Filipinos comrades have declared a month
of solidarity, linked to the development of the class struggle in the country.
The International Committee accepts this method: we should work so
that in each country prolonged campaigns are built, defining at national
level when and how to realize an event or a series of events by which the
campaigns of the International Committee continue.

In order to strengthen the organizational dimension of the Committee,
we need a website or blog managed by the Committee, improving the work
made  by  other  sites,...,  because  we  need  systematic  news  counter-
information about the PW, as well as about the activities of support by the
International Committee and all the forces supporting the PW. We need
such a tool and we have to plan the different contributions that can be given
to it.

The other important organizational problem is to analyze the situation
in each country, in order to see the actual stage of the support, advance in
the construction of local committees or table coordination of forces, not
related to single campaigns.

This process is not short, we aim to realize within 6 months a new
organizational situation that supports the new wave of campaigns on the
basis of the forces that exist and can be involved....

When we resume our support we should start, as ever, from the actual

222   Internatioal Messages and Statements

situation that develops in India. The repressive action of the Indian State
creates problems and difficulties for the PW. In particular it develops a
concentration of attacks against intellectuals, students, people who oppose
the OGH and vivify the Revolutionary Democratic Front. There are 4,000
political  prisoners  being  tortured  in  prisons.  The  orientation  of  the
CPI(Maoist) is to re-launch, also internationally, campaigns for the release
of its leaders.

On this we must take a stand quickly and immediately pass to the
action: against the persecution of GM Saibata, in defense of the Revolutionary
Democratic Front, against the arrests of students, in support of political
prisoners.

The International Committee does not just take a stand, but to position
should corresponds a type of appropriate action. The particularity of the
attack to Saibaba should be explained in all its aspects, it is a step ahead of
the Indian regime, its fascist nature. the details of this attack shows what
the Indian regime is.

The conference in Hamburg should encourage us in rallying all forces
in support of the PW. The idea of the Committee is a new International
Conference....to tie it to the new storm that passes in various countries

To hold the Conference in another ountry allows us to collect and join

new  forces and actions

As the Indian comrades said oh their message: “ you realized your
international conference in the belly of the beast of imperialism, in Europe
…” Today, however, it is limited to think that all actions of solidarity can
take place in Europe. We have to go to other countries, to make every
region in the world a protagonist of this support. We know that it is difficult
to realize there an international conference, that it puts forward problems
and a type of participation different from those in Hamburg, but we all
understand the importance and the impact that a conference of this type

can have....

Down to the persecution against Professor GN Saibaba,

from New Delhi University!

We strongly condemns the arbitrary action of the Indian forces of
repression, in another desperate attempt to silence the voices of dissidence.
On Sept. 12, 2013, the house of Professor GN Saibaba, was raided by 50
agents whit the pretext to search “stolen materials”.

In the arbitrary operation, the agents prevented Professor Saibaba and
his family from go out home, receiving visitors, making and receiving phone
calls and contact an attorney. They didn’t found any stolen material and
went out from Saibaba’s house carrying personal belongings of the family,
including mobile phones, pen-drives and copies of publications of the
Revolutionary Democratic Front of India (RDF), the organization on which
Dr. Saibaba is secretary.

The Indian state with its common practices and increasingly recurrent
persecution, killings, arbitrary arrests and baseless accusations against the
defenders of the people’s struggle, try to stop the struggle of a people who
will not surrender in the face of intimidation and harassment.

Because of his choice to work in behalf of people, his effort to denounce
the  Operation  Green  Hunt,  his  work  as  an  academic  professor,  his
democratic and committed role on the defense of Indian people in the
struggle against oppression, violence and misery, we pay our solidarity and
respect to Professor GN Saibaba. We also condemn the fascist Indian state
for their crimes against the people and their leaders and declare that the
Brazilian people stand in support of the Indian people in their just struggle
for national and social liberation.

Unconditioned Release for All Political Prisoners in India!

25th January 2014 Great International Day

of Solidarity and Struggle !

In India more than 10.000 supposed Maoists are languishing in jails, to
them are to be added other thousands of prisoners involved in the national
liberation  movements  (Kashmir,  Manipur,  etc.)  or  other  democratic
movements.

Beside with the leaders, cadres and members of the PLGA, more than
the 90% of that number are Adivasi villagers who resisted the forced
evacuation; peasants who struggled against the MOUs signed by governments
and TNCs to exploit the people and continue the imperialist looting of
natural resources; activists of the national minorities organized against the
rising threat of Hindu communal fascism; students, intellectuals, artists
belonging the RDF and other democratic organizations, guilty of standing
on the side of the people facing the war on them waged by the Indian state;
people's women,feminists united to rebel against the huge escalation of
rapes, committed in part by the armed and police forces and paramilaty
fascist squads sponsored by the State, as weapon of the war on people.

In jails the prisoners face every kind of harassment, torture, denial of
bails, inhumane living conditions, arbitrary transfers, brutal assaults and
punishments of solitary confinement, and often the detained women are
raped.

In spite of the fierce condition of detention, prisoners are resisting and
struggling with revolutionary spirit and turning the dark jails in which are

September 2004 - August 2014  225

confined into a battlefront against the raising fascism in India and the Indian
regime.

The struggle for their unconditioned release is an urgent task for
all the solidarity forces and friends of Indian people, and it is integrant
part of the support for the victory of their liberation war.

But all India is more and more turned by the ruling classes into a

“prison house of people's movements”.

Since mid-2009, the Indian ruling classes, under the guidance and with
the assistance of imperialists, launched the multi-pronged and country-wide
offensive called Operation Green Hunt – a war on people to wipe out the
Maoist movement and suppress the genuine struggles of the people.

While repression on oppressed masses is the hallmark of any exploiting
state and always has been a feature of the Indian State, the Operation
Green has surpassed all the previous offensives both in its scale and brutality.
Thousands of revolutionary and democratic mass organizations leaders
and members have been assassinated, tortured and put in jails. Blamed
under false cases, many of them are facing harsh punishments.

Massacres, gang rapes, looting and destruction of villages by armed

forces have become the order of the day.

The Operation Green Hunt – War on People – is supposed aimed to
wipe out the Maoist movement but it is in fact it targets and is aimed to
suppress any genuine democratic demand of the people, by framing them
in cases linked with the CPI (Maoist) according the draconian laws adopted
by  the  central  and  state  governments,  that  brand  people's  leaders  and
strugglers as 'anti-national or terrorists'.

Stop the Operation Green Hunt, stop the War on People !
But the liberation war of the masses in India cannot be stopped by
the savage repression, rather it extends the political and moral solidarity
to the liberation war.

Many international initiatives and efforts built solidarity with people in
India  and  supported  their  struggle  for  liberation,  including  the  great
International Conference of Hamburg and the International Days of Actions

226   Internatioal Messages and Statements

organized by the International Committee of Support. These initiatives had
impact throughout the world and in India itself, dealt blows to imperialism
and the Indian regime, that today reacts urging the governments, first those
of EU, to stop the initiatives of solidarity.

It is for this reason that today more than ever it is necessary to further

consolidate and extend the solidarity.

Therefore we call to a large International Day of Solidarity and
struggle for the unconditioned release of the political prisoners in
India on 25th of January 2014, to be held everywhere is possible in the
world, in all the possible ways decided by the committees and solidarity
forces at national level, with street actions, that call the masses to participate,
and  counter-information  actions  and  protests  towards  embassies,
consulates, offices of the international press and humanitarian organizations
etc., to be held during the week before the International Day.

country is of enormous significance for the Indian revolution. With this
merger and the formation of the united Communist Party of India (Maoist)
the major Maoist forces in the country are now united in a single party. The
task yet remains to bring those still out into this new Party, basing on the
documents accepted by the CCs of both the parties.

This was the result of the confluence of two major streams of the
Indian revolution, that of the CPI(ML) and that of the MCCI, into a mighty
river of the CPI(Maoist). Except for a very brief period during 1969-1972,
when the CPI(ML) was in existence, this is the first time that the country
has a single, unified proletarian party. The CPI/CPM revisionists, have
caused enormous damage to the great revolutionary traditions of the Indian
people. Though some genuine Maoist forces still remain out of this new
Party, the major two streams of the Indian Maoist are now one. The strong
desire of the revolutionary ranks and progressive forces of the entire country,
together with that of the aspirations of the more conscious sections of the
oppressed masses, including the South Asian and International Maoist forces
has, at last, been fulfilled. A genuine communist party is at last born on the
Indian soil, nurtured by the blood of over 6,000 martyrs. Above all, it is a
tribute to the aspirations and hopes of the heroic martyrs, who gave their
lives for the cause of the liberation of our country, firstly from despotic
British  rule,  and  then  from  imperialism,  feudalism,  and  Comprador
Bureaucratic Capitalism.

Along with this merger the People’s Guerrilla Army (PGA), formed on
2nd December 2000 under the leadership of CPI(ML)[People’s War], and

230   Internatioal Messages and Statements

the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) formed on 22nd April 2003
under MCCI merged to form the new PLGA. It will continue to observe its
raising day on 2nd December 2000 signifying the day when armed forces
of the people was formed for the first time in the country and on the first
anniversary of the martyrdom of the three Central Committee members of
the erstwhile PW leaders, Coms. Shyam, Mahesh and Murali. This will not
merely double the strength of the separate parties it will lead to a qualitative
leap in the growth of the people’s armed forces incorporating the positive
aspects of both, thereby increasing the speed of transforming the guerrilla
army into a full-fledged PLA (People’s Liberation Army). It is these people’s
armed forces that are the backbone of the Party. With the merger these
forces have spread to about seven to eight states of the country with a
sizable striking capacity in at least four states.
Basis of the Merger

The merger has been built on a solid political/ideological basis combined
with a common practice of focusing on the armed struggle to set up Base
Areas. Organisationally too, the two parties have been built with professional
revolutionaries as the core and heart of the party. With strict principles for
recruitment, as set by the third international, both parties and their committees
have been built in the Leninist style as Bolshevised underground parties.
This facilitates the organisational merger of the two parties. Together with
these, a serious self-critical review of boths past practice and a public self-
criticism for the physical clashes during the period of the “Black Chapter”
made the foundation of the unity all the more solid.

But the basis was the five documents thoroughly discussed and passed
by  the  joint  CCs  of  the  erstwhile  two  parties.  These  were  the:  MLM
DOCUMENT: ‘Hold high the bright Red Banner of Marxism-Leninism-
Maoism’, the Programme, the Strategy & Tactics, a political resolution on
the international and domestic situation, and a Party Constitution.

Then  a  serious  discussion  took  place  on  the  separate  written  self-
criticisms of the two erstwhile parties for the period of the “Black Chapter”.
In short the following self-criticisms have been publicly put forward by
both:

September 2004 - August 2014  231

MCCI’s Self-Criticism put forward 5 major flaws – saying, “While we
said in words the PU (and later the PW) were revolutionary, in practice
we treated them as revisionist and reactionary; considering PU and PW
as  adversaries  we  concentrated  mostly  on  retaliation;  giving  wrong
arguments sought to trap them in endless debates; we even did some
activities that hurt the

revolutionary image of the PW; and we sought not to accept our faults

think that this would lower our image.”

These being the major errors of the MCCI, they stated that : “It resulted
from a petti-bourgeois outlook. Due to this trend an arrogant thinking,
like ‘We are no less than any body’, developed. Also we were affected by a
sectarian approach, subjectivism and a one-side approach. We express
our sorry openly before the entire revolutionary ranks and people and
express our deep regrets to the families of the affected.”

CPI (ML)[PW]’s Self-Criticism presented seven points, saying: “During
the period of the Black Chapter we launched killing attacks on our class
brothers; in the early 1990s itself the killing of Satyanarayan Singh was a
result of our political weakness; giving the call ‘Throw out the MCC’ was
a serious error; our propaganda and articles had an incorrect approach
which reflected a wrong assessment of the MCC; we mainly blamed the
MCC; we used non-proletarian methods to solve contradictions amongst
the people; we became a tail to the sentiments of the rank-and-file.”

Both organisations expressed their self-criticism, gave their red
salutes to the martyred comrades and expressed sorrow to the families
of the affected. Both pledged: no matter how sharp the contradictions
between them, they will never take up arms against their class brothers;
they promised to the masses that such suicidal attacks would ever be
repeated; and finally they said they vow to rectify their errors and
always persevere to become better proletarian revolutionaries.

Once these were accomplished and all other details of name, etc were
agreed on, the two CCs merged and unanimously elected its general secretary.

Strengthen the Strategic Offensive

of the People’s War in Nepal!
Uphold the Formation of the

Communist Party of India (Maoist)!
Turn the Countries of South Asia into
a Strong Bastion of World Revolution!

South Asia has entered a momentous period of struggle. Two forces
are pitted against each other. On the one hand, the forces fighting for a new
world; the revolutionary masses, their heroic struggles, their organisations,
with the Maoist parties at the forefront guided by Marxism-Leninism-Maoism.
On  the  other,  the  forces  upholding  the  old  order;  reactionary  forces;
imperialism and its local lackeys, who suck the blood of the masses. Yes,
South Asia is a storm centre of the world proletarian revolution.

The  People’s War  in  Nepal  led  by  the  Communist  Party  of  Nepal
(Maoist) has advanced to the strategic offensive, striving for the day when
the flag of the first victorious revolution of this century will be hoisted. The
masses in their millions are being mobilised and led into battle, well backed
by the new political power in the revolutionary base areas covering nearly
eighty per cent of the country. In India, two major Maoist parties, the
MCCI and the CPI (ML) (PW) have merged to form the Communist Party
of India (Maoist), thus strengthening the grounds for further advancing the
People’s War already spread over a significant part of the country. This is
an important event not only for the Maoist revolutionaries and masses in
India or of this region but for the entire movement. In Bangladesh, the
Maoist parties are extending their People’s Wars to new areas. In various

September 2004 - August 2014  233

countries of South Asia, the masses are stepping up their struggles against
imperialist globalisation, against the hideous misery caused by the inhuman
oppression and exploitation of imperialism and the compradorbureaucratic
bourgeois, feudal ruling classes. Oppressed nationalities continue to fight,
armed and otherwise, for their right of self-determination.

The imperialists, particularly the US imperialists, have been increasing
their stranglehold and military involvement in the countries of the region.
Over the past years, military intervention through the sending of officers
and  arms  to  Nepal  has  been  stepped  up.  Imperialism,  particularly  US
imperialism, and their agent Indian expansionism are the common enemies
of the peoples of South Asia. Apart form its interference in Nepal, Indian
expansionism has pushed its army deep into Bhutan to crush the liberation
struggle in Asom, terrorise the Bhutanese masses rising to struggle and
encircle the Nepalese revolution. It is now conducting a campaign near and
within the Myanmar border to crush the Manipuri liberation struggle. It
bullies and threatens neighbouring countries. Now, the Indian government,
led by the Congress and propped up by the revisionists, is preparing to
wage an undeclared war against the Nepali people, to save the genocidal
Gyanendra regime from impending doom. It has started joint operations
with the mercenary army of the regime through joint patrolling. The Indian
state has already illegally imprisoned or deported top leaders and activists,
including comrades Kiran and Gaurav, of the CPN (Maoist) and is increasing
repression against revolutionary Nepali mass organisations in India. In India
itself, the UPA government has imposed a new black law, more vicious
than the repealed POTA.

Picking up the counter-revolutionary plans designed by the previous
NDA government led by the BJP, it is preparing to unleash terror and
genocide to crush the Maoists and the revolutionary masses led by them. In
all the countries of South Asia the reactionary governments are savagely
attacking struggling forces, not even sparing public rallies or peaceful
demonstrations. Brutal torture, ‘disappearing’ and false encounters go on.
Revolutionaries in India and Bangladesh have been sentenced to death.
Yes, imperialism, the Indian expansionist state and other reactionary
states of this region are desperately trying to stamp out the fires of revolution,

234   Internatioal Messages and Statements

rebellion and resistance. They are marshalling all their forces. We too must
build stronger bonds of unity and dare to attain greater heights. Resistance
and struggle against imperialism is sharpening all over the world. We, in
South Asia, can and must give a powerful push and direction to this growing
tide of revolt. We must strengthen and spread the People’s Wars and initiate
new ones. We must turn the countries of South Asia into a strong bastion of
world revolution.

The time is ours! Seize it!
Fight Indian expansionist intervention in the neighbouring countries,
particularly Nepal!
Fight for the release of political prisoners!

Condemn the Fascist Attack of Feudal Tyrant

Gyanendra upon the Revolutionary People of Nepal !

Condemn the Fascist Attack of Indian Ruling Classes
on the Revolutionary Leaders and Masses of India !

A semi-colonial and semi-feudal Nepal, which was hardly known 10
years before by its name and geographical location in the globe, has now
become a focal point of keen attention the world over. On the one hand,
the establishment of people’s power all across the vast countryside of Nepal
by way of the people’s war, waged under the leadership of CPN (Maoist)
for the last ten years, and one year of strategic offensive in particular, has
become a source of inspiration for the oppressed all over the world and, on
the  other,  it  has  become  a  deadly  ideological  and  political  threat  for
imperialism, particularly the US imperialism and its puppet regimes, including
India.

Gyanendra Shahi, a hated smuggler and the ringleader of the palace
massacre, by usurping absolute power through a coup on February 1, 2005,
is not only massacring the revolutionary masses across the country but also
repressing brutally the parliamentary political parties, journalists, civil
societies, students, human rights activists and intelligentsia who raise their
voice against the royal military fascism. US imperialism, the main enemy of
the oppressed people all over the world, and Indian expansionism are trying
to prop up their puppet Gyanendra and his royal mercenary gangsters by
providing arms, ammunition, logistics and money in different pretexts.

In India, the reactionary expansionist ruling classes have stepped up
their countrywide coordinated campaign of brutal suppression of the people’s
war  led  by  the  CPI(Maoist)  ever  since  the  merger  of  the  MCCI  and
CPI(ML)[PW] in September last. They are propagating continuously about
the Ógrave dangerÔ posed by the long Red Corridor of armed struggle

stretching from the Base Areas in Nepal up to the guerrilla zones of Andhra
Pradesh or the so-called Compact Revolutionary Zone. They have initiated
a phenomenal increase in the central repressive forces to tackle the Naxalites,
undertaken massive modernization and special training of the forces, and
are using helicopters where necessary, along with a package of so-called
reforms  to  wean  away  the  masses  from  the  fold  of  the  Maoists.  The
democratic voice of the people is suppressed and the fundamental rights
guaranteed by the Indian Constitution are trampled underfoot in the vast
areas of armed struggle and nationality movements. The ruling classes have
also stepped up the attacks against every form of democratic struggle and
anti-imperialist movements.

In this situation, we the undersigned two Maoist parties solemnly appeal
to the entire oppressed masses, the world over, and Nepal and India in
particular, to raise voice against every evil design of imperialism and
expansionism to repress the revolutionary cause of the oppressed people in
Nepal and India. And we pledge to fight unitedly till the entire conspiracies
hatched by the imperialists and reactionaries are crushed and the people’s
cause of Socialism and Communism are established in Nepal, India and all
over the world.

Condemn the Massacre of the Maoist

Revolutionaries by the Fascist Turkish State!
Support the Ongoing people’s War in Turkey !!

We are very much distressed by the news that the fascist Turkish regime,
the lackey of the US imperialism, massacred 17 Maoist revolutionaries,
including  the  general  secretary,  comrade  Cafer  Cang¡z,  of  the  Maoist
Communist  Party  [Turkey-North  Kurdistan]  (MKP),  in  Mercan  in  the
Dersim region of Turkey, on the 16/17 of June 2005. We condemn this
contemptible act of cold-blooded murder in which the people’s great leaders
and fighters sacrificed their lives for the cause of new democratic revolution,
socialism and communism, in Turkey, as part of the world proletarian
revolution.

of those martyrs to transform this distress and grief into revolutionary wrath
against the class enemies and their master, imperialism led by the US

Condolence Statement

30-11-2005

The Co-ordination Committee of Maoist Parties and organizations Of
South Asia (CCOMPOSA) expresses its heartfelt condolence at the sudden
and unfortunate demise of our dear Comrade Karan Singh on 30th October
2005. He was suffering from cerebral malaria-jaundice combination and
was  in  comma  for  3  days.  It  saddens  our  heart  to  have  lost  a  great
revolutionary who always strived to uphold the principles of M-L-M.

CCOMPOSA  pays  its  red  homage  to  Karan  Singh.  He  played  an
important role in the initiation, formation and development of CCOMPOSA,
which came into existence in 2001, being a leader of RCCI (Maoist).

His active participation in the effort to unite all revolutionary forces of
South Asia is exceptional and unforgettable. He firmly and genuinely believed
in the necessity of ideological and political unity of all revolutionary forces
and the unity of all workers of the world to fight against all the reactions,
feudalism and imperialism.

As a member of the RIM Committee, his Party upheld the ideals of
RIM and showed great commitment in the international podium. A veteran
leader of the Communist Party of India, he contributed to the development
of revolutionary M-L-M in India. It was under his leadership that the RCCI
(Maoist) unified with the MCC in 2002. He also played an important role,
ideologically and politically, in bringing about the historic merger of PW
and MCC.

The demise of our invaluable comrade KS is a great loss for the entire
MLM family, in South Asia and indeed the whole world. We share this grief
with his family and friends, his Party and the entire revolutionary camp.

Comrade KS will continue to encourage us and inspire us in striving to

his life. He will forever live in the hearts and minds of the oppressed that he
dedicated his life.

Let us all uphold his ideals!
Let us keep the lamp burning!
Long live the unity of revolutionary forces of South Asia!

General Secretary,
Central Committee

Dear Comrade Ganapathy,

Red salutes from the Central committees of the Communist Party of the

Philippines and the Communist Party of Turkey/Marxist-Leninist!

We wish to respond to your letters dated November 6, 2004 and September
5, 2005 as well as to the accompanying letter of comrade v dated November 6,
2005.

We appreciate highly the historic merger of the CPI (People’s War) and the
MCCI. We congratulate your Party wholeheartedly for this great achievement.
We consider this an outstanding victory in advancing the new democratic
revolution in India and in inspiring the proletariat and people of the world to
intensify the revolutionary struggle against imperialism and reaction. We therefore,
fully understand the reasons why your Party could not join us in preparing the
second international seminar on people’s war last year.

We regard your Party as indispensably one of the core of three parties in
the international seminar on people’s war since 1998. Thus, we have delayed
the holding to this seminar since last year. We are happy that your Party is now
resolutely and actively working for the realization of the seminar in your region.
We are in full agreement that the aforesaid three parties continue to act as
the core and to take the initiative in preparing the seminar. In a previous letter
earlier this year, we proposed to you the program of activities of the seminar.
We continue to propose this, subject to your Party’s approval and amendment.
Maoist parties waging or preparing to wage people’s war are to be
invited to attend the forthcoming seminar on their own account. They may

September 2004 - August 2014  241

belong to RIM but should attend as individual parties. it is not necessary for
the  RIM to attend  because the parties attending can be represented directly
by their own delegations. The attendance of the RIM will only complicate
the relations of the parties in the seminar and will not contribute to the
solution of the complex problems facing the relations of Maoists parties and
organizations.

In  this  connection,  the  seminar  should  take  precedence  over  any
conference in which the RIM is presumed to have a weight heavier that any
of the equal and independent parties attending.

In accordance with the foregoing paragraph, we welcome the communist
Party of Nepal (Maoist) to join the core of the seminar. The three core
parties of the International seminar on PW can invite it as an additional
core member and request it to perform the functions related to the realization
of the next seminar, on its own account, the CPN(Maoist) is an outstanding
Party that has proven its mettle in people’s war. It would be a brilliant
addition to the core. In accordance with this letter, we seek a meeting with
the Europe-based representative of CPN (Maoist), in conjunction with your
meetings with the same within your region.

We agree with you that the seminar be held in the last week of February
next year. The number of delegations does not have to be large. Thus, the
personnel, material, technical and security requirements shall be relatively
less difficult and less prone to exposure to the enemy. It suffices that the
delegation of an attending Party is anywhere from a minimum of one to a
maximum of three. But of course, the host Party will be responsible for
much of the requirement.

We desire to make closer and stronger our comradely relations, as

communist fighters, in the spirit of proletarian internationalism!

With warmest regards,

Stop State Terror Against Maoists In India !

Demand Immediate Release of

Comrades Sunil Roy, Gaurav, Kiran & Others

We, the Maoist Parties of South Asia strongly condemn the State terror
on the people of India, particularly their vanguard, the CPI(Maoist). Ever
since the merger of the two parties, the MCCI and CPI(ML)[PW] {both
members of the CCOMPOSA} and the formation of the united CPI(Maoist),
the Central and State governments of India have been unleashing maniacal
terror against it. We strongly condemn this and warn that the greater the
repression the greater will be the people.s wrath.

It is now many months that the Indian government has been illegally
detaining senior leader and politburo member com Sunil Roy. In spite of his
advanced age and poor health they are treating him like an ordinary criminal.
Com. Sunil Roy (publicly known as Com. Shome) is not only a respected
leader  of  the  Indian  revolutionary  movement  he  was  also  known
internationally, being one of the important members of the CCOMPOSA.
In addition they also continue to illegally incarcerate senior leaders and
politburo members of the CPN(Maoist), comrades Kiran and Gaurav and
many other Nepalese Maoists.

The CCOMPOSA demands the unconditional and immediate release
of these senior leaders and all other political prisoners of South Asia illegally
being detained in Indian prisons.

Besides, it has recently come to our notice from the media that the
Indian rulers have been unleashing a most brutal and barbaric campaign, in
the name of Salwa Judum, against the tribals of Bastar (Chhatisgarh) who

September 2004 - August 2014  243

are under the leadership of the Maoists. It is reported the paramilitary and
lumpen forces led by an MLA have been resorting to terror of unspeakable
nature killing, burning, and looting. It is reported over 100 tribals have been
killed and not even women and children have been spared. Their heads are
being severed and stuck on their own houses to create terror. Over 30
young women have been gang-raped and six of them killed. 40 villages
have been burnt down and villagers gathered and kept in Vietnamese-style
strategic hamlets. The terror is reported to be going on till today. It is
reminiscent of British rule in India.

The  CCOMPOSA  demands  the  immediate  end  to  this  terror,  the
restoration of human rights in the region, and strict action against all those
responsible.

It is known that the Indian rulers, backed by their imperialist masters,
have resorted to such terror not only in India but other countries of South
Asia in the past like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and also against the nationality
movements of Kashmir and the North-East. The methods adopted go against
all civilized norms and will breed hatred against the Indian rulers in the
entire region.

CCOMPOSA demands the immediate end to the terror in Chattisgarh
and a public enquiry by an international tribunal into the so-called Salwa
Judum going on since the past five months.

Kick Bush out of South Asia!

Stop Imperialist, Particularly US Intervention in South Asia!!

Smash Imperialism, Particularly US, and

All their Lackeys in South Asia!!!

George W. Bush, the No.1 International terrorist and the greatest enemy
of the world people, plans to visit South Asia in the month of March this
year. The visit of this world’s biggest rowdy to our country is only meant
to further tighten the grip of the US Super Power over the countries of
South Asia. The immediate aim of Bush’s visit is to coerce and to win
support for its blood-bath in Iraq and Afghanistan and for its war mongering
policies all over the world. The organisations of the CCOMPOSA calls
upon the people of South Asia to oppose the visit of this international
gangster and prevent his entry by all means at their disposal.

Using the pretext of 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre and the
Pentagon, this big bully, egged on by the oil lobby and the military-industrial
complex in the US, had unleashed the bloodiest wars of this century by
invading Afghanistan and Iraq and creating unending gory blood-baths. He
has threatened to attack Iran, Syria, North Korea and several other countries
in the world. He had openly supported the bloody terrorist attacks by the
Israeli Zionist rulers against Palestinian civilians, massacring even women,
children and the old-aged in so-called acts of retribution. He had fomented
disturbances in Venezuela, Bolivia and other countries of Latin America. In
the name of containing terrorism he had launched attacks on “targets” in
other countries such as the missile strike in Damadola in the Bajur tribal
region of Pakistan on January 13 this year that killed 13 civilians. He is
openly blackmailing countries such as India to vote against Iran in the
September 2004 - August 2014  245

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The Indian government is
being pressurised to abandon its plans of investing in Syrian oil project
jointly with China.

In the name of fighting Islamic terrorism and, duping the people by
aggressively propagating CIA-fabricated lies, the US imperialists led by Bush
has unleashed heinous attacks on the Muslim people all over the world.
This global terrorist has either outlawed, or declared as terrorist, several
Maoist Parties such as the CPN(M) in Nepal, CPP in the Philippines,
CPI(Maoist) in India, and provided massive aid to the reactionary regimes
in these countries to enact fascist repression on revolutionary and democratic
movements. Such is the real aim behind the so-called war on terrorism led
by Bush and other imperialist chieftains.

The US imperialists are to be seen directly intervening in all the countries
of South Asia, whether it be India or Pakistan, or Nepal, Bangla Desh or Sri
Lanka. They have spread their tentacles far and wide — not only in the
sphere of their economies but also politically, socially, culturally. The
comprador ruling classes of these countries are prostrating before this
international gangster and betraying the interests of their country and people.
These lackeys are the worst enemies of their own people. They sell the
country’s and people’s interests for a few crumbs from the imperialist table.
We the Maoist organisations of South Asia call on the people of the
region to mobilise on a huge scale against the Bush visit; smash their lackeys
in the region who are laying out the red carpet for this demonic criminal;
and unite firmly with each other against their common enemy.

4-Party Proposal to Celebrate the Historic Milestones

in Struggle against Modern Revisionism Since 1956

February 2006

We, the undersigned, hereby propose to all Marxist-Leninist-Maoist
parties and organizations to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the struggle
against modern revisionism and to undertake activities for the purpose of
renewing our commitment to pursue this struggle, which started in 1956 in
opposition to the revisionist content of the 20th Congress of the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in February 1956.

The struggle against modern revisionism reached a new and higher
level when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began in May 1966.
But alas, since the death of Comrade Mao in September 1976, we have
been confront-ed with the betrayal of socialism and the restoration of
capitalism in China. We are challenged to uphold Marxism-Leninism-
Maoism, combat modern revisionism and its evil consequences and achieve
greater victories in fulfilling the historic mission of proletariat to achieve
socialism.

In the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Soviet revisionist clique headed
by Khrushchov repudiated the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism and the
revolution-ary achievements of Comrade Stalin under the pretext of opposing
“personali-ty cult”. It unveiled the phenomenon of modern revisionism in
opposition to pro-letarian dictatorship and put the Soviet Union on the road
of capitalist restoration.

It propagated bourgeois populism with the notions of “party of the

the notions of “peaceful transition,” “peaceful competition” and “peaceful
coexistence”. It used modern revisionism to undermine and subvert the

September 2004 - August 2014  247

international communist movement. It pushed “peaceful coexis-tence” as
the general line to oppose proletarian internationalism and to attack the
international communist movement and the national liberation movements.
Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist
Party promptly issued in April 1956 the editorial of the People’s Daily, “On
the  Historical  Experience  of  the  Dictatorship  of  the  Proletariat”.  This
defended the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism against the line of
modern revisionism. It denounced the revisionists for sowing con-fusion in
the international communist mov-ement and generating disorder and upris-
ings against the socialist cause in Poland, Hungary and elsewhere in Eastern
Europe.

The delegation of the Chinese Communist Party pursued the anti-
revisionist line in the Moscow meetings of communist and workers’ parties
in 1957 and 1960. Thereafter, it proceeded to the criticism and repudiation
of the growing phenome-non of monopoly bureaucrat capitalism and social
imperialism during the long regime of Brezhnev. Monopoly bureaucrat capital-
ism masqueraded as socialism while the bureaucrats and businessmen
connived to steal from the state sector. In international relations, the Soviet
revisionists engaged in socialist phrase-mongering and in the practice of
imperialism.

Comrade  Mao  did  not  rest  content  with  the  critique  of  modern
revisionism as it arose and grew in the Soviet Union and in the other countries
of  the  Soviet  bloc.  He  examined  and  analyzed  the  growth  of  modern
revisionism in China, arising from both homegrown factors and external
influences. Thus, he launched the Great Proletarian Revolution in order to
carry out the theory of continuing revolution under proletarian dictatorship.
This is to combat revisionism, prevent the restoration of capitalism and
consolidate socialism.

For as long as Comrade Mao was alive, he was able to lead the Chinese
proletariat and people from victory to victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural
Revolution against tremendous odds and against powerful adversaries. But
soon after his death, the enemies of the Chinese proletariat and people
made a coup and reversed his proletarian revolutionary line in carrying out
socialist revolution and construction. Since then, China has increasingly

248   Internatioal Messages and Statements

taken the road of capitalist restoration.

The full restoration of capitalism in China vindicates the teaching of
Comrade Mao that socialism is lost when the revisionist line prevails within
the ruling communist or workers’ party and that eventually the bourgeoisie
within the party and state succeeds in unleashing a coup and overthrowing
the proletariat. Comrade Mao has bequeathed to us a legacy by which we
can combat and defeat modern revisionism and by which we can revive
and further develop the forces of socialism.

For the entire year of 2006, we must undertake general campaigns and
specific activities of theoretical and political education. We must confront
the problem of modern revisionism as the most venomous enemy of the
revolution-ary cause of socialism. We must reaffirm the written works and
practical efforts of Comrade Mao and all other proletarian revolutionaries
to uphold Marxism-Leninism and combat modern revision-ism. We must
defend the achievements of Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao in socialist
revolution and construction.

We must reaffirm Comrade Mao’s revolutionary theory and practice of
continuing revolution under proletarian dictatorship through the Great
Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must condemn the betrayal of socialism
and of Comrade Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line by the Chinese capitalist
roaders. We must combat the varied revisionist tendencies that deviate
from the scientific essence of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and its concrete
application to revolutionary practice. We can do so by countering not only
the traditional revisionist trends, classical and modern, but also various later
trends, like Hoxaism and Trotskyism, which carry a revisionist content
behind the ultra-Left appearance,

We must renew our determination and efforts to carry out the historic
mission of the proletariat, which is to carry out socialist revolution and
construction. All the evils that have beset the former revisionist-ruled
countries should drive us to uphold Marxism-Leninism-Maoism against
modern revisionism and to pur-sue the revolutionary cause of socialism.

Upon the temporary success of modern revisionism against Marxism-
Leninism and the dictatorship of the proletariat, monopoly capitalism headed
by US imperialism has been able to launch the worst attacks against the
September 2004 - August 2014  249

proletariat and the oppressed peoples, such as “free market” globalization,
racism, repression and wars of aggression. In response to the escalation of
oppression and exploitation, the proletariat and people are intensifying their
resistance through armed struggle and other forms of resistance.

It is the internationalist duty of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist parties to unite
and to arouse, organize and mobilize the proletariat and people in their
respective countries and in the world at large in the struggle for national
liberation, democracy and socialism against imperialism, revisionism and
reaction. By celebrating the 50 years of struggle against modern revisionism,
we renew our commitment to persevere in the revolutionary struggle and
strive to win ever greater victories under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism-
Maoism

Uphold, defend and advance the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin,
Stalin and Mao!
Carry forward the revolution against imperialism, revisionism and
reaction!
Glory to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
Long live proletarian internationalism!
Long live Marxism-Leninism-Maoism!

Joint Press Statement

8-8-2006

On Recent Debates

The Communist Party of Nepal(Maoist) and the Communist Party of
India(Maoist)  jointly  re-assert  their  firm  commitment  to  proletarian
internationalism, mutual fraternal relations, on the basis of MLM. All tactical
questions being adopted in the respective countries are the sole concern of
the parties operating there. Both parties will seek to learn from the positive
experiences of the other party as also the experiences of the Maoists who
comprise the ICM.

While doing so we shall continue debates on ideological, political and
strategic issues on which we differ in the true democratic traditions of the
international communist movement. These debates and discussions will take
place  bilaterally  and  also,  occasionally,  publicly.  Such  differences  are
inevitable as struggles in the sphere of ideas are inevitable in a class society,
which, as Engels said, is a reflection of the class struggle in society. Lately a
section of the media has tried to blow out of proportion differences that
have been expressed by the two parties publicly. It is in the interests of the
reactionaries that Maoists divide and split continuously. It is then no wonder
that a section of the media has sought to exaggerate the differences in India
and Nepal.

The two parties once again re-assert their firm unity in the spirit of
proletarian internationalism while continuing healthy debates and discussions
on issues on which we differ.
On Lebanon

The CPN(Maoist) and CPI(Maoist) jointly condemn the brutal attack
of the America-backed Israeli regime against the people of Lebanon. In the
name Of attacking the guerrilla resistances they have resorted to mass
September 2004 - August 2014  251

massacre, killing about 1,000 and displacing 25% of the population of
Lebanon. The Zionist genocidal regime, acting as the front paw of the US
imperialists, is becoming more and more fierce throughout the world, and
this is yet another adventure against an independent country.

Not satisfied by being bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan, the US
stooges are facing stiff resistance in Lebanon. The attack on Lebanon is
fraught with great dangers as the forces fighting there have the strong backing
of Syria and Iran. If the war escalates it can engulf the entire West Asia.

Even in South Asia the US imperialists are more and more openly
intervening in the countries of the region. Particularly in Nepal and India
they  have  been  directly  intervening  in  the  suppression  of  the  Maoist
movements. As  part  of  their  direct  intervention  the  US  officers  have
themselves been training the RNA and even entering every sphere of society
to subvert the ongoing anti-monarchial movement. In India the US diplomats
have been openly visiting Chhattisgarh and the military-run jungle warfare
camp as part of their plans to suppress the Maoists.

We, the Maoist parties of Nepal and India strongly condemn the blatant
aggression of Lebanon and call for the immediate withdrawal of all Israeli
troops and an end to the bombing of civilian targets by the Zionists. The
two parties also call for the immediate end to the interference by the US in
the internal affairs of Nepal and India and the other countries of South
Asia.

Press Release of the 4th Conference of the CCOMPOSA

CCOPOSA has successfully completed its 4th conference recently in
August 2006. This conference was held in a situation where the U.S., the
foremost enemy of the people of the world, and its lackeys are carrying
forward their all out onslaught on the masses through out the world and the
oppressed masses are valiantly fighting against it. Though it turned Iraq and
Afghanistan into regions of horrifying butchery, the heroic resistance of the
masses has already bogged it down forcing it to seek a safe way out. The
valiant people of Lebanon and Palestine are fighting out the Zionist murderers
who are backed by the U.S. In South Asia, U.S. hatched-up conspiracies
with India expansionism to kill

the New Democratic Revolution in Nepal has been blocked and the
revolution continues, giving rise to a wider and powerful upsurge against
the hated monarchy and gaining new victories. Elsewhere in India and
Bangladesh  masses  are  scaling  new  heights  on  the  torturous  road  of
revolution though the fascist and reactionary ruling classes are killing

hundreds of brave sons and daughters of revolution. Particular mention
must be made of the brutal Salwa Judum campaign in Dandakaranya (India)
which has been successfully beaten back by the Maoists. In Bhutan the
budding Maoist movement has courageously taken up the task of mobilising
the masses for revolution.

In July, one of the founding member of CCOMPOSA com. Kamrul
Master of Communist Party of East Bengal (Marxist-Leninist) Red Flag
[CPEB(ML) Red Flag] was arrested and cold bloodedly murdered by the
Bangladeshi ruling classes. Another founding member com: Sunil Roy of

CPI(Maoist) is imprisoned. In the 2 years since the last CCOMPOSA
Conference more than 1300 Maoists have laid down their lives for the
cause of revolution.

The conference started by paying homage to martyrs, among them
another of its founder memebers, com: Karam Singh of the CPI(Maoist).
Its discussions reflected the revolutionary struggles taking place and the
determination to forge ahead.

The conference has decided to enhance co-ordination and co-operation
among the Maoist forces in its various fields of activity among the broad
masses of South Asia. It resolved to fight against India’s expansionist designs
in South Asia under imperialist guidance. In its resolutions the conference
paid  homage  to  martyrs,  condemned  the  cold  blooded  murders  of
revolutionaries and repressive campaigns against struggling people, called
on the people and join the movement for the release of political prisoners,
condemned US and Indian expansionist conspiracies in Nepal, exposed the
sham reforms of the Bhutan King, and declared solidarity with the people
of Lebanon and Palestine. It called on the oppressed peoples of South
Asian countries to join the struggles against Indian expansionism and
imperialism, particularly against the main enemy US imperialism and turn
South Asia into a flaming field of revolutionary struggles.

December 2006

Draft Resolution from the International Seminar

Held in Nepal in December 2006

This International Seminar is taking place at a time when the imperialists
are going into a deeper crisis and US imperialism is getting bogged down in
their wars of aggression facing blows by the peoples of these countries as
witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan. The situation is developing where the
genuine communists, the Maoists, have the opportunity to make great
advances throughout the world.

We do recognize that  at this juncture the communist forces of the
world are weak and strengthening the Maoist parties in the ICM is a major
task to advance the revolution under the leadership of the proletarian parties
in the varied countries of the world.

In order to do this we, the Maoist Parties and Organisations from the

various countries of the world, resolve to:

1) Build closer ties amongst the genuine Maoists worldwide through
regular bilateral contact and multilateral meetings on the basis of Marxism-
Leninism-Maoism

2) Advance the peoples’ wars and revolutions in our respective countries
3) To be in the forefront of all anti-imperialist struggles of the world
and  thereby  give  effective  leadership  to  the  growing  worldwide  anti-
imperialist movements

4) Jointly undertake studies of the changes taking place in the international

situation to further refine our tactics.

5) Jointly undertake studies of the histories of earlier revolutions,
particularly of Russia and China, and the internationals to draw lessons and
thereby refine our methods and forms of struggle and organization to advance
the revolution to higher levels.

6) Issue joint statements from time to time on international events

September 2004 - August 2014  255

7) Develop proletarian internationalism on a deeper basis and specifically
assist  the  great  Nepal  revolution  for  the  consummation  of  the  New
Democratic Revolution.

We call on all genuine Maoists worldwide to come closer and make
Himalayan efforts to step by step minimize their differences on the basis of
MLM and thereby act as the true vanguards of the international proletariat.

US Imperialism: Hands off South Asia !

People of South Asia, Arise & Kick Out US & their Lackeys!

Recently US imperialism has not only increased its financial penetration
of the countries of South Asia they directly and blatantly interfere in the
internal  affairs  of  the  country,  both  politically  and  militarily.  Now
ambassadors are openly intervening in various hot spots of the countries
and military advisors are training puppet forces for counter-insurgency against
the struggling people of the region. In Nepal the notorious Moriarty openly
intervenes in the internal affairs of Nepal against the Maoists.

In Pakistan from the beginning the US military has been directly involved
for years; in Nepal US military advisors have been training the RNA troops
and they back the monarchy and are trying to disrupt the on going process
involving the Maoists; in Bangladesh the US has conducted military exercises
and earlier directly visited Maoist areas of terror by the Bangla Bhai and
now directly and openly intervening in the ongoing elections; and in India
recently high level military exercises have been conducted between the
forces of the two countries, US consulate officials have personally   visited
Chattisgarh in the counter-insurgency operations against the Maoists, an
FBI office has been opened in Delhi, direct training has been given to
counter-insurgency forces in jungle warfare schools, signed a high-level
nuclear deal with the US and the Indian expansionists are fast becoming the
front paw of US imperialist intervention in the region.

Earlier the intervention used to be subtle, now it is crude, blatant and
aggressive. Ever since imperialist globalization the imperialists, particularly
the US imperialists, have been aggressively pushing finance capital into

September 2004 - August 2014  257

every single sphere of the economies of the respective countries. They
have utilized the multilateral agencies like the IMF, World Bank and WTO
to change laws, regulations and policies to suit imperialist interests. Together
with this massive onslaught of finance capital have come greater and greater
domination, control and interference of countries of South Asia by US
imperialism.

It is this growing intervention in the countries of South Asia that is
creating havoc with the lives of the people and by ganging up with the local
reactionary ruling classes they push the fascist policies and terrorist forms
of rule in all these countries.

We call on the people of all countries of South Asia to resist this US
onslaught on their respective countries and smash all their traitorous lackeys
within these countries. We call on the oppressed people of South Asia to
build further bonds of unity to jointly fight US intervention in the region
and their local reactionary rulers.

CCOMPOSA Calls on the Peoples of South Asia to
Oppose the Growing Intervention of Indian Rulers

and US Imperialists in South Asian Countries

The Indian rulers seek total domination of the countries of South Asia
acting as the gendarme of the US in this region. At the recently held SAARC
Summit it went so far as to propose a South Asia Parliament seeking to
undermine even the existing limited sovereignty of the South Asian countries.
Earlier they had proposed a common currency for the region to further
consolidate their economic hegemony in the region. At the SAARC Summit
it continued to push SAFTA {South Asian Free Trade Association) in order
to dominate the markets of the region and allow the unhindered free flow
of goods made in India {mostly by the big comprador houses and the
TNCs} to all countries of South Asia.

CCOMPOSA CALLS for the disbanding of SAARC and the setting up
genuine forums of people to people relations between the countries of
South Asia.

In addition the US has been aggressively and blatantly intervening in
the internal affairs of all countries of South Asia. Their ambassadors are
acting as de-facto extra-constitutional powers dictating terms and making
open statements. Not only that they are directly involved in the counter-
insurgency operations and are in the forefront to push for fascist measures
against the struggling people of the region.

Lately, the Indian rulers, backed by the US, have been even more
crudely intervening in the internal affairs of neighboring countries and even
more crudely crushing the national aspirations for self-determination of the
Kashmiri, Naga, Manipuri, Assamese, etc people.

In Nepal, the Indian ruling classes have been playing an active role to

September 2004 - August 2014  259

diffuse the democratic aspirations of the Nepalese people and prop up the
reactionary elements after isolating the Maoists. They have been instigating
the Madheshi people of the Terrai against the Maoists, in league with the
Nepalese monarchy. Hindu fundamentalists have been particularly active in
setting up vigilante gangs to murder activists as happened in Gaur where 28
Maoists were killed. Recently these gangs murdered a Central Committee
member of YCL {Young Communist League} in the Terrai region together
with another comrade. The Indian ambassador has, of late, been pro-active,
roaming in the interiors of Nepal offering large sums of money for schools,
hospitals, roads, etc in order to wean away the masses from the influence
of the Maoists. In addition the Indian para-military have fired on and killed
the Bhutani refugees of Nepali origin, residing in Nepali camps, from returning
to their motherland and have been fully involved in the US conspiracy to
transport 60,000 refugees to the West as some modern day form of slave
labour. The US imperialists and Indian rulers have been working together
to prop up the reactionaries and neutralize the Maoists. CCOMPOSA strongly
condemns the role of the Indian rulers and US in Nepal and demands that
they stop meddling in the affairs of Nepal and the India people bring to
justice the murderous gangs operating across the Nepalese border.

In Bangladesh the Indian rulers have utilized the present army-backed
caretaker  government  to  push  through  massive  deals  for  Indian  big
comprador houses. They have sought to help the Tatas to make massive
investments there and lately the Mittals have signed a gigantic deal in the
energy sector of Bangladesh. The Indian ambassador has been actively
acting in the country together with the US ambassador in the dealings
between  the  various  political  parties  and  the  caretaker  government.
CCOMPOSA demands that the large natural wealth of poverty stricken
Bangladesh be utilized for the development of their own country and people
and not robbed by Indian compradors and the US imperialists.

In Sri Lanka they openly threatened the government when it sought
arms from China and Pakistan. The Indian rulers have already imposed
humiliating  free-trade  agreements  on  Sri  Lanka.  They  have  also
surreptitiously been assisting the Sri Lanka government to crush the just
aspirations of the Tamil people for a Tamil Elam. CCOMPOSA demands
the scrapping all these unequal agreements and supports the just struggle of
the Tamil people for their self-determination from the jack-boots of the Sri

260   Internatioal Messages and Statements

Lankan ruling classes.

In addition the Indian rulers continue to maintain and tighten their vice-
like grip over the small countries of the region like Bhutan, Malldives, etc
and continue their attempts to bully Pakistan utilizing the Kashmir card.
Particularly they continue to forcibly maintain the oppressed nationalities
within Indian hegemony. Not only does the Indian army of occupation
crush their just demands with utmost brutality, they have been pitting one
section of the people against the other to drown their just struggles in oceans
of blood. This is to be seen in Nagaland, Manipur, Assam, Kashmir and
elsewhere. Besides the Indian rulers have launched a genocidal campaign
to crush the revolutionary movement in India itself, massacring hundreds in
Chhatisgarh under the banner od Salwa Judum and killing in fake encounters
throughout the country. CCOMPOSA condemns these brutal fascist attacks
and demands that the people of the oppressed nationalities be allowed to
determine their own future and the immediate and total withdrawal of Indian
army and para-military forces from all these regions.

South Asia has become a burning cauldron of revolutionary, democratic
and nationality movements. CCOMPOSA supports all these just movements
and calls on the peoples of the countries and nations of South Asia to unite
against their common enemy, the Indian expansionism; to kick the US
imperialists  out  of  the  region,  and  intensify  their  struggle  against  all
reactionaries in the region.

JOINT DECLARATION

23-8-2007

Declaration to Reaffirm the Significance and Relevance

of the Anti-revisionist Struggle and the GPCR

We,  the  undersigned  Marxist-Leninist,  Mao  Zedong Thought  and
Marxist-Leninist-Maoist  parties  and  organizations,  hereby  issue  this
declaration to reaffirm the significance and relevance of the struggle against
modern revisionism starting, in 1956 in opposition to the revisionist content
of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU)
in February 1956, leading to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from
1966 to 1976 and continuing after the bourgeoisie seized power in China in
1976.  We do so after one year of activities celebrating the 50th anniversary
of the anti-revisionist struggle and renewing our commitment to pursue this
struggle.

We honor and pay the highest respect to Comrade Mao Zedong for
leading the Communist Party of China (CPC) and all Marxist-Leninist parties
in  the  struggle  against  modern  revisionism.    He  promptly  caused  the
publication  of  the  editorial  of  the  People’s  Daily,  “On  the  Historical
Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat” in April 1956 in response
to  the  20th  Congress  of  the  CPSU.  In  this  Congress  the  Khrushchov
revisionist clique repudiated in February 1956 under the pretext of opposing
“personality cult” the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism and the great
revolutionary achievements of the Party of Lenin and Stalin in building
socialism, fighting fascism and leading the international communist movement
for more than 30 years.

The actions of the Soviet revisionists headed by Khrushchov laid bare
the phenomenon of modern revisionism in opposition to the proletarian
dictatorship and put the Soviet Union on the road of capitalist restoration.
They reorganized the Soviet Party the state, the economy and the cultural
institutions in order to subvert Marxism-Leninism and the socialist system.
They  opposed  the  dictatorship  of  the  proletariat  and  propagated
bourgeois populism with the notions of “party of the whole people” and

262   Internatioal Messages and Statements

“state of the whole people” and bourgeois pacifism with the notions of
“peaceful transition,” “peaceful competition” and “peaceful coexistence”.
They undertook to undermine the international communist movement and
pushed “peaceful coexistence” as the general line to oppose proletarian
internationalism and to attack the international communist movement and
the national liberation movements.

Revisionism destroyed all the formerly socialist countries.  It transformed
these into colonies of social imperialism, deprived the revolutionary world
movement of its revolutionary center, destroyed revolutionary parties and
brought  confusion,  division  and  liquidationism  into  the  international
communist and working class movement. It had a corroding effect on the
proletarian class struggle and the anti-imperialist struggle and led to defeats
involving heavy losses. The process of the international proletarian revolution
has been set back for decades.

There are ideological, political, socio-economic and cultural causes of
modern revisionism.  The major causes include deviation from materialist
dialectics, abandonment or waning of the proletarian class stand and class
struggle,  worship  of  outdated  or  revisionist  Soviet  examples  and  the
degeneration of a great number of bureaucrats and intellectuals due to their
petty bourgeois social conditions and ways of thinking, which are the
gateway to modern revisionism as full bourgeois ideology.

Hankering for personal privileges, nepotism, careerism, abuse of power,
enrichment and other forms of self-interest, those afflicted with the petty
bourgeois  mode  of  thinking  gain  the  upper  hand  among  the  leading
functionaries in the party, state, economy and cultural institutions and give
rise to modern revisionism as bourgeois ideology and as a platform for
bourgeois policies.

Comrade Mao defended the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism
against the line of modern revisionism.  He denounced the revisionists for
sowing confusion in the international communist movement and generating
disorder and uprisings against the socialist cause in Yugoslavia, Poland,
Hungary and elsewhere in Eastern Europe.

Under the direction of Comrade Mao, the delegation of the CPC pursued
the anti-revisionist line in the Moscow meetings of the communist and
September 2004 - August 2014  263

workers’ parties in 1957 and 1960.  Thereafter, the Marxist-Leninists led
by the CPC launched an international ideological struggle on a comprehensive
range of issues against the modern revisionists centered in the Soviet party.
Further on, the Marxist-Leninists led by Comrade Mao proceeded to
the criticism and repudiation of the phenomenon of monopoly bureaucrat
capitalism and social imperialism during the long regime of Brezhnev.
Monopoly  bureaucrat  capitalism  masqueraded  as  socialism  while  the
bureaucrats and businessmen connived to steal from the state sector. In
international relations, the Soviet revisionists engaged in socialist phrase-
mongering and in the practice of imperialism.

Comrade  Mao  did  not  rest  content  with  the  critique  of  modern
revisionism as it had arisen and grown in the Soviet Union and in the other
countries of the Soviet bloc. He examined and analyzed the growth of
modern revisionism in China, arising from both homegrown factors and
external influences. Thus, he united the leading anti-revisionist revolutionaries
in the CPC, who rallied forces to launch the Great Proletarian Cultural
Revolution in May 1966 in order to carry out the theory of continuing
revolution under proletarian dictatorship. This is to combat revisionism,
prevent the restoration of capitalism and consolidate socialism.

The theory and practice of continuing revolution under the dictatorship
of the proletariat through the GPCR constituted a new and higher stage in
the development of Marxism-Leninism.  It posed a series of problems in
the building of socialism, for a whole historical epoch in transition from
capitalism to communism, and brought up the basic principles and methods
for solving said problems, involving the existence of classes and class struggle
in socialist society, the relations of the social base and superstructure, the
mass line, cultural revolution, revolution and production, succession by the
youth, leadership in the factories and communes and the formation of the
organs of political power.

Many of these issues were not understood or could not have been
understood through the decades of socialism in the Soviet Union.  The
launching of the GPCR reflected an understanding and summation of that
Soviet experience, and was an unprecedented political mobilization of the
masses against revisionism, this time in the CPC.

tremendous odds and against powerful adversaries. But soon after his death,
the enemies of the Chinese proletariat and people made a coup and reversed
his proletarian revolutionary line in carrying out socialist revolution and
construction. Since then the new bourgeois rulers in China have launched
the most brutal attacks against the Chinese workers and peasants. While
they have continued to claim the title of the “Communist Party of China”,
they in fact, are now the worst oppressors and exploiters and abusers of the
Chinese people.

There  are  manifestations  of  China’s  all-round  retrogression  and
degradation to the status of being a big-comprador neocolonial adjunct of
the US and other imperialist powers. China has completely tied itself to the
policy of imperialist globalization pushed by the US and other imperialist
powers.  But  China  is  also  trying  to  become  a  relatively  autonomous
imperialist power, extending its economic investment and political influence
on a world scale in places such as Africa, Latin America and Asia. It is
reminiscent of a generally backward and poor but imperialist Russia before
the Bolshevik revolution.

The full restoration of capitalism in China and in the former Soviet bloc
countries vindicates the teaching of Comrade Mao that socialism is lost
when the revisionist line prevails within the ruling communist or workers’
party and that eventually the bourgeoisie within the party and state succeeds
in unleashing a coup and overthrowing the proletariat.

Comrade Mao has bequeathed to us a legacy with which we can combat
and defeat modern revisionism and with which we can revive and further
develop the forces of socialism. We are alert to and oppose the continuing
dangers of revisionism, modern revisionism and other forms of opportunism.
We  reaffirm  Comrade  Mao’s  revolutionary  theory  and  practice  of
continuing revolution under proletarian dictatorship through the Great
Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We condemn the betrayal of socialism and
of Comrade Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line by the Liu Shaoqi-Deng
Xiaoping clique and the new Chinese bourgeoisie.

September 2004 - August 2014  265

We renew our determination and efforts to carry out the historic mission
of the proletariat, which is to carry out a new-democratic and socialist
revolution and construction. All the evils that have beset the former revisionist-
ruled countries drive us to uphold Marxism-Leninism-Maoism against modern
revisionism and to pursue the revolutionary cause of socialism.

Upon the temporary success of modern revisionism against Marxism-
Leninism and the dictatorship of the proletariat, monopoly capitalism headed
by US imperialism has been able to launch the worst attacks against the
proletariat and the oppressed peoples, such as “free market” globalization,
racism, repression and wars of aggression. In response to the escalation of
oppression and exploitation, the proletariat and people are intensifying their
resistance through armed struggle and other forms of resistance.

It is not enough to defend Marxism-Leninism and Maoism in order to
generate a new upswing in the struggle for genuine socialism. The international
Marxist-Leninist and working class movement must draw the lessons from
the defeat of socialism by revisionism and from the successes of the 50
years of struggle against revisionism.

The building of Marxist-Leninist parties world-wide, the overcoming of
the fragmentation, the strengthening proletarian revolutionary parties closely
linked to the masses and their international revolutionary collaboration are
the essential ideological, political and organizational preconditions for the
liberation of humankind.

It is the internationalist duty of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist parties to unite
and to arouse, organize and mobilize the proletariat and people in their
respective countries and in the world at large in the struggle for national
liberation, democracy and socialism against imperialism, revisionism and
reaction.  We renew our commitment to persevere in the revolutionary
struggle and strive to win ever greater victories under the guidance of
Marxism-Leninism-Maoism.

Uphold, defend and advance the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin,
Stalin and Mao!
Reaffirm Marxism-Leninism-Maoism against modern revisionism!

REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE’S FRONT (RPF)

Joint Declaration

22-10-2008

A two days joint meeting was held between the CPI (Maoist) and the
Revolutionary People’s Front (RPF) at the Council Head Quarters of the
Revolutionary People’s Front on 21-22 October 2008. At that meeting,
both sides have unanimously condemned the hegemonic capitalist design of
the Indian regime and have agreed to consolidate the mutual understanding
and friendship, further more agreed firmly to stand hand in hand to overthrow
the common enemy, the present Indian reactionary regime and to gain
political goals of the respective two Parties.

The CPI (Maoist) strongly condemned the annexation of Manipur by
the Dominion of India, which was done under the instigation of reactionary
Indian Congress led by Gandhi, Nehru and Sardar Patel and their hegemonic
and colonial designed. The so-called Merger Agreement of Manipur with
the Dominion of India was, indeed, illegal and unconstitutional. The very
verdict was given by the two days convention on Manipur Merger Agreement
held at GM Hall, Imphal, on 22-29 October 1993. Now it becomes the
voice of the people of Manipur.

A revolutionary movement was born under the leadership of Comrade
Hijam Irabot to liberate Manipur from the yoke of the British remnant
India style Black Raj. As a continuation of liberation struggle and a total
revolution, the Revolutionary People’s Front has been struggling for their
political rights to self-determination. Therefore, the CPI (Maoist) upholds
the true nature of the revolutionary movement in Manipur and support the
liberation struggle recognizing the sovereignty of Manipur.

Moreover, the Revolutionary People’s Front stands and supports the
revolutionary movement of the CPI (Maoist) as well. The downtrodden
proletariat Peoples of all over India are facing the suppression and subjugation
of the reactionary regime of India since the departure of the British Raj
from the Indian soil. Under the new leadership of Comrade Charu Majumdar

September 2004 - August 2014  269

and Comrade Kanhai Chatterjee two streams of revolutionary movement
was  founded  in  1969  to  give  the  Indian  people  the  rights  to  political
emancipation. Comrade Charu Majumdar was assassinated by the repressive
Indian  regime  in  the  police  custody  and  Comrade  Kanhai  Chatterjee
embraced martyrdom in 1982 suffering from kidney failure. In 2004, the
two  revolutionary  streams,  CPIML  (People’s War)  and  MCC  (Maoist
Communist Centre) merged and formed one new Party – The Communist
Party of India (Maoist). Following the footsteps of the two founder leaders,
the CPI (Maoist) is still struggling arms in hand to overthrow the Indian
reactionary regime and to bring the victory of the Indian people.

The Revolutionary People’s Front firmly believes that the general Indian
peoples  are  not  our  enemy.  In  fact,  they  are  under  privileged  and
downtrodden people who are gravely suffering under the semi-feudal, semi-
colonial regime of India.

Joint Declaration:

Today,  the  22nd  days  of  October  2008,  after  having  a  thorough
discussion, session for two consecutive days, in every aspect of the two
organizations the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and the Revolutionary
People’s Front, unanimously declare the following agreement:
1. That, both sides will honour and support the Sovereignty of the two
countries (the Sovereignty of India and the sovereignty of Manipur).
2. That, both sides will extend full morale and political support to each
other in the liberation struggles to overthrow the common enemy, the Indian
reactionary and oppressive regime, respectively.
3. That, both sides deem to recognize and honour the historically endorsed
territorial integrity of the two countries viz. Manipur and India.

On Protest Actions  and Statements
in Front of Indian Embassies in Europe

Today with the initiative of ATIK (Confederation of Workers from
Turkey) in various cities in Europe Den Haag, London, Vienna, Bern and
Frankfurt  protest actions in front of the India Embassy’ were held.  The
protest’s were against the “Operation Green Hunt” which was first initiated
in November 2009 by the Indian state, especially in very poor areas.
Until now, there are reports in the international media reporting about
the violation of the most fundamental human rights. In the statement it
says:

“With the military operation “Green Hunt”, the Indian government
has lunched a broad repressive and brutal “annihilation offensive”
against the people. In the poorest regions in India, with the military
operation “Green Hunt”, the Indian government has launched a broad
repressive and brutal “annihilation offensive” against the people. In
the poorest regions in India the legitimate people upraising with the
support of the ethnic minorities against this adversity, gains more and
more sympathy worldwide

“In those areas in where the peoples’ movement is the strongest,
valuable resources were found, resources that the Indian government
wants to sell to the multinational cooperations- and even if only partly-
has sold some of it, between the closure of the contracts and the big
money are the poor, isolated tribes and revolutionaries “Naxalites”, who
wage an organized, successful uprise against this situation. Or as the
Indian progressive writer Arundhati Roy says “the government doesn’t
give  the  people  anything  else  then  violence  and  disrespect. And
now  they  want  to  take  away  from  them  the  last  thing  that  they
have, their land”.

September 2004 - August 2014  271

“For  this  reason  we  oppose  the  operation  “Green  Hunt”  and  the
repression policies of the India government. We demand an immediate end
of the operations, banishing, torture and release of all political prisoners in
India. We are in solidarity with the just rebellion of the Indian people for
social liberation and self determination of the indigenous people like the
Adivasis.”

These  protests  and  solidarity  actions  were  supported  by  different
democratic migrant organizations and political parties. The primal supporters
of this call are:

Platform of Democratic Mass Organizations-Europe (DEKÖP-A)
ATIK (Confederation of Workers from Turkey in Europe)

AvEG-Kon (Confederation Of The Oppressed Migrants In Europe)
YEK-KOM (Föderation der kurdischen Vereine in Deutschland)
MLPD Rhein-Main region (rhs@mlpd.de), BIR-KAR Frankfurt

These organizations declare their unlimited solidarity with the Naxalite
Liberation Movement and the Adivasi people and that the protests will
continue until this repression in India will finally come to an end.

Unite to Oppose the Unprecedented Brutal War – Operation
Green Hunt-by the Indian reactionary rulers against Maoist

revolutionaries and the oppressed people of India!

Hail the heroic resistance by the revolutionary people of India
led by the CPI(Maoist) to the most barbaric attack unleashed
by the Indian State in the interests of the imperialists and a tiny

elite of parasitic corporate plunderers!!

The reactionary rulers of India have unleashed the cruelest war on
the oppressed toiling people, particularly the indigenous adivasi masses
inhabiting the vast region stretching from West Midnapore-Purulia-
Bankura in West Bengal to North Andhra and North Telangana. The
waron the poorest of poor of India is called the Operation Green Hunt.
The troop mobilization in this region is mind-boggling. The total number
of central forces is over 66,000 and the state’s police forces deployed for
the anti-Maoist operations in the seven states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand,
Orissa, West Bengal, Bihar, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh is close to
two hundred thousand. Thus almost a quarter of a million troops of the
central and state governments are engaged in military operations against
the Maoists and the indigenous people. This number is more than the US
troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan or the combined armies of Sri
Lanka and Nepal. Encompassing over a third of the territory of India, it is the
biggest ever war zone in the Indian sub-continent till date that surpasses the
total area and populations of several countries in the world.

Everywhere in this vast war zone one finds police and paramilitary camps;
fortified stations and concrete bunkers with heavily armed uniformed personnel
aiming at whoever comes their way; construction of airstrips and helipads on a

September 2004 - August 2014  273

war-footing; mine-proof and bullet-proof vehicles; jungle warfare schools; laying
of roads, communication towers and school buildings for accommodating the
swarming hordes of policemen; and helicopters hovering over the forests for
air-dropping the central forces and preparing satellite imagery of the region;
conspicuous presence of the Indian Army for imparting training and giving
logistical support; and such other war- related activity.

On the other side are hundreds upon hundreds of empty villages evacuated
by the inhabitants after being burnt down by the police or fearing brutal attacks
by the invading mercenaries of the Indian State. Everywhere one finds cold-
blooded murders of men, women and children; abductions and illegal detention
of innocent adivasis for indefinite periods; mutilation of the dead bodies and
refusal to hand over the dead to their kith and kin; rapes and gruesome murders
of hapless women; burning of food grains and destruction of property; closing
down weekly bazaars and preventing adivasis from going to markets to fetch
their minimum needs; occupation of schools and all government and panchayat
buildings by the police forces depriving children of education; in short, leading
to conditions of genocide of the indigenous people of India. Despite being a
signatory to the Geneva Convention and other International Conventions, Indian
government shows the least concern for implementing the provisions of these
Conventions and violation has become the general rule. The Indian Constitution
too has become a scrap of paper signifying absolutely nothing for the vast
masses in the war zone. The rulers are using the Constitution and the rhetoric
of “rule of law” as a fig-leaf for perpetrating the worst violations of human
rights. The arson and mayhem, death and destruction, caused by the armed
goons sent by the Indian State mock at the so-called democracy of India. These
crimes against the people under the direct supervision of the Union Home
Minister Chidambaram are comparable to the crimes of the Nazis under Hitler,
or the crimes of a Pinochet in Chile, or the military dictatorships in Latin America
of the 70s and 80s.

This unprecedented cruel attack on the Maoist revolutionaries and
the poorest of the poor is being carried out with the twin-objective of
destroying the emerging alternative models of people’s power in the form
of organs of revolutionary people’s power in the remote countryside that
have also become alternative models of genuine development basing on
people’s needs on one hand; and snatching away the lands, forest wealth

274   Internatioal Messages and Statements

and mineral wealth of this vast region on the other. Towards this end,
MOUs worth around Rs. 35 lakh crore have been signed with various
imperialist companies and the comprador corporate houses of India by
just three state governments of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Orissa.

Today the deepening global economic crisis has a devastating impact on the
Indian economy due to its total dependence and servitude to the imperialists.
To offset the effects of the crisis the international capitalist class is keen on
seeking new pastures for ensuring profits. Its eyes are set on the alluring abundant
cheap raw materials and other natural resources in the adivasi regions. Some of
these regions remain hitherto unexploited due to the presence of Maoist
revolutionaries and militant resistance from the masses.

The all-out war unleashed by the imperialists and the reactionary rulers of
India is not only to eliminate the Maoist revolutionaries who are providing
leadership to the people’s struggles but also to crush every form of democratic
movement and suppress every form of dissent in the name of a looming Maoist
threat. This McCarthyism practiced by the Indian State under the Sonia-
Manmohan-Chidambaram gang is leading to a fascist atmosphere in all spheres
and bringing into one’s mind the bitter days of Emergency under the same
fascist Congress party.

The CCOMPOSA warns the Indian ruling classes that no revolution can be
crushed by the brute force however they appear to be mightier today. It is
people and people that who can decide the history. All unjust wars are destined
to face their waterloos. Indian ruling classes have thrust this brutal war to
facilitate the smooth plunder to the Indian compradors and Imperilists. People
raise like toranadoes and smash this counter revolutionary offensive. More
Dantewadas are bound to happen.

The CCOMPOSA calls upon the people of entire South Asia to rally against

this unjust war, thrust upon the indigenous people and the Maoist

revolutionaries, by the imperialist-backed Indian State. Let us express our
solidarity to the fighting people of India, particularly in the vast Maoist guerrilla
zones and guerrilla bases where the people led by PLGA are waging heroic
battles against the massive armed offensive of the enemy. Indian expansionism
is the common enemy of the people of all countries of South Asia. Defending
the Maoist movement in India, the organs of revolutionary people’s power or

the embryonic forms of people’s democratic governments and condemning the
blood-bath unleashed by the rulers on the people is a foremost task before all

From the Workers and Proletarian Uprising to the Proletarian Revolution!
 The crisis of the imperialist system goes on with is impact on the
proletarians  and  the  masses  throughout  the  world.  The  imperialist
bourgeoisies in the world take advantage of the crisis to restructure the
capitalism on a world scale, to “improve” in the interest of their classes for
their profits.

 For the oppressed people: hunger and poverty; for the proletarians in
the imperialist countries, increasing unemployment, cost of living, sackings,
closing factories, precariousness.

This also feeds the inter-imperialist contradictions for the control on
the world market and the strategic geo-political regions. This raises and
pushes the factors of the inter-imperialistic and reactionary wars in the
world.

 For the people in the world, imperialist wars of aggression, invasions,

neo-colonialism.

  For  the  proletarians,  police  State,  modern  fascism,  racist  laws,

oppression of youth and women.

  The  working  class  and  oppressed  peoples  need  more  and  more
revolutionary  organizations  to  advance  and  strengthen  itself  and  a
revolutionary strategy to overthrow the bourgeoisie (and all ruling classes)
and seize the power.

September 2004 - August 2014  277

 Until the proletarian and oppressed will not be in power, it is an illusion

to think that its destiny can get better!

 The workers struggles and more generally the struggles of the people -
against all aspects of imperialist ‘globalization’ as the privatizations of the
education, for the regularization of the migrants, against the police repression,
etc. - develop in opposition to this system that does not give to the majority
of the people any perspective but exploitation, oppression and poverty. In
France we could see several resolute struggles as well as in other countries.
In these workers’ struggles, the base (affiliated to union or not) is opposed
to the officials unions’ chiefs, which are reformist and conciliatory.

 These struggles must be coordinated, generalized and raised in the
framework of a revolutionary perspective of overthrowing the reactionary
governments and bourgeois States for the proletarian seizure of the power.
 This will not occur spontaneously. We must build in all countries the
revolutionary tools, the new party of the working class, the new type
communist party, the Maoist Communist Party, based on the revolutionary
Marxist-Leninist-Maoist theory and the summing up of the historic experience
of the communist movement !

Today the Maoist Communist Party has the goal to advance in its
construction in the fire of the class struggle, closely linked to the masses,
for the socialist or new democratic revolution, with the strategy of the
people’s war reaching its peak with the seizure of power, in accordance
with the conditions of each country, to build a new society, without crisis,
exploitation, oppression, poverty, to advance to socialism, toward the class
less communist society.

To strengthen the Maoist Communist Parties, where they exist, and to
build them, where they do not, is the task of all the proletarians, all those
are struggling in the different fronts and want to give themselves the tools
to overthrow the system.

 Support the people’s war in India, support the revolution in Nepal!
The people’s war in Peru experiences a new advance under the leadership
of the Communist Party of Peru and goes on in the Philippines, Turkey
and, particularly, in Asia.

In India, the people’s war led by the Communist Party of India (Maoist)
progresses fighting back against the government ban and the massive military
offensive against the revolutionaries and the masses of India, the operation
called “Green Hunt”. But the armed people effectively resist and gain an
even larger support throughout the country.

Our task is to practice proletarian internationalism, support this struggle

and make it known.

In Nepal the situation evolves more and more toward the clash between
the revolutionary camp, led by the Unified Communist Party of Nepal
(Maoist), and the reactionary camp.

After a 10-years-long people’s war and 4 years of peace process the
country is at the border of a new decisive clash. Who will lead the country,
whether the bourgeois or the people’s camp, depends on who will win this
conflict. At the same time, there is the danger of a foreign intervention of
the India supported by US. We must support the revolution in Nepal because
it opposes the imperialism.

28-7-2010

In India an impetuous people’s war against the Indian bourgeoisie and
the imperialism is developing and spreading more and more in nearly one
third of the districts of the country. It is not simply a guerilla waged by few
thousands of fighters, coming from the castes and tribal areas of the country.
It is a real people’s war, led by the Party of the proletariat of India, the
Communist Party of India (Maoist), in which are involved – or is supported
by – millions of poor peasants, women, “untouchables, “ fighting to free
themselves and it has already took big areas throughout a dozen of states of
the Indian Federation.

The people’s war began where the root of the riot, the poverty, the
tribal and capitalistic exploitation, the caste oppression, the plundering of
the natural resources were deeper and therefore the contradictions brought
by the Indian capitalism ruled by the imperialism were sharper. Today this
people’s war is winning masses of young people, students, democratic and
revolutionary intellectuals also in the cities and gains attention and support
over the world.

Against the people’s war, the Indian State, supported by the imperialists,
launched a giant repressive offensive called “Green Hunt,” a real manhunt
that hits the poor masses in India as animals to exterminate. The Indian
State launched an internal military offensive against the people, waged by
hi-tech-armed troops, police units and paramilitary militias, in order to spread
terror and genocide in the villages, with raids, crop destroying, massive

280   Internatioal Messages and Statements

rapes and killings, selective murders, mass detentions and disappearing –
like the recent genocide offensive occurred in Sri Lanka against the Tamil
people and liberation movement.

All this with the illusion to drown in blood the struggle of the people for
their liberation, with the silent/consent of the imperialist governments of
US, Europe, Russia, and their mass-media. The crimes of the Indian State
found the internal opposition of a wide front of intellectuals – including the
prominent representative of the world anti-globalization movement, the writer
Arundhati Roy. And in all countries of the world political activists denounced
those crimes and mobilized to stop “Green Hunt.”

A world campaign of information and solidarity has been launched by
ICAWPI (International Campaign Against War on the People in India). But
we need more than the condemnation of the crimes of the counter-revolution
in India. The masses led by the Communist Party of India (Maoist) are
writing a historical chapter of the class clash in the world between, on one
side, the imperialism and the reactionary bourgeoisies and, on the other
side, the proletariat and the people of the world. The development of the
people’s war in India is a new proof that the revolution is the main tendency
in the world today.

It shows again that Maoism, the Marxism-Leninism of our era, is the
command and guide of the world revolution against the imperialism in crisis.
The vanguard proletarians must understand that the advance of the
people’s war in India seriously questions the strength balance, not only in
the South-Asian region but also on a world scale. That is why we, Maoist
and revolutionary parties and organizations, launch a big campaign of support
and  call  to  form  an  International  Committee  of  Support  to  organize
conferences, meetings, demonstrations in various countries, particularly in
the heart of the imperialist beast.

With people’s war in India towards the victory!

IN SOUTH ASIA (CCOMPOSA)

Press Release of CCOMPOSA

23-03-2011

The 5th Conference of the Co-ordination Committee of Maoist Parties
and Organisations of South Asia (CCOMPOSA) was successfully completed
in early March. The delegates took up analysis of the current political
situation in order to identify its main features. They noted the fall out of the
global crisis, the devastations it has caused among the masses, the wave of
struggles in imperialist citadels triggered by the crisis and the recent series
of popular upsurges in Arab countries, apart from developments in South
Asia such as the successful withstanding of Maoists in India of the state’s
counter-revolutionary offensive. The Conference observed that “though in
an uneven way, the objective situation all over the world, including in the
imperialist countries, is developing favourably for revolution. The main
trend  of  revolution  is  strengthened.  In  comparison  to  the  favourably
developing objective situation and its demands, the subjective strength of
the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist parties still lags. Nevertheless, greater attraction
of people towards Marxism and socialism all across the world is a very
positive sign.”

As observed in the Political Resolution it adopted, “This Conference is
being held when the Indian new democratic revolution continues to confront
the serious challenge of “Operation Green Hunt” launched by Indian state.
While the initial victories in beating back this ‘war on the people’, politically
as well as militarily, give better conditions to the revolutionaries, the gravity
of the challenges they face remains. The revolution in Nepal is at the
crossroads. The powerful potential of great victory exists along with the
serious danger of harsh defeat. Imperialism and Indian expansionism are
openly intervening in Nepal to destroy the revolution and is directly instigating

determinedly  towards  the  completion  of  new  democratic  revolution.
Notwithstanding  vigorous  attempts  on  the  part  of  revolutionaries,  the
people’s wars in Bangladesh and Bhutan have yet to cut through enemy
repression  and  develop  it  to  a  higher  level.  Maoist  revolutionaries  of
Afghanistan are engaged in preparation of people’s war amid US occupation.
In Sri Lanka the task of reorganising the Maoist party is still on the agenda.
All this shows the challenges faced by the Maoists of this region in the
present juncture. Guided by Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, the unity among
the  constituents  of  CCOMPOSA  and  their  joint  activities  will  surely
strengthen the revolutionary struggles and initiatives going on in the different
countries of South Asia and be a catalyst in facing up to these challenges
and seizing the opportunities. This has a significance going far beyond the
boundaries of South Asia.”

It concluded, “Seize power where it is possible, develop ongoing people’s
wars to higher levels, prepare and initiate people’s war where parties exist
and build up parties where they don’t - this should be the working orientation
of Maoist revolutionaries. It is a declared fact that CCOMPOSA has been
formed to unite the Maoist revolutionaries of South Asia and fight Indian
expansionist  hegemony  and  imperialism  in  the  region. Apart  from
accomplishing its responsibility in this region, CCOMPOSA, as a part and
parcel  of  the  international  communist  movement,  must  discharge  its
internationalist duties to further the cause of world proletarian revolution.
South Asia is ripe for new democratic revolution. Let all of us strive to
develop ongoing people’s wars, initiate new ones, accomplish new democratic
revolution in our respective countries and establish South Asia as a strong
base area of the world proletarian revolution. This and only this is the way
the Maoist revolutionaries in South Asia can contribute to the advance to
socialism and communism and thereby fulfil their proletarian internationalist
duty.”

The Conference called upon all Maoist forces in South Asia to join the
CCOMPOSA and strengthen it and thus further advance in the common
aim of making South Asia a blazing center of world revolution.

CCOMPOSA condemns the aerial attack of Libyan cities by the US,

zone” by the United Nations Security Council Resolution no. 1973. The
recent history is replete with vivid memories how the attempts to implement
of “no fly zone” were escalated into a full war of occupation in Iraq resulting
in colossal human tragedy. The war preparations in the name of “Operation
Odyssey Dawn” by these blood sucking imperialists show that they are
determined to do another Iraq in Libya. CCOMPOSA is confident that
Libyan as well Arab people understand the designs of these imperialists that
it is not the Libyan people’s interest behind the war frenzy, but the precious
oil  that  is  driving  these  plunderers  in  toppling  Gaddafi’s  regime. The
compradore Indian government, instead of standing against the Imperialist
attempts of interference in the ongoing civil war in Libya, by firmly opposing
the Resolution, played a role of cunning fox, by abstaining in the voting.

Internationalist May Day

May Day 2011

People want revolution!
Proletarians want the Party for revolution!
Comunists want internationalism and a new international organization!
This year’s May Day comes at a time of unprecedented protests and
uprisings all around the world.In the Arab world and Persian Gulf, the
youth, the proletarians and the broad masses took to the streets and toppled
or tried to topple, one after the other, the dictatorial regimes subservient to
imperialism.

In the heart of the imperialist countries, working class struggles, general
strikes, rebellions of students and youth are opposing the policy of reactionary
governments and the development of a modern fascism aimed at shifting
the burden of the crisis on to the backs of the masses, bringing layoffs, job
insecurity, intensification of exploitation and attacks on education, health
care and basic social services.

Struggles and rebellions are ranging from China to the USA, from Russia
to Latin America. Particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq, imperialism, mainly
U.S. imperialism, is suffering blows that prevent it from realizing its plans
of occupation, invasion and geo-strategic control on important areas of the
world. Its plans to sanctify Zionist occupation in Palestine through sell-out
leaders have been checked.

People’s wars are the strategic reference for the proletarians and peoples

of the world.

The people’s war in India successfully withstands unprecedented attacks
by the enemy and is able to expand and advance. The people’s war in Peru
persists and recuperates. The people’s war in the Philippines advances. In
Turkey, revolutionary struggles led by the Maoists advance along the people’s
war strategy. In other countries of South Asia it is being prepared, for
initiations and new advances.

September 2004 - August 2014  285

In Nepal, 10 years of people’s war have created the conditions for the
advancement of Nepali revolution. This revolution is now at a complex
crossroads and must be supported against the counter-revolution waged by
internal and external enemies as well as against the reformists who try to
undermine it from within.

The protracted people’s war is necessary to defeat the enemy both in
countries oppressed by imperialism and the imperialist countries themselves,
according their own specificities.

It represents a new and sharpening phase of the class struggle that
expresses the revolutionary aspirations of the proletariat and the world
peoples.

All this indicates that the main contradiction at the world level is that
between imperialism and oppressed people, while the contradiction between
the  proletariat  and  the  bourgeoisie  and  as  well  as  of  inter-imperialist
contradictions are sharpening. In the context of the spreading crisis, the
revolution emerges more and more clearly as being the main trend in the
current world.

The economic crisis of imperialism, far from being resolved, widens
and deepens according to the laws of uneven development and as a result
of the contention on the world market and the tendency towards a maximal
extortion of surplus value. The “financialization” of the economy— the
main immediate cause of the crisis — tends to reject any control. The use
of surpluses from China’s, India’s and Brazil’s economies can’t ensure
more than a temporary recovery, which opens the door to new and even
more distressing crisis.

The struggling and uprising proletarians and popular masses demand
the building of revolutionary parties at the height of the current clash of
classes; and that process of organization is developing.

We need communist parties based on Marxism-Leninism-Maoism able
to lead the class struggle in all fields and aimed at seizing the political power
without which it is not possible for the proletarians to overthrow the capitalist
and imperia- list system.

Maoist Communists strive to answer this need for a scientific and decided

286   Internatioal Messages and Statements

leadership for the proletarian class struggle, by fighting all kinds of revisionist,
reformist and dogmatist deviations. Our class can rely on the huge amount
of experience through 140 years of struggles and revolutions, from the birth
of the Glorious Paris Commune through the peaks of the October Revolution,
the Chinese revolution and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We
must learn from both our victories and defeats, as well as from our mistakes.
Within that wave of struggles, uprisings and people’s wars, Marxist-
Leninist-Maoist communists should put proleta- rian internationalism into
practice in order to unite proletarian struggles and those of the oppressed
peoples against imperialism in crisis and remain firmly united with masse,
as they make history.

Communists must achieve a new unity of the international communist
movement based on Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and build the international
organization that we need today.
Imperialism has no future!
The future belongs to communism!

JOINT DECLARATION 2014

Another May Day Comes…

1-5-2014

Another May Day comes, in a world where the misery and deprivation
suffered by billions of people is immensely aggravated by the prolonging
crisis of the imperialist system. Millions have been thrown out of jobs.
Social security is cut down. Growing price rise further depresses living
standards. Medical treatment and higher education become atrociously
expensive. Meanwhile the perpetrators of this merciless system workout
even more vicious anti-people measures, all the while obnoxiously flaunting
their swelling wealth and boasting of billionaire lists.

Another May Day, where immigrant workers are forced to labour as
slaves, where the trafficking of women and children continue to increase in
staggering proportions, where women continue to suffer the brutality of
rape and murder no matter whether its ‘backward’ Afghanistan or ‘advanced’
USA, where minorities are isolated and suppressed, where the youth are
hounded and persecuted, where the demand for something as minimal as
fair wages and living conditions is cut down with bullets and imprisonment.
Another May Day, in the midst of environmental devastations caused
by the blind pursuit of profit, in the midst of the rapidly widening chasm of
inequality within each society and between imperialist and oppressed countries.
Oppression and exploitation generates resistance. And this resistance
grows. This world is witness to the growing wave of class struggles and
popular rebellions in country after country. This is a world of turmoil. A
wide range of forces are being propelled into struggle against the system.
The grooming of the streets is no doubt insufficient for a radical break, for
the building of a new society. But it opens up tremendous opportunities for
connecting with a whole new generation and winning them over to the
revolutionary mission of communism. It paves the way to revolution. This
is principal. It must be firmly grasped.

Just a decade or so ago, the existence of the proletariat itself was
questioned. Class struggle was declared redundant and considered to be
replaced by movements of ‘multitudes’. Today the world is marked by
repeated occasions of militant workers struggles, not just in countries like
India or China, but even more so in the citadels of imperialism. There is
every reason for this. For all the tall talk of the technical wonders of the
21st  century,  whether  in  the  killing  fields  of  the  garment  industry  in
Bangladesh, the slave labour camps of Qatar, the labour barracks in China,
or the sweat-shops of imperialist countries, the conditions in which the vast
majority of proletarians labour are as atrocious as those of the 18th century.
Meanwhile, explicitly oppressive methods of control and ever increasing
workloads in the modern centres of wage slavery increasingly suffocate the
proletarians.

At a different dimension, the ravages of globalisation have deeply marked
the oppressed countries. Privatisation and liberalisation have wiped whole
sectors of employment and small business. Working conditions, already
bad, have become unbearable. This was aggravated by the global crisis. In
inverse proportion to the worsening of living conditions of the vast majority,
corruption and profit taking by the rulers have reached astronomic peaks.
While the miseries of the people multiply, the rulers obstinately pursue
grandiose projects eying the fat cuts they will get.

All of this underlies the repeated outbursts of rebellion seen in the
world. Business cannot go on as usual. In a certain sense this is true of the
imperialists and their lackeys too. Their growing contention amply indicates
this.

Another May Day comes, in a world crying out for revolution, for
communism; a day for the class conscious proletariat and their vanguard,
the Maoists, to take stock of the world transforming mission of the proletariat
and the great traditions of proletarian internationalism.

Today there is no socialist country. Not even a government that can be
broadly qualified as progressive, pro people. There is much, much, to be
done. But there are also factors that give strength and confidence in pursuing
the world emancipatory mission of the proletariat ? the clarity of Marxism-
Leninism-Maoism and the deepening of the struggle against revisionism of

September 2004 - August 2014  289

all hues including those of the Prachanda-Bhattarai clique and Avakianism,
the wave of struggles seen all over the world, the people’s wars in India and
the Philippines and its reorganisation or preparation in some other countries,
the strengthening of internationalist ties and activities among Maoist parties
and organisations.

Building on these strengths, the Maoists must creatively develop forms
of organisation suitable for orienting the rebellious energy of the streets
towards revolution, with the building and strengthening of Maoist parties at
its center. They must take up the task of building an international organisation
of Maoist parties and organisations. This must be the core of an organised
international anti-imperialist front of the proletarians and oppressed peoples.
Thus the Maoists will be able to establish and develop Marxism-Leninism-
Maoism, realise a new unity of the international communist movement,
place it at the van of worldwide people’s struggles and fully unleash and
realize the revolutionary potential of the present world.

Imperialism has no future! The future belongs to communism!
Proletarians and oppressed people of all countries, unite!
Down with imperialism and all its watchdogs!
Long live proletarian internationalism!
       Long live world proletarian revolution!

We must unite with the proletariat of  all the capitalist countries,
with  the  proletariat  of  Japan,  Britain,  the  United  States,
Germany, Italy and all other capitalist countries, for this is the
only way to overthrow imperialism, to liberate our nation and
people and to liberate the other nations and peoples of the world.
This is our internationalism, the internationalism with which
we oppose both narrow nationalism and narrow patriotism.

- Mao, 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' (1939)

In the fight for complete liberation the oppressed people rely first
of   all  on  their  own  struggle  and  then,  and  only  then,  on
international assistance. The people who have triumphed in their
own revolution should help those still struggling for liberation.
This is our internationalist duty.

- Mao, 'Talk with African friends' (1963)

The people of the countries in the socialist camp should unite,
the people of the countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America
should unite, the people of all the continents should unite, all
peace-loving countries should unite, and all countries subjected
to U.S. aggression, control, intervention or bullying should unite,
and  so  form  the  broadest  united  front  to  oppose  the  U.S.
imperialist policies of  aggression and war and to defend world
peace.

Just Patriotic Struggle against U.S. Imperialism' (1964)
