Press Release:                                                                                                            June 1st, 2010 
 

CONDEMN THE CONSPIRACY OF THE RULING CLASSES 
AND THE MEDIA HYSTERIA TO IMPLICATE MAOISTS IN 

THE JNANESWARI EXPRESS TRAGEDY!! 

 
 
The  removal  of  panroles  on  the  railway 
track near Jhargram in West Bengal leading 
to  the  accident  of  Kurla-bound  Jnaneswari 
Express  and  consequent  deaths  of  150 
innocent  civilians  and  injuries  to  over  200 
passengers  is  highly  condemnable.  The  CC, 
CPI(Maoist),  expresses  its  deep  sorrow  at 
the  tragic  incident  and  shares  the  suffering 
and  pain  of  the  families  of  the  deceased. 
Strangely,  the  tragic  incident  which  took 
place on the intervening night of May 28/29 
is  being  used  by  West  Bengal  government, 
the police and some ruling  class parties like 
the  Hindu  fascist  BJP  and  the  social  fascist 
CPI(M)  to  tarnish  the  image  of  our  Party—
CPI(Maoist)—and  gain  legitimacy  to  the 
counter-revolutionary  war  unleashed  by  the 
Indian  State  against  the  poorest  sections  of 
the Indian society led by the Maoists. 
 
Baseless  accusations  against  the  Maoist 
revolutionaries  are  part  of 
the  dirty 
disinformation  campaign  let  loose  by  the 
reactionary  rulers 
their  police-
intelligence  agencies  and  their  pet  media. 
For two days after the incident the police did 
not  even  confirm  whether  a  blast  had 
occurred at the site let alone finding any clue 
about the  involvement of the Maoists or the 
PCAPA.  However,  they  came  up  with  the 
theory  of  Maoist  involvement  with  the 

through 

 

1 

argument  that  the  area  is  a  hotbed  of  the 
Maoists,  and  Maoists  had  been  targeting 
trains  for  some  time.  The  entire  media  has 
been  playing  to  the  tune  of  the  conspirators 
by  running  banner  headlines  that  “Maoist 
terrorists”  had  taken  the  lives  of  innocent 
people,  Maoists  are  blood-thirsty  hounds 
and such trash which only insane people can 
say.  Would  anyone  in  his  senses  ever 
imagine  that  the  CPI(Maoist),  which  had 
been  fighting  for 
livelihood  and 
liberation  of  the  people  for  over  four 
decades,  which  had  sacrificed  thousands  of 
its  leaders  and  cadres  for  the  cause  of  the 
oppressed, which has no other interests than 
the  interests  of  the  people,  can  harm  the 
lives of those very people? 
 
It is the reactionary rulers who would stop at 
nothing to acquire power and retain it. They 
would  set  fire  to  their  own  houses  to 
discredit others and gain the sympathy of the 
people.  It  is  universally  known  how  Hindu 
fascists  like  Narendra  Modi  had  engaged 
VHP,  RSS  and  Bajrang  Dal  hoodlums  to 
unleash attacks on Muslims; how a Sri Ram 
Sene  is  hired  to  create  riots  in  Karnataka; 
how  a  Raman  Singh  kills  adivasis  and 
accuses the Maoists of having committed the 
crimes.  A  fascist  Hitler  had  set  fire  to  the 
Reichstag, 
the 

the  blame  on 

land, 

to  put 

 

these 

ruling 

reactionary 

Communists  and  begin  a  witch-hunt. 
Likewise, 
rulers 
themselves  had  organized  the  sabotage  of 
railways  with  the  aim  of  discrediting  the 
Maoists.  With  an  eye  on  the  elections  and 
unnerved  by  their  fast-eroding  social  base, 
the  social  fascists  think  they  can  gain 
sympathy  through  such  dirty  tricks.  The 
reactionary 
class  parties  have 
degenerated  to  such  a  low  level  that  they 
will go to any extent to be in power. 
 
Strange  is  the  manner  in  which  most  of  the 
media  had  reported  on  the  tragic  incident. 
While  they  ran  headlines  attributing  the 
cause  of  the  sabotage  to  the  Maoists,  they 
report in their columns that the enquiry is on 
and  that  Maoist  involvement  is  suspected. 
How  can  the  media  deliver  its  judgement 
even  before  any  evidence  is  found  or 
enquiry  conducted?  What  morality  do  these 
reporters,  some  of  them  quite  renowned  at 
that,  possess  when  they  pass  judgements 
based  on  their  own  ideological  biases? 
Worse,  some  media  sources  have  not  even 
published  or  aired  the  statement  issued  by 
our  Party  representative  in  West  Bengal 
denying  our  involvement.  The  media  is 
becoming 
anarchic, 
irresponsible  and  unaccountable.  While 
propagating 
without 
investigation,  the  media  does  not  even  have 
the courtesy  to admit its  gross mistakes and 
irresponsible  accusations  when  the  truth 
comes out in the open. It had done the same 
kind of false propaganda against the Muslim 
community after the blasts in Mecca Masjid 
in  Hyderabad,  Ajmer  Dargah  blast,  Goa 
blast  and  so  on  and  remained  unapologetic 
about  its  false  and  biased  reporting  even 
after  it  was  clearly  proved  that  these  blasts 
were the handiwork of Hindu fascist gangs.

tragedy.  We 
consider  this  as  a  deep  conspiracy  by  the 
rulers  to  defame  the  Maoist  revolutionaries 
and  gain  legitimacy  to  their  suppression 
campaign.  We  warn  the  reactionaries  who 
have  been  vomiting  venom  against  Maoists 
to  stop  their  vicious  campaign  and  hurling 
false  allegations.  We  call  upon 
the 
democratic  and  progressive  forces,  civil 
rights  groups  and  people  at  large  to  see 
through the intrigues and diabolic designs of 
the  reactionary  rulers  in  spreading  such  lies 
and 
the  Maoist 
revolutionaries.  We  demand  an  impartial 
enquiry  into  the  incident  to  bring  out  the 
truth.  Our  Party  will  never  hide  the  truth 
from the people. When we commit a mistake 
we  frankly  admit  it,  apolgise  to  the  people 
from  the  depths  of  our  hearts,  and  assure 
them  that  we  would  not  repeat  such  a 
mistake.  This  has  been  the  hall-mark  of our 
Party  in  all  its  history.  In  this  particular 
incident of the Jnaneswari express the Party 
leadership  so  far  is  not  aware  of  any 
involvement  of  its  cadre  but  if  it  is  found 
that  anyone  close  to  our  Party  had  indeed 
carried out the sabotage of the railways, then 
we  will  take  stringent  action  against  them 
and  openly  admit  the  lapse  on  our  part. We 
will  investigate  into  the  incident  and  come 
out  with  the  facts  in  the  shortest  time.  We 
assure  the  people  of  our  country  that  there 
will  not  be  any  attacks  on  trains  in  future 
and  we  will  instruct  our  Party  cadre  to 
abstain from such acts as they can cause loss 
of ordinary lives.
