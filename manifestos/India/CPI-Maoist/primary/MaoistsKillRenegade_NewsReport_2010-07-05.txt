AURANGABAD: CPI(Maoist) cadres killed a former colleague after abducting him late on Friday night 
in Aurangabad district for extracting money in the name of their organisation. The slain Maoist’s body 
was later found lying near a village temple on Saturday morning.  
 
Umesh Mehta (20), a native of Burma village under Kutumba police station in Aurangabad district, had 
left for his brother, Akhilesh Mehta’s house at Natwa Tikar village on his motorcycle on Friday. As 
Mehta was standing at the betel shop owned by his brother, three CPI(Maoist) cadres came on a 
motorcycle and forcibly took him away with them.  
Later, on Saturday morning his body was found lying near a temple at Pheku Bigha village.  
 
The district police confirmed that Umesh Mehta was previously an active member of the banned 
CPI(Maoist). Several cases were lodged against him with Kutumba police station and he had also been to 
jail earlier, the police said.  
 
Sources said that though sometime back he had dissociated himself from the CPI(Maoist) work, he used 
to extract money using its name.
