Condolences on the demise of democrat and people’s well-wisher Swami Agnivesh !

The Central Commi(cid:425)ee of our Party conveys condolences to the family and friends of Swami Agnivesh who passed 
away on 11th September, 2020 at the age of 80. The demise of Agnivesh is a great loss to the movement for a 
democra(cid:415)c, progressive and na(cid:415)onality libera(cid:415)on movements and movements for people oriented society. He 
fought for the abolishment of bonded labor. He raised his voice against the viola(cid:415)on of Cons(cid:415)tu(cid:415)onal rights. He 
a(cid:425)ended as the chief guest to the conven(cid:415)ons and conferences of revolu(cid:415)onary mass organisa(cid:415)ons many (cid:415)mes.

When Opera(cid:415)on Green Hunt was launched in mid-2009, the then Central Home Minister Chidambaram requested 
Swami Agnivesh to arrange for talks with our Party. He readily accepted and came into contact with Comrade 
Cherukuri Rajkumar, our Party spokesperson at that (cid:415)me. Correspondence was in progress but the government 
came out with its true inten(cid:415)on. It followed Rajkumar along with journalist Hemachandra Pande on their way in 
2010 July and arrested them. Both of them were killed in fake encounter in Adilabad forest. Agnivesh was severely 
disturbed and shocked at the incident. He stated he felt ‘guilty’ for ini(cid:415)a(cid:415)ng talks and that he felt Chidambaram 
deceived him. Swami Agnivesh who wanted genuine democra(cid:415)c process for the sake of the people was made a 
scapegoat due to the a(cid:427)tude of the central government in the process.

Agnivesh went to Dandakaranya on few occasions. In 2011, he was a(cid:425)acked together with an IAS oﬃcer by the Koya 
Commandos and Salwa judum goondas and their families on their way to meet the people of Tadimetla. Agnivesh 
was accompanying the oﬃcer to provide house hold goods to the vic(cid:415)ms of more than 250 families of three tribal 
villages in Tadimetla area of South Bastar, whose houses were burnt by the government armed forces. The police 
forces under the guidance of the then Bastar IG SRP Kalluri blamed the Guerillas for burning the houses. In 2011 the 
people’s mili(cid:415)a along with guerillas arrested 5 policemen in retalia(cid:415)on to their unceasing a(cid:425)acks in East Bastar. 
Agnivesh went to the place along with few other friends of the people and requested the guerillas and got them 
released.

Agnivesh was in Pakul in Jharkhand in 2016 on an invita(cid:415)on of local Adivasi people to a(cid:425)end a func(cid:415)on. Mob-
lynching was going on at a severe pace at that (cid:415)me in the state and in the country. The saﬀron goons were against 
the presence of a democrat and a(cid:425)acked Agnivesh in a shameless manner.

At the present juncture where Brahmanic Hindutwa forces rule the law, the demise of Swami Agnivesh is a loss to 
the ﬁght against fascism. The CC appeals to all the democrats, progressive minded and well-wishers of the people of 
the country to imbibe the spirit of Agnivesh and become part of the ongoing an(cid:415)-fascist movement in the country.
