 
Dear  Friends!  This  is  the  list  of  people  killed  by  state  armed  forces  in  Dandakaranya  from  10  August  2009,  when  the  Operation  Green  Hunt  was 
commenced, to 31 December 2010. Amidst immense state terror prevailing in Dandakaranya, it was not so easy to collect the names and other details of all 
those persons killed by state forces. Here, we have recorded the names of civilian people as well as armed Maoists, killed in both fake and real encounters. 
There may certainly be some more killed persons whose names were not known to us or gone completely unreported. 
 
going on upon the people of Dandakaranya. 

We request all of you to publish this list in your  newspapers and websites so that the whole world could understand what kind of  state voilence is 

AN APPEAL
