LIST OF POLICE KILLINGS IN DANDAKARANYA (From 10 Aug 2009) 

IN OPERATION GREEN HUNT  

 

(Updated on June 1, 2011. Yet, it's incomplete as we are still unable to record every incident of killing taking 
place almost on a daily basis. Some incidents of killings have completely gone unreported. Some people were 

abducted and their whereabouts were not revealed till now by police.) 

 

SO, OUR STRAIGHT QUESTION IS WHY THIS HUE AND CRY 

OVER KILLINGS OF POLICE, SPO AND PARAMILITARY FORCES, 

WHO ACTUALLY ARE THE MERCILESS KILLERS OF INNOCENT ADIVASI PEOPLE? 

 

AND WHY NOT 'NO TEARS' ON THESE LIVES LOST (GIVEN BELOW)? 

 

DO ASK THE RULERS OF OUR COUNTRY WHO RECITE 'DEMOCRACY' AND 

'CONSTITUTION' ON EVERY BREATH... 

WHO HAD KILLED THESE PEOPLE AND WHY?
