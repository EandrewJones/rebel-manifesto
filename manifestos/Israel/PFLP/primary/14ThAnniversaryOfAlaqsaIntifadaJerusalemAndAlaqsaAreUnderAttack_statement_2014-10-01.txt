On the occasion of the 14th anniversary of the beginning of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa remain under threat from occupation forces, said the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The events of late September and early October 2000 remain fresh in the mind of every Palestinian, said the Front, recalling the occupation forces attacking mass marches of Palestinians in occupied Palestine â€™48, killing 13 martyrs in cold blood and wounding dozens while arresting hundreds, as they sought to suppress the upsurge of our people for Jerusalem and al-Aqsa in all cities and villages under occupation.
Jerusalem and al-Aqsa mosque continue to be under threat and in danger, said the Front; Jerusalem faces a systematic, rapid and extremely dangerous policy of Judaization, where at the hands of occupation soldiers and settlers, 23 Palestinian homes were confiscated in Silwan, while more Palestinian homes are destroyed each day as mass arrests and administrative detention against Palestinian leaders continue. Furthermore, the storming and invasion of the al-Aqsa grounds by settlers and soldiers takes place on a frequent, at times almost daily, basis.
The escalation of Zionist aggression and Judaization of Jerusalem requires that all national and Islamic forces, and the PLO Executive Committee, give a high priority to the situation facing Jerusalem, and to defend the Palestinian and Arab character of Jerusalem as part of our program of struggle everywhere the Palestinian people are located, and to support the resistance to the repressive, racist, threatening actions of the occupier in Jerusalem at Palestinian, Arab and international levels.
