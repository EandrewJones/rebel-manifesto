Twenty comrades of the Popular Front among the prisoners announced on June 11 that they are joining the hunger strike until the victory of the prisoners’ demands or death, in response to the call of the administrative detainees on hunger strike for 48 days. The 20 new hunger strikers are also saluting the martyred comrade Khaled Bakir, on the anniversary of his loss.
They issued the following statement:
We are joining the battle of the open hunger strike, until the triumph of the demands of the administrative prisoners, or until we die with them. In response to the call of the administrative prisoners…from behind the Zionist prison bars…from the darkness and damp of the cells, and from the narrow walls that also contract our chests in pain as we learn of our fellow prisoners in adminstrative detention, chained and restrained in the hospitals of the Zionist enemy…adter this, our eyes see the horizon of death tht awaits the administrative prisoners, and in response to their call, which they wrote with blood…and as a step in solidarity with the administrative prisoners and an action of protest against the local, Arab and international silence. On the basis of our values of comradely, national, ethical and human struggle in our veins that have not dried up as a result of the spread of the winds of globalization and imperialism that undermine our Arab traditions, we declare our cry of solidarity and pain, and join in the sacrifice for those hungry and suffering in the hospitals of the enemy. We are committed to all that the administrative prisoners are committed to, to donate as they have donated, and for our hunger to join their hunger and our pain to join their pain in the Palestinian body.
They are a model of sacrifice and selflessness, as are the Palestinian prisoners, as are the martyrs, Al-Hakim [George Habash], Abu Ali [Mustafa], Abu Jihad, [Sheikh Ahmed] Al-Yassin, [Fathi] Shikaki, Omar al-Qassem and Said Shawwa…these words are our testament and our commitment to the people and their prisoners…resistance until victory; victory is inevitable.
