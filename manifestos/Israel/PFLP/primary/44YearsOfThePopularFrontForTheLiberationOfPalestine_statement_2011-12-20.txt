On the road to liberation and return…
On the path of resistance…
The English language website of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is re-launching its updated site, marking the 44th anniversary of the founding of the PFLP on December 11, 1967.
The 44th anniversary of the founding of the Front stands as an occasion for the PFLP to emphasize its struggle for national unity, unified resistance, and confrontation of the occupation – and to reaffirm our steadfast commitment to continue the struggle until every prisoner is freed, every refugee may return, and all of Palestine – from the river to the sea – is liberated.
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine salutes all of its international friends and comrades on the occasion of this anniversary, at a time of great struggle around the world.
We apologize for the long absence and delay of our website and are committed to restoring the resources you have found here, as well as adding new and updated content and features. We encourage you to contact us via email at english@pflp.ps.
 Together, we are united on the road to the liberation of Palestine and the freedom of our people!
