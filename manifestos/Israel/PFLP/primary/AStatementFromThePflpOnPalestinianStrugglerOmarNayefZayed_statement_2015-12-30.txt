We warn the Palestinian embassy in Bulgaria against any attempt to hand over the Palestinian struggler Omar Nayef Zayed to Bulgarian authorities with the purpose of his extradition to the Zionist occupation state, and we hold the Palestinian ambassador Ahmed Al-Madbuh responsible in his personal and official capacity for the full political consequences that may arise from such a decision.
Further, we demand that the Palestine Liberation Organization and all Palestinian institutions and legal bodies immediately intervene and shoulder their responsibilites to protect the life of the freed prisoner Zayed. The issue of this struggler is not an individual or personal matter but a national and collective issue.
We in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine reject the pressure exerted by the Palestinian embassy in Sofia on the freed prisoner and his family in violation of its political, legal and moral responsibilities, and we consider this behavior as a complete abandonment of its national role and submission to the dictates, conditions and demands of the Zionist state.
We have made all necessary efforts on the internal Palestinian level, with the institutions of the Authority and with the PLO, including the Palestinian presidency and Foreign Ministry, however these efforts have not been respected by the Authority or the ambassador who has chosen to stand in contradiction of the national position.
The struggler Omar Nayef Zayed has sought refuge in the Palestinian embassy as the natural and only site that can provide him and every Palestinian with legal and political protection, but with great regret we note that ambassador Madbuh has practiced all forms of psychological pressure and direct threats to hand over the struggler Zayed to the Bulgarian authorities if he does not leave the embassy within 24 hours.
We in the PFLP call on all to uphold their national responsibilities to prevent the enemy from achieving their goals and setting a dangerous precedent that will have serious impacts and results and negative repercussions, not only on the struggler Zayed but on Palestinian communities in Europe and especially veteran strugglers and former prisoners.
