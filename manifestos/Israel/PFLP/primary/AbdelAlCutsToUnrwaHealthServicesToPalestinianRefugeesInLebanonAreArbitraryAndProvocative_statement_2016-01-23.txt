UNRWAâ€™s policies of reducing health services to Palestinian refugees in Lebanon are dangerous, arbitrary and provocative and must be immediately reversed, said Comrade Marwan Abdel Al, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Lebanon.
In an interview, Abdel Al noted that there was a crisis between Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and UNRWA, due to the decision by UNRWA to reduce the funding that it provides for the hospitalization of Palestinian refugees in the camps in Lebanon, from 100% coverage in Palestinian Red Crescent hospitals, government hospitals and some contracted private hospitals, to 95% in Red Crescent hospitals, 85% in Lebanese government hospitals and 80% in some other hospitals, while canceling contracts entirely with some private hospitals and limiting the ability of hospitals to transfer Palestinian patients to private or public hospitals. In response, protests have quickly developed from one camp to another in rejection of this action.
Abdel Al said that the UNRWA actions can only be described as provocative, as the health services file is extremely sensitive as it directly affects the lives and health of the general public, and negatively impacts the reputation of UNRWA and its humanitarian role.
Abdel Al said that these actions come in a context of ongoing and fundamental changes in the operation of UNRWA, reducing its role, noting that this is a political action. In addition, he noted that there is a natural increase in health costs and keeping a flat budget is in effect a budget cut; furthermore, there has clearly been mismanagement of the health department which has created budget deficits that cannot be balanced on the backs of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.
