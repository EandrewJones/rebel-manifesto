Comrade Marwan Abdel-Al, a leader in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and head of its Lebanon branch, and Abla Sa’adat, Palestinian women’s leader, have continued their tour of Brazil following their participation at the sixth Congress of the Landless Workers’ Movement. Abla Sa’adat spoke at the Congress on behalf of the Campaign to Free Ahmad Sa’adat, calling for revolutionary forces around the world to put the Palestinian cause and the freedom of its prisoners on the agenda, and saluting the movement’s commitment to the cause. The conference included a salute to imprisoned PFLP General Secretary Ahmad Sa’adat and the Palestinian people.
The Marxist Trend of the Workers’ Party, the Communist Party of Brazil, and the Landless Workers Movement organized a political seminar in the trade union federation of Rio de Janeiro on February 19, where Comrade Abdel-Al spoke. Comrade Ivan Pinhiero, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Brazil, spoke at the event about the long relationship between his party and the PFLP, followed by Comrade Marcelo of the Landless Workers’ Movement, who discussed the support of the movement for the Palestinian people against the occupation, noting that they consider the Palestinian struggle a school for lessons in their own struggle.
Comrade Lewis Baker of the Marxist trend in the Workers’ Party said that “Israel” is a great catastrophe for humanity, with an ongoing onslaught against the Palestinian people. Comrade George Haj spoke on behalf of the Lebanese Communist Party in Brazil, discussing its unity of vision with the front and its common destiny with the Palestinian people, warning against Zionist military and economic infiltration into Latin American countries.
Abdel-Al gave the final address at the forum, speaking about developments in the region and in the Palestinian arena. He warned against the so-called Kerry plan and U.S. pressure pushing this plan, as well as the “security track” and “economic track,” comparing Kerry’s plan to an “Oslo II” to follow up on the devastating course of Oslo I. “The right of return will not be turned into a business deal,” said Abdel-Al, saying that the Zionist state, along with the US, were planning to “segregate the Palestinian people in racist ghettos.” He called for an alternative strategy to address the substance and the core of the struggle for the liberation and return to Palestine.

Comrade Sergio of the Marxist trend spoke about solidarity with the Palestinian people and the Popular Front, and his own experience living alongside Palestinians during the siege of Beirut in 1982.
Abdel-Al spoke about the impact of the crisis of the capitalist system on the Arab region, saying that neoliberalism has not brought freedom to a thirsty people but rather the opposite: a new bondage of underdevelopment and reaction. He discussed the view of the Front of current developments in the Arab world, and the Front’s view of revolution, freedom, progress and democracy. Addressing the Kerry plan, he rejected this attempted liquidation of the Palestinian cause and “new Oslo”, saying that the Front completely rejects these negotiations and that an alternative path is needed. In addtion, he pointed out the growing military and economic trade between the Brazilian government and “Israel,” and called on the Brazilian left to bring an end to this trade and boycott all of the companies and products of the Zionist occupation.
