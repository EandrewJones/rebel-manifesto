Comrade Marwan Abdel-Al, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Lebanon, strongly condemned “the car bomb explosions targeting various areas of Lebanon, in particular the bombing that killed former minister Mohammed Shatah and the bombing of Haret Hreik in the southern suburbs of Beirut.”
Abdel-Al noted that the Popular Front sees these bombings as aimed at filling the political vacuum by bloody means of strife and sectarianism to undermine Lebanon’s unity and civil peace, calling on all Lebanese to exercise care and wisdom in confronting the situation in the country, protecting peace and stability in order to overcome this era.
“All must be responsible with their words and not bring hasty charges about the identity of the killers. The murderers alone are responsible for their actions, but the Zionist enemy is the beneficiary of any such act,” Abdel-Al said.
