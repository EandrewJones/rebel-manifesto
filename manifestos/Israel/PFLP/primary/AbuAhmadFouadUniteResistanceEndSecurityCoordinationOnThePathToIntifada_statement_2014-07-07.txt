Comrade Abu Ahmad Fouad, Deputy General Secretary of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said on Sunday that the PFLP leadership has given clear instructions to the fighters of its armed wing, the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades, to strike against the Zionist occupation in order that it pays a price for the ongoing crimes against our people.
In an interview on Al-Mayadeen TV, he said that it is necessary to gather all Palestinian resistance forces in a unified plan to strike the enemy and produce significant losses for the army of occupation.
“Our call is for the formation of a joint operations room that defines objectives, distributes tasks….moving toward escalation of resistance and effective operations, not revealing capabilities and tactics, working to surprise the enemy and deal harsh blows,” said Comrade Abu Ahmad.
“The occupation is unlikely to risk an invasion of the Gaza Strip, because the losses would be signifcant, even though the Strip is still occupied by the blockade imposed upon it…the occupation’s bombing and destruction of infrastructure in Gaza will continue and will probably include attempts to assassinate leaders, whether military or political,” he said.
He emphasized the unity of the Palestinian people and land, whether in the West Bank, Gaza, Jerusalem or Occupied Palestine ’48, where our people are rising in a popular movement against the occupation; he called for rallies and actions inside the homeland and in exile and diaspora, emphasizing that the conditions now exist for the popular Palestinian movement in the West Bank, Gaza, Jerusalem and ’48 to develop into a popular Intifada that will impact the balance of power on the Palestinian, Arab and international level.
He demanded an immediate end to negotiations and security coordination from the monopolistic Palestinian leadership and for them to respect and comply with the Palestinian popular sentiment, which is clearly for resistance in all of its forms, including popular uprising and Intifada.
