The answer to the crimes of the occupation is held not only by Palestinians but requires Palestinian and Arab resistance, said Comrade Abu Ahmad Fuad, Deputy General Secretary of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, in a television interview with Al-Mayadeen TV on July 31.
He denounced the role of the United States and its strategic partnership with the Zionist state, highlighting the hypocritical statements denouncing the settler murder of 18-month-old Ali Dababsheh while providing billions of dollars in military aid to the Zionist military to kill Palestinian children, and using the veto in the United Nations to prevent any accountability for Zionist political and military war criminals.
In addition, Fuad said, “we must not allow the enemy to single out the West Bank, or Gaza, or Lebanon, or our people in Palestine 48, while the Arab world remain spectators; our responsibility is not to protect this or that region, but to stand together collectively to defend all of our people, in Gaza, the West Bank, Occupied Palestine ’48, and all of the Palestinian and Arab people, wherever they are.”
He denounced the role of the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian official positions as insufficient, noting that existing Palestinian consensus decisions have not been implemented at all, emphasizing the need to immediately end security coordination and sever the relationship with the criminal enemy. “The responsibility for this crime does not lie with the settlers only, nor with individuals, but with the entire state of the occupation and the Zionist project, that is based on the settler colonial conquest of our homeland,” said Fuad.
He reiterated his call for the abolition of the Oslo Accords, noting that they ended in reality long ago. He stressed that the logic of negotiations and bargaining has been deeply destructive to the Palestinian cause, to Palestinian refugees’ right of return and to holding the occupation accountable.
Fuad urged all to name streets and squares after the martyr Ali Dawabsheh, everywhere, so that his name remains a witness to the fascist, racist crimes of the enemy, and that the compass of Arab countries must be re-pointed towards Ali Dawabsheh, and toward Palestine.
