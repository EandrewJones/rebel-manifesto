“We are on the threshold of a new popular intifada,” said Comrade Abu Ahmad Fuad, Deputy General Secretary of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
In an interview with Al-Mayadeen TV, Fuad said, “The events taking place in Palestine, including the operations carried out by young people in light of the growing Israeli escalations and violations against our people, demonstrate that we are on the potential threshold of a massive popular intifada, as we will see through the coming period.”
He pointed out that “the next intifada is not necessarily like its predecessors, but it is possible to take on new methods and tools. We are at a stage which requires us to use all methods and means to make the enemy retreat from its plans in Jerusalem and defend the rights of the Palestinian people.”
“The Palestinian people have immense creativity in developing all methods to confront the occupation. The Palestinian people have arrived to the point of anger, and have found that the road best suited to confront the occupation is the path of resistance,” said Fuad.
