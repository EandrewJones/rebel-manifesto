Abu Ali Hassan, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said that the seriousness of the Oslo agreement is not in its conditions and its humiliating clauses and words, but in being a turning point and a qualitative leap backwards in Palestinian political consciousness, in terms of its reactionary thinking on Palestinian land and its relationship with the Palestinian people.
Abu Ali Hassan said that the Oslo accords were the first official Palestinian document that reduced Palestinian rights to “progress toward a solution,” that reflects the extent to which the leadership who sign rejected the possibility of liberation. Furthermore, he said that the importance of the Oslo accords also comes in the fact that it heralded a sharp split in the Palestinian political approach and perception of the Israeli state and Palestinian rights. He pointd out the importance of turning the tables upside down, cancelling the agreement and returning to the roots of the cause.
