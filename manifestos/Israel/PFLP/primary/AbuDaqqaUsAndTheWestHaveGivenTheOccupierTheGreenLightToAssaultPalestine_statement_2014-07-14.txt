“The brutal Zionist aggression has been waged against our people continuously for the sixth day in a row, and still Arab states and international human rights organization are maintaining their continuous silence towards this aggression,” which has killed over 170 and wounded well over 1000, said Comrade Maryam Abu Daqqa, a member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
“There has been massive destruction of homes. All of this is taking place with the support of Arab and international silence,” said Abu Daqqa, in an interview with Al-Mayadeen TV.
“There is no ‘truce’ with the Zionist enemy, because the Palestinian people are under occupation,” said Abu Daqqa. “The US administration and other Western countries have given the green light to the Zionist enemy to destroy the Palestinian people, as the Palestinian national liberation movement remains an obstacle confronting the hegemony of the United States over the region.”
Further, Abu Daqqa called upon members of the Palestinian leadership and ministers in the new reconcilation government to come to the Gaza strip while it is under attack by the Zionist regime, saying that “Gaza must not be left alone.” She urged popular actions in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Occupied Palestinian ’48, in the refugee camps and everywhere Palestinians are in exile and diaspora against this horrific aggression.
