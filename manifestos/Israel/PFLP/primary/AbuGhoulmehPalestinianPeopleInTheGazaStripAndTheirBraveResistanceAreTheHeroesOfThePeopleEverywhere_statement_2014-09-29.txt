The Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and their brave resistance are the heroes of the Palestinian people everywhere, said Comrade Ahed Abu Ghoulmeh, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine’s branch in prisons in a media statement. In the 51 days of aggression in July and August, they presented a legendary and paradigmatic model of steadfastness and resistance, confirming the centrality of resistance in Palestinian thought, action, and values. They have raised in the hearts of all of our people a feeling of pride, hope, achievement, self-confidence and assuredness in achieving victory, and opened new horizons and paths before our people and our cause, said Abu Ghoulmeh.
The resistance in Gaza is a “national treasure,” said Abu Ghoulmeh, saying that the resistance and its weapons are a national consensus and a strategic value of struggle, and that the Palestinian people have the right to practice all forms of resistance – popular, civil and military – as guaranteed by international law.
He stressed the importance of achieving national unity that was strengthened immensely by joint command in the field of resistance, in building a national leadership and a unified strategy and resistance that reflects the aspirations of our people for liberation and self-determination.
He also emphasized the importance of the popular embrace of the resistance and demanded an official embrace of the resistance with full political and legal support for the masses of our people and their resistance, first at the Palestinian level and at the Arab, Islamic and among the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, and among the supporters of Palestine around the world. He also emphasized the need to implement the demands of our people and the resistance during the aggression. He demanded the full and comprehensive end to all forms of the siege on the Palestinian people generally and on Gaza particularly, and the provision of all kinds of assistance to enhance the steadfastness of our people and thereconstruction and development of the Gaza Strip.
