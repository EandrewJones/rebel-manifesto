Comrade Emad Abu Rahma, member of the Central Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said that the latest aggression against Gaza, where four Palestinian martyrs were slain by occupation forces’ attacks, are not coincidental but instead part of a targeted, continuous and sustained aggression by the Zionist occupation against our Palestinian people. This assault is part of its escalation of its attacks, including mass arrests, settlement building, and the Judaization of Jerusalem.
Abu Rahma said that the occupation “did not stop its aggression against our Palestinian people for one day. This raises the question of how do we deal with aggression, and how do we repel the attacks and deter an aggressive, racist enemy? Can it be done through constant negotiations, or, instead, by forming a unified national front to resist the occupation?”
In response to the announced resignation of the negotiating team of Saeb Erekat and Mohammad Shtayyeh, Abu Rahma dismissed this news saying that it is a deceptive ploy for media consumption only. Abu Rahma said that PA President Abu Mazen bears responsibility for the return to negotiations in violation of the Palestinian consensus against doing so, and that it is time for a clear and explicit decision to end the negotiations and all forms of security cooperation with the occupation.
