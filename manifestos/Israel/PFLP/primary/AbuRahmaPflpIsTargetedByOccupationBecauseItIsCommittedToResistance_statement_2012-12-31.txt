[singlepic id=578 w=320 h=240 float=right]Comrade Emad Abu Rahma, of the Central Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, stated that the occupation forces continue to target members and supporters of the PFLP, and its offices and institutions, for arrest and persecution, for several reasons, primarily because the Front adheres to armed struggle and refuses to engage in the process of “negotiations” for a political settlement.
In an interview with Voice of the People radio station, Abu Rahma said, “the pace of the targeting rises and falls, but the targeting of the Popular Front is permanent,” noting the recent reports about the occupation forces’ arrest of an alleged cell of the Front, accusing them of planning to capture Israeli soldiers in order to exchange them for imprisoned PFLP General Secretary Ahmad Sa’adat, as stated by Israeli media based on comments by Israeli intelligence, the Shin Bet.
Abu Rahma also noted that there is indeed the potential to launch a third intifada, not only in the West Bank but also in Gaza, linking the continuing oppressive practices of the occupation which increase daily against our people, including settlement construction, massive land confiscation, the Judaization of Jerusalem, and the blockade and siege of Gaza, stating that Palestinian division is a challenge to popular mobilization.
