All Palestinians at the official and popular level must engage in the efforts to support the administrative detainees’ hunger strike in the Zionist occupation prisons, said Comrade Ahmed Abu Saud, former prisoner and member of the Central Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
In an interview with Al-Quds TV, Abu Saud said that “the administrative detainees’ strike is an important milestone in a fierce battle between the Palestinian prisoners and the occupation state…The battle of the administrative detainees is an important battle in a series of struggles by the prisoners to end the unjust policy of administrative detention used by the occupation to attempt to break the will of our people.”
“The Zionist occupation practices racism, fascism and brutality against striking prisoners and attempts to exploit their exhaustion and break their spirits through night raids and violent inspections around the clock,” said Abu Saud. He emphasized the importance of all forms of resistance in combatting the Zionist occupation in order to build pressure on the occupation state to force it to respond quickly to the prisoners’ demands. He warned against attempts to undermine the prisoners’ strike and urged the broadest support for the steadfastness of the heroic prisoners. He also emphasized the seriousness of the health status of the strikers, in particular as they face retaliation and isolation by the prison administration.
“The administrative detainees were forced to engage in an open hunger strike due to the intransigence of the occupation authorities and their insistence in committing crimes against the prisoners and refusing to respond to their demands,” said Abu Saud, saying that their demand is political in nature, ending the use of administrative detention, detention without charge or trial.
