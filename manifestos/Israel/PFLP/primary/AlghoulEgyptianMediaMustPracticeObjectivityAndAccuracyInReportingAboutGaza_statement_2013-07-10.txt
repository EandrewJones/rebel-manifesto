Comrade Kayed al-Ghoul, member of the Central Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, called on Egyptian media outlets to practice objectivity in reporting events related to Gaza.
“It is unfair that hurts Egyptian media speaks of the Palestinian people in this way, spreading rumours and suspicion,” said al-Ghoul, calling on the Egyptian people to “fully investigate the accuracy and objectivity of news related to Gaza, in particular contradictory reports which attempt to blame the Hamas movement for the problems of Egypt, without evidence.” Al-Ghoul also noted that such unfounded reporting tends to group all Palestinians together and target Palestinians as a group as “security threats,” posing a real threat to Palestinians’ ability to live, move, work and study.
On the Palestinian front, al-Ghoul said that the Palestinian people can draw lessons from the Egyptian experience that no one can dominate the national discussion, especially as we are in a stage of national liberation. He added that all Palestinian forces must uphold the supreme national interest and not narrow partisan interests. The will of the people to preserve unity, end division and rebuild Palestinian institutions to serve the national liberation movement must be paramount, he said.
