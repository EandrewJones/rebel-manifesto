“The Zionist attack is continuing on the international boycott movement, known as the BDS movement, in the context of the disarray and failure of the occupation state in dealing with the breadth and spread of this movement internationally, particularly in European and US universities, trade unions and other institutions,” said Comrade Khaled Barakat in an interview with the PFLP website on recent attacks on the BDS movement.
“Laws that are being passed and state actions taken in countries such as France, Canada and the United States in attempts to criminalize or formally stigmatize the boycott movement are an attempt to suppress the growth in the boycott movement which has been identified by the Israeli state and the Zionist movement as a significant threat,” said Barakat.
The Israeli government has imposed a de facto travel ban on Palestinian activist Omar Barghouti, one of the most prominent spokespeple for the BDS movement and a co-founder of the Palestinian campaign for the academic and cultural boycott of Israel.
Barakat spoke on Saturday, May 14 in Marseille, France, in an event organized by GUPS Aix-Marseille and Generation Palestine Marseille on the anniversary of the Nakba and Palestinian activism, including building the boycott campaign and confronting repression in France.
