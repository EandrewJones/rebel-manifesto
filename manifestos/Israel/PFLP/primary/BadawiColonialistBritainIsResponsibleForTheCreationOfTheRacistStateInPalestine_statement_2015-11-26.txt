Badawi spoke as part of discussions with various progressive and leftist organizations in panels and lectures marking the 98th anniversary of the infamous Balfour Declaration, discussing the history of the Zionist movement and the role of colonialist Britain in establishing the settler colonial racist entity “Israel” on the dispossession and destruction of the Palestinian Arab people.
The Zionist entity in occupied Palestine is a racist settler-colonial project of European origin. The infamous Balfour Declaration was a colonialist gift to the racist Zionist movement and an establishment of an imperial alliance; the aim of the establishment of “Israel” in the region was as a watchdog for the interests of imperialism in our region, in the heart of the Arab world, said Badawi.
Badawi said that the Palestinian people have been engaged in a harsh and constant battle for a century, confronting imperialism, Zionism and their agents in the region, noting the historical role of Palestinian refugees since 1948, the core of the Palestinian revolution and the establishment of the Palestine Liberation Organization. He emphasized that there is no “solution” except the achievement of the return of Palestinians to their land and homes from which they were displaced, the restoration of all stolen land and the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination over the entire land of Palestine.
Zionist forces destroyed more than 531 Palestinian villages in 1948, uprooted the Palestinian people from their homeland, and engaged in organized terror, committing dozens of massacres like that at Deir Yassin, and have pursued Palestinian refugees with massacres until the present day, recalling the massacres at Sabra and Shatila in Lebanon, to the massacres in the Gaza Strip in 2014, where the population are 90% Palestinian refugees, Badawi said.
The Israeli state has not only stolen land and expelled the people, said Badawi, but has also erected prisons, detention centers and the wall of annexation, continuing the theft of land and the organized terror carried out by settler colonists in the West Bank daily against the Palestinian people. Soldiers and settlers steal the land, uproot the trees, burn children, displace villages and attack Palestinian families, people, heritage and holy sites, he noted.
The historical and just solution to the conflict with Zionism cannot come about through a political settlement of the nature of the Oslo agreement, or the establishment of a so-called state of enclaves and cantons, but through the implementation of Palestinian return and the establishment of a democratic, secular state of Palestine on the entire land of Palestine, and the dismantlement of the racist Zionist project in Palestine and in the region, said Badawi, expressing the position of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
Further, Badawi noted that humanity is living in the world today according to the laws made by the International Monetary Fund, multinational corporations and imperialist countries that suppress capabilities and steal the products and resources of the people and the earth. The struggle to realize true democracy and socialism will continue, said Badawi, as this alone represents a viable alternative to the current situation; socialism is the only guarantee to achieve social justice, equality and peace in the world.
