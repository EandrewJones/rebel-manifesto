In response to the speech of Mahmoud Abbas on October 14, Comrade Khaled Barakat said that he “evaded all of the key points that the Palestinian people expect today amid the escalation of the popular uprising, in particular putting a final and complete end to the failed era of Oslo and negotiations, and announcing his commitment to our full national rights, and the launch of a new phase of internal relations to restore national unity and determine the date and place for an urgent meeting of the provisional leadership framework of the PLO, including all Palestinian national and Islamic forces.”
Barakat said, in a statement to Al-Hadaf News, that Abbas’s speech contained “some phrases which are superficially well-positioned in some aspects, such as referring to a refusal to remain hostage to agreements with Israel; but his reality is mired in contradiction to these phrases. Abbas continues to rely on the option and approach of the absurd negotiations, which have proved troublesome, dangerous and a complete failure over the past years and decades.”
“It would have been possible for Abbas to take this speech as an opportunity to compensate for the deficiencies which characterized his recent speech at the United Nations; however, this did not happen. Once again, it was a lackluster speech, returning over and over again to an obsolete political framework,” said Barakat.
“That which defines the meaning and goal of any such speech is the interest of the Palestinian Authority, and not, unfortunately, the higher interests of the Palestinian people or the principled positions held on a unified, national basis by the Palestinian people everywhere all over the world, in diaspora and in all of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1948,” said Barakat.
He emphasized the position of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, urging the formation of a unified national leadership for the uprising and ending the multiplicity of Palestinian Authorities, and to take the intifada and the resistance as the strategic choice and path for the Palestinian people, ” and not merely a bargaining chip to improve one’s position in negotiations with the enemy.”
