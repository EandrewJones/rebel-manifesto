“Saudi Arabia has confiscated the legitimate role of Egypt. If the latter seeks to assume its responsibility and national role towards the Palestinian people, especially as a leading force, the way to do so is by breaking the siege on our people in the Gaza Strip, and not through the promotion of the French initiative,” said Barakat.
The United States is the master and decision-maker for both Israel and Saudi Arabia, said Barakat, adding that “the accelerated pace of enhancing GCC-Israeli relations comes in the context of the division and fragmentation of the region at the expense of the independence and resources of the Arab nation, especially on the cause of Palestine.”
“You can always find the U.S. in any such initiative, whether it is labelled French or Egyptian or Saudi,” said Barakat. “These initiatives are aimed at ending the resistance and misleading the people who refuse to be tricked by the so-called ‘peace process’ in the region.”
“The Arab initiative is another face of the French initiative; it is modified for the benefit of the Zionist entity, part of a massive attempt being pushed in this time to liquidate the right of return and wrest new concessions from the Palestinian people,” said Barakat, saying that these initiatives attempt to create an “Oslo 2.”
