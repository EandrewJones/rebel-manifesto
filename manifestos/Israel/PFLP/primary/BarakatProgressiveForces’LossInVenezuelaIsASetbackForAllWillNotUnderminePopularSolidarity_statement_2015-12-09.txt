Responding to the electoral loss for the progressive forces in Venezuela’s December 6 elections, Comrade Khaled Barakat said that “this is a sad day in the life of the popular classes and indigenous people, not only in Venezuela but across the continent of Latin America, who have reaped the fruits of the Bolivarian revolution in health services, housing, education, jobs, social welfare, programs for youth and women, and more.”
“This loss may lead to negative effects on the formal and official solidarity of the Venezuelan state with the Palestinian cause, but we know that there will be no such setback on the popular and grass-roots level,” said Barakat. “The popular and mutual solidarity between the Venezuelan and Palestinian people will remain strong and steadfast. We know that this election is not the end of the Bolivarian revolution, but a difficult period, and that the forces of progress and revolution will return to the forefront and to victory.”
