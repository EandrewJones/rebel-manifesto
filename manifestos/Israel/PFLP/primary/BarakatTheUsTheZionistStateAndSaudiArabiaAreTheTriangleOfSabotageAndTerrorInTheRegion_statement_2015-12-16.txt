“The Palestinian people have been struggling for decades against imperialist, Zionist and reactionary terror in Palestine, and have paid a dear price in this struggle as a victim of colonial occupation,” said Comrade Khaled Barakat, responding to media reports of the decision of the Palestinian Authority to participate in the so-called “Islamic Coalition Against Terror” led by Saudi Arabia.
“This is an absurd decision that represents only those who have taken it and does not represent the Palestinian people. The Palestinian Authority is standing in one valley and the Palestinian people are standing in quite another,” Barakat said. “Terror in our region has been imposed by the criminal actions of the enemy camp with all of its arms: imperialism, Zionism and reactionary regimes. This is the lived experience of our nation from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf,” said Barakat.
The masses of the Palestinian people are aware of the U.S., Zionist and Saudi role in Yemen, Syria, Iraq and the region as a whole, and that these parties have no legitimacy to talk about “opposing terror” while imposing terror upon the Palestinian and Arab people, Barakat said.
