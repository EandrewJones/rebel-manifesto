Comrade Khalida Jarrar, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, announced in a live interview on Quds TV on Sunday evening, 12 March, that the Front will not participate in upcoming municipal elections in the West Bank of occupied Palestine, in light of the Palestinian Authorityâ€™s continued security coordination with the Israeli occupation and violent attack on demonstrators protesting for the martyr Basil al-Araj.
She announced that the PFLP had decided today to suspend its participation in the elections after the attack on the marchers, including the father of Basil al-Araj. Jarrar demanded that those responsible for the suppression of the march and beating of demonstrators must be held accountable and security coordination brought to an end. She noted that if no action is taken on these key issues, the Front will announce further positions and take additional actions.
