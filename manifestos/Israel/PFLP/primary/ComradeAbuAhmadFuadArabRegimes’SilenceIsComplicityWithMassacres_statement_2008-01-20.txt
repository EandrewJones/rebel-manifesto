Comrade Abu Ahmad Fuad, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, in an interview with the Al-Alam satellite channel on Sunday, January 20, 2008, condemned the complicit silence of Arab regimes concerning the Israeli massacres in Gaza. He condemned Arab governments for the lavish welcome and luxurious gifts presented to U.S. President George Bush during his visit to the region while failing to provide any kind of opposition, even mere criticism, towards Bush and his agenda. He further condemned the signing of various economic and military cooperation agreements with Bush and with French Prime Minister Sarkozy, while the Zionist crimes in Palestine are mounting. These agreements come as a form of reward to Bush for his destruction of Iraq, while Bush adopts the Zionist position; such agreements have the effect of indirectly adopting the Zionist position as well, he said.
The crimes of the occupation in Palestine are happening under full cover of the American administration and the Western powers, and these massacres continue despite the Palestinian Authority leadershipâ€™s repeatedly expressed position of willingness to continue the futile negotiations with the occupiers, he said. He described the recent events as a part of the ongoing circle of massacres carried out by Israel against our people in Palestine and in exile, having received a green light from George W. Bush for escalation.
Comrade Fuad also stated that the Palestinian blood being shed by the occupier in the West Bank and Gaza should inspire Fateh and Hamas to return to the table of national dialogue and set aside differences in order to unify the resistance in the face of this escalation and confront the massacres and crimes against our people.
