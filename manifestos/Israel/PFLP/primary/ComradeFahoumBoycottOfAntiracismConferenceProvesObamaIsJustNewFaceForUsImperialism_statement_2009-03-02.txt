Comrade Marwan Fahoum, “Abu Sami,” member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said on March 2, 2009 that the decision of the new U.S. administration to boycott the UN conference against racism in Geneva clearly reveals that the Obama administration is no different than previous administrations concerning Palestine.Comrade Fahoum said that this action underlines once more that Obama is nothing more than a new face for the same U.S. imperialism, and emphasizes the strategic partnership between U.S. imperialism and Zionism. He also noted that it emphasizes once again the utter futility of relying upon the United States to assist the Palestinian cause in any way.He stated that the U.S. position corresponds entirely with the Israeli position and that both stand against the world conference against racism in fear of the conference’s findings in condemnation of Zionism and the Zionist state as a living embodiment of racism and guilty of the crime of genocide against the Palestinian people. Furthermore, he noted that the U.S. position as well as the Canadian position boycotting this conference only emphasize that those countries are themselves settler-colonial states, built on genocide of indigenous people and massive racist exploitation from slavery to the present day.Comrade Fahoum stated that this position also seeks to silence the potential condemnation of Zionism as the equivalent of Nazi racism as happened at the earlier conference against racism held in Durban, South Africa in 2001, in which both the participating countries and the broad participation of social movements internationally and in South Africa clearly condemned Zionist racism and supported the Palestinian people’s struggle for return and liberation.
