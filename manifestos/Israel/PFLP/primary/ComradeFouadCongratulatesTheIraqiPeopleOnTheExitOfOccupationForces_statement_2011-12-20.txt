Comrade Abu Ahmad Fouad, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, congratulated the Iraqi people on the occasion of the exit of U.S. occupation forces from Iraq, praising the sacrifices and resistance of the Iraqi people, who lost hundreds of thousands of victims to the occupation to gain their freedom and independence.

Comrade Fouad expressed his confidence that the Iraqi people will successfully expel the last soldier or civilian foreign occupier, and with their resistance defeat the project of fragmentation and division imposed upon Iraq by the occupation. He expressed his firm hope that putting an end to the occupation will also mean putting an end to sectarianism and internal strife, which has only strengthened the occupier.
He expressed the wishes of the Popular Front for the Iraqi people – progress, self-determination, prosperity, and rejection of any agreements or treaties that undermine Iraq’s sovereignty or impose external control or domination over its wealth. Comrade Fouad noted that the Iraqi people have always supported the Palestinian people in resisting the occupation until the liberation of Palestine, and that the Front likewise supports the Iraqi people in their struggle against colonialism and imperialism.
