Dear brave comrades, the leadership and fighters of the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades,
I greet you personally, on behalf of my comrades in the Political Bureau and on behalf of all cadres and members of the Front, you who carry the guns of the struggler, who fire the rockets of resistance, who strike serious blows against the military of the enemy.
Dear comrades,
Our hearts are with you, our feelings and emotions are by your side in the battle of dignity, honor and pride, in order to achieve the goals of our people for freedom and a decent life in the steadfast, valiant Gaza Strip. We salute your steadfastness, your resistance on the road to victory and the achievement of the goals and demands of our people, a legitimate and rightful resistance. The enemy only understands the language of force and defeat. You have been tried by fire, on the path of resistance and martyrdom until victory, return and liberation of Palestine.
