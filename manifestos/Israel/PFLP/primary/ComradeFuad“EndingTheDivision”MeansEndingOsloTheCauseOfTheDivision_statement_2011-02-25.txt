Comrade Abu Ahmad Fuad, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said that there can be no national liberation movement without democratic and popular institutions that enable the people to decide their own destiny. In a meeting on February 24, 2011 with the website Ajras Al-Awda discussing calls from Palestinian youth for democratic political representation for the Palestinian people, he said that the Palestine Liberation Organization must be rebuilt on democratic and popular foundations, according to its original charter before any illegitimate amendments.
Further, Comrade Fuad said that it is true that the path of concessions and subordination received a big boost after the disastrous Camp David accord, but those committed to this path have remained locked in their political decisions even after the results of the catastrophic second Iraq war. It is clear that the Oslo agreement and the political leadership committed to it is directly responsible for Palestinian weakness and for today’s division, said Comrade Fuad. Furthermore, he said, discussion of “ending the division” means ending the reasons for the division; thus, terminating the Oslo accord and all that has followed from it and returning instead to mobilizing the Palestinian community everywhere it is present. He added that the Popular Front is aware that there are some who want to use the slogan “end the division,” but cover up the very real political reasons for the split, and ignore all of the calls and demands from the Palestinian people for change.
In conclusion, Comrade Fuad said that we are witnessing the era of the people’s rise from the ashes of tyranny and oppression. All political forces on the right path will join the people and curse those so-called leaders who believe that their own impunity and power is more important than the future of our nation in crisis, not only in the present but in all of history.
