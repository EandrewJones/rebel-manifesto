Comrade Khalida Jarrar, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, is facing an expulsion order to Jericho that has been imposed upon her by Zionist soldiers who invaded her home on August 20, with a military court order forcibly displacing her to Jericho within 24 hours.
Jarrar rejected the order and refused to sign it, stating that she would not comply with this illegal and illegitimate order, and instead said that “it is the occupation that must leave our homeland.” Palestinian youth and membrs of the General Union of Palestinian Women came to her home to sit in solidarity with her and in preparation to resist any attempt to remove Jarrar to Jericho.
Raising the profile of the struggle and rejecting the deportation policy, she has established a permanent protest tent in the courtyard of the Palestinian Legislative Council building in Ramallah, which has been visited by a number of international delegations, including a Basque delegation from Askapena and Swiss parliamentarians, as well as the Palestinian national and Islamic political forces and national figures. Comrades of the Front from across the area have come to the tent to stand with Comrade Jarrar and to reject the policy of deportation.
Palestinian, Arab and international campaigns in solidarity with Jarrar, demanding the immediate cancellation of the expulsion order, have been growing and expanding. A sit-in at the United Nations headquarters in Ramallah, calling on the UN to act against the unjust order, which violates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Conventions, will take place on Monday, August 25 at 1:00 PM.
