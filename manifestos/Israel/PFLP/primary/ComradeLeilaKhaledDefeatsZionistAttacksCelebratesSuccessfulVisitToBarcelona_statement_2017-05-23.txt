Comrade Leila Khaled, member of the Political Bureau and head of the PFLP’s Refugees and Right of Return Department, participated in the annual book fair in Barcelona, featuring the Catalan translation of her book.
She had an active program of meetings, including one with the Palestine Group in the Catalan parliament, and interviews with newspapers, television and radio. Her visit was widely covered, especially following an attempt by Zionist organizations to shut down Comrade Leila’s events and block her from traveling to Barcelona, even filing a complaint with the Public Prosecution, which was rejected.
At the end of the exhibition, a symposium was held which drew more than 800 people from the Catalan and Palestinian communities; the organizers set up two screens outside the hall for the overflow audience.
The discussion focused on the struggle of prisoners and the Palestinian resistance, in which Comrade Khaled emphasized that the uprising of the prisoners is opening the road for return and liberation, in which empty stomachs are the gateway to national unity. She also emphasized the importance of resistance in all forms, including and especially armed struggle, in the Palestinian struggle for return and liberation.
