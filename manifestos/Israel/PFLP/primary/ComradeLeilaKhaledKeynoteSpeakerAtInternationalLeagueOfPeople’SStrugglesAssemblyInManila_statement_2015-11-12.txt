Comrade Leila Khaled, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, began a visit to the Philippines on November 11 with an address at the International Women’s Assembly, a gathering bringing together women involved in liberation movements around the world. Khaled’s visit to the Philippines comes in the context of the Fifth International Assembly of the International League of People’s Struggles, which includes numerous mass organizations, popular organizations, unions and social movements around the world, especially from Asia and Southeast Asia.
Comrade Leila Khaled will participate in a series of events and lectures organized by ILPS and associated organizations, as well as the GABRIELA women’s organization in the Philippines and the International Women’s Assembly. She will deliver a keynote speech at the Fifth International Assembly of ILPS.
In her speech to the IWA, Khaled called for strengthening the alliance of peoples’ movements and revolutionary forces of democracy and national liberation around the world, who are engaged in daily, fierce battles confronting imperialism, Zionism, racism and national and class oppression. Emphasizing the role of women in liberation movements in Palestine around the world, she discussed the Palestinian movement and called for escalating the breadth and comprehensiveness of the international boycott of Israel, through economic, cultural, academic and all forms of boycott, and ending all political relations with the racist occupation state on the road to the isolation and defeat of the Zionist project in occupied Palestine.
She urged support for the rising intifada in Palestine, and the central role of the struggle of Palestinian prisoners, led by Comrade Ahmad Sa’adat, the imprisoned General Secretary of the PFLP. Khaled called for greater exposure of the daily crimes committed by the occupation state against the Palestinian people – siege, assassinations, mass arrests, particularly targeting hundreds of Palestinian children and youth.
She further emphasized the centrality of the right of return of Palestinian refugees for the liberation of Palestine, and the need to dismantle the Zionist project in Palestine and establish justice, democracy and equality on the land of Palestine.
