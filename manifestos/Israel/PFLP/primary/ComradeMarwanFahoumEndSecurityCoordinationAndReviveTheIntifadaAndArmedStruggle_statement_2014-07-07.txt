Comrade Marwan (Abu Sami) Fahoum, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, denounced the “heinous crime by a horde of Zionist settlers who burned alive the child martyr, Mohammed Abu Khdeir. They have already followed this horrific crime with bloody and barbaric attacks by the forces of the enemy, terror, intimidation, vandalism and arrests attacking hundreds of our people. There have been thousands of such crimes over two-thirds of a century, which reveals the fundamentally racist nature of Zionism and the persistence of racism in the Zionist entity, and in the hearts of Zionists, and in particular, the hatred against the Palestinian people and the Arab nation. This reaffirms the futility of relying and even considering the possibility of reforming the Zionist enemy of its repressive policies, methods and bloody crimes against our people, our nation and our cause.”
Comrade Abu Sami noted that the first step in building a unified national front to confron tthe occupier is “the need to end security coordination with the Zionist enemy as the most serious issue of the day threatening the struggles of our people in occupied Palestine,” and tht the second step is “to end negotiations with the Zionist enemy which for now over two decades have brought years of drought for our people and benefited only the Zionist enemy…”
Abu Sami emphasized the need to convert “the rising popular movement in the occupied homeland into an overall popular Intifada against the occupation and its settler hordes,” emphasizing the need to restore all of the Palestinian factions’ role in struggle, noting the role of “the armed resistance as the most effective form to drain the enemy’s resources and to respond to the crimes of the occupation.” He noted that every attack by the enemy should be met with an equal or greater response.
“The suffering of our people is the result of the ominous Oslo agreement. The rising of our people confirms their ability and that of their resistance to overcome all of the difficult circumstances and conditions, to escalate the resistance in all its forms and create a renewed climate of political movement, preventing the Palestinian cause from being held hostage at the table of negotiations and raising it once more to the highest levels of the international arena and the United Nations,” said Abu Sami.
