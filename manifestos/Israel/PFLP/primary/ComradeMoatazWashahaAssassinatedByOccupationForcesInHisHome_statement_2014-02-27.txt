The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestne and its military wing, the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades and the Palestinian people, salute and mourn the martyred struggler, Comrade Moataz Washaha, 25, who was murdered by Zionist occupation forces in his home in Bir Zeit village in the early morning of Thursday, February 27.
His home was surrounded from the early morning hours, occupation special forces attacked his home and demanded he surrender to them for being a member of the PFLP. He refused to turn himself into the occupation forces, and they bombed his house with shells, machine guns and projectiles, killing him and destroying a portion of his home in what was clearly a targeted assassination.
The PFLP calls upon all to participate in his funeral procession on Friday as befits a true fighter for the people. The martyr Comrade Washaha joined the ranks of the PFLP as a boy, was arrested and jailed more than once at the hands of the occupation forces.
The PFLP and the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades pledge to the martyr and all the martyrs that their blood will not be shed in vain, that their response will come, and that the resistance will continue until the occupation is defeated on the entire land of Palestine. The Front further demanded that the Palestinian Authority end the devastating and unacceptable security coordination with the occupation in all of its forms and instead support the continuation of resistance and struggle together with our people.
