Speaking at the Jerusalem Day rally in Gaza City on August 17, 2012, Comrade Rabah Muhanna, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, emphasized that Jerusalem is and will remain Arab and the eternal capital of Palestine.
He gave the keynote speech at the rally on behalf of the National and Islamic Forces, saying that “we are committed to the right of return and to liberation of prisoners and resistance against the occupation as long as it is on our land. Jerusalem is not going to be restored by absurd negotiations.”
Muhanna continued, “The most effective way to restore our rights, the city of Jerusalem and all of Palestine is constant struggle and resistance in all of its forms, popular, armed, cultural and economic…We will not recognize Israel and we will continue resistance and steadfastness until we achieve our full rights, and we will not compromise them,”
He called for the Palestine Liberation Organization to halt the absurd and harmful negotiations that have been proven on so many occasions to be detrimental to Palestinian national interest and the interests of our people. He also emphasized the need to end internal division, calling upon Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, in exile and diaspora and in occupied Palestine ’48 to mobilize and demand an end to the disastrous division, saying that we must focus on the battle with the enemy in order to struggle for freedom, independence, and the liberation of all of Palestine.
He also called upon the governments in Ramallah and Gaza to stop the violations of Palestinians’ democratic freedom, saying that all Palestinian forces must be supported in their freedom to participate in the struggle for liberation and self-determination, emphasizing that the Ramallah Palestinian Authority must immediately end the crime of ‘security coordination’ with the Zionist occupation.
In conclusion, Comrade Muhanna saluted our people on the occasion of Eid al-Fitr. Thousands of Palestinians from the various political organizations participated in the rally in Gaza City, which began at Palestine Mosque and marched through the city in a united rally carrying Palestinian flags.
