Comrade Dr. Rabah Muhanna warned of the dangers of a deal between Hamas and the occupation for a so-called “long-term truce” in exchange for a loosening of the siege on Gaza. Muhanna, a member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, spoke following media reports of a second meeting between Khaled Meshaal, leader of Hamas, with Tony Blair, discussing such a potential agreement.
“We know how much people in the Gaza Strip are suffering due to the siege, under severely difficult economic and social conditions. This may cause some in the Strip to support such a move…but this topic has a severe and negative impact on the Palestinian cause and damaging repercussions for our people,” said Muhanna. He spoke of the need to draw lessons from the 20 years of bitter experience of Oslo and its disastrous results, from which our people have reaped no benefits despite wide support for Oslo at the beginning.
“The Front will always ‘bang on the walls of the tank,'” said Muhanna, alluding to a passage in Palestinian writer and PFLP leader Ghassan Kanafani’s work “Men in the Sun.” “We will stand against any agreement that does not benefit our people, the cause and the liberation of Palestine, and our weapons are always pointed at the Zionist enemy,” said Muhanna.
