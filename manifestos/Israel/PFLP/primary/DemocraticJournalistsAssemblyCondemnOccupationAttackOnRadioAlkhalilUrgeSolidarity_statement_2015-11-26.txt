The Democratic Journalists’ Assembly condemned the “Israeli” occupation forces’ raid on the “Radio Al-Khalil” station headquarters in occupied Al-Khalil on Saturday, seizing broadcasting and recording equipment, noting that this is an illegitimate and criminal attack on Palestinian journalists and media.
The Assembly called upon human rights organizations, unions and Arab and international media associations to act quickly to stop these attacks and thefts by the occupation state and to protect journalists against the repeated attacks of the occupier, noting that there has been a prevailing international silence about the racist attacks on Palestinian journalists.
The assembly also called upon all Palestinian journalists’ syndicates and media institutions to work together to organize a unified radio broadcast in solidarity with the closed stations, in order to uphold the voice of truth and support the popular intifada, confronting the escalating attacks of the occupier.
