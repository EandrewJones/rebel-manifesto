The Democratic Journalists Assembly denounced the extension of the administrative detention of fellow journalist Omar Nazzal for the second time in a row as part of the attack on Palestinian journalists by the Zionist occupation. The Assembly said that this administrative detention renewal is one more crime to be added to the series of attacks on Palestinian journalists in an attempt to silence the voice of truth.
The Assembly reiterated its condemnation of the ongoing imprisonment of Nazzal, who had been scheduled for released on Tuesday, November 22 after the expiration of his imprisonment without trial. Further, it urged all international organizations and journalists’ syndicates to take action to urge the immediate release of Nazzal and fellow imprisoned Palestinian journalists.
Omar Nazzal was imprisoned on April 23 as he attempted to leave occupied Palestine at the Karameh crossing to participate in an international conference of the European Journalists’ Federation in Bosnia and Herzegovnia, and ordered to administrative detention without charge or trial.
