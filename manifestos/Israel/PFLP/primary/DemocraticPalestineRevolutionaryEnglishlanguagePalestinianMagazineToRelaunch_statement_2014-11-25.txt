Democratic Palestine is a revolutionary Palestinian magazine in the English language dedicated to the struggle for liberation and return, published bi-monthly by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. With the 47th anniversary of the PFLP, the Front is re-launching its English-language publication, which has been a consistent source of information, mutual revolutionary dialogue and discussion regarding the Palestinian struggle for return and liberation, and regarding the revolutionary movements of the world, for decades.
Democratic Palestine was previously published from 1984 through 1993, as the successor publication to the earlier English-language publication, the PFLP Bulletin.
Democratic Palestine is a space for engagement with broad progressive forces around the world, and development of relation of mutual solidarity that will strengthen and support the struggle for a democratic and liberated Palestine, in the context of a global struggle against imperialism, Zionism and their allies. It is committed to strengthening a revolutionary internationalist discourse around the Palestinian liberation movement and examining the struggle in its international, Arab and Palestinian context.

Submissions may be made for publication under your name, under a pseudonym or through a pseudonymous/anonymous email, or without a byline.

Democratic Palestine is published with the following aims:
– conveying the political line of the PFLP and other progressive Palestinian and Arab forces
– providing current information and analysis pertinent to the Palestinian liberation struggle, as well as developments on the Arab and international levels
– serving as a forum for building relations of mutual solidarity between the Palestinian revolution and progressive organizations, parties, national liberation movements and countries around the world.
We look forward to working to reinvigorate the international revolutionary exchange of ideas in the struggle for Palestine and the struggle for liberation, for socialism, and for justice everywhere in the world.
