The Democratic Progressive Student Pole at Bir Zeit University near Ramallah expressed its solidarity with the Shabiba, the Fateh Youth Movement at the University. Its membership and Facebook page was frozen by the Fateh leadership following a statement by the Fateh Youth after it issued a statement demanding the ouster of PA president Mahmoud Abbas after he participated in the funeral of Zionist war criminal Shimon Peres.
The Democratic Progressive Student Pole issued a press statement:
“‘Our worst fear is that treason becomes another opinion.’
So wrote our brothers and comrades in the Shabibah, Fateh student youth movement statement, and so we begin. They wrote their position which we consider today to be the position of all of the national movement and the position of the student movement at Bir Zeit. We reject the farce of peace and normalization against our people, and we announce in all sincerity and in the spirit of national unity, the spirit of Abu Ammar and Abu Ali Mustafa, that we will be in the same trench of struggle against any attacks on our beloved fellow youth, and we recall the words of Yasser Arafat, Abu Ammar, ‘I rely on these people, I rely on these young people.'”
