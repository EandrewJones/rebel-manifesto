A reception was held in the Lebanese Press Syndicate in Beirut on December 23, marking the 47th anniversary of the Front’s founding, where Comrade Abu Ahmad Fouad, Deputy General Secretary of the PFLP, spoke to an audience of PFLP leaders, cadres and members, representatives of Palestinian and Lebanese political forces, and supporters.
Comrade Abu Ahmad Fouad recalled the history of the PFLP, its origins in the Arab Nationalist Movement, and its clear vision since its founding that all of Palestine is part of the Arab nation and that the Palestinian and Arab people must liberate all of Palestine through struggle, primarily armed struggle and the protracted people’s liberation war. He noted the importance of Palestinian national unity to achieve victory, noting also that the Palestinian revolution stands at the heart of the Arab and international liberation movements. The Front at its founding identified the camp of friends of the revolution and the camp of enemies – and the Front remains committed to the principles on which it was founded, noted Fouad.
He reiterated the Front’s categorical rejection of the project of the Palestinian Authority and the “French initiative” to submit a draft resolution to the UN Security Council, noting that this draft violates the Palestinian national constants and is actually an attempt to resume the absurd and dangerous negotiations and to undermine Palestinian national rights. “We reject this project. Any potential draft to be submitted to international institutions, including the General Assembly and the Security Council, must be reviewed fully and supported by all of the Palestinian factions and mass institutions without exception. The Zionist entity, the Arab regimes and the United States are working together to attempt to liquidate the Palestinian cause amid the circumstances of crisis prevailing in the region and the Arab world. We refuse to accept these projects. Instead, we must be demanding that the United Nations apply its existing resolutions,” said Fouad.
He urged an immediate end to the security coordination of the Palestinian Authority with the Zionist occupier. It is deeply damaging to the Palestinian people and cause. “Palestinian security services should have the role of protecting our people throughout Palestine, not working with the occupier,” he said.
He denounced any attempts by reactionary armed groups to enter the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, noting that this is an attempt to damage Palestinian interests and the Palestinian cause, and reiterated the complete rejection of such groups by the Palestinian resistance forces. Further, he called upon the Lebanese state to remove the obstacles, discrimination, infringements of rights and injustices that Palestinian refugees face inside Lebanon, saying that Palestinian refugees have the right to live decent lives on the road to return to Palestine. “We will return, whether sooner or later, we will return to Palestine,” said Fouad.
