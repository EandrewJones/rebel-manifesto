Comrade Abu Ahmad Fouad, Deputy General Secretary of the PFLP, said that “all of the enemy’s attempts to divide the Palestinian people and shatter its national goals, and its repeated attempts to isolate our people in Jerusalem or in the occupied homeland of 1948 from the rest of our people, in the West Bank, in Gaza, and in the countries of the diaspora, were mere illusions that have shattered on the rock of the unity of the people, their steadfastness, and their right to their homeland of Palestine, all of Palestine. Our great people in all of historic Palestine, and in all countries of exile and diaspora, are one people unfied in blood, determination, territorial integrity, and goals.”
He saluted the Palestinian people and political forces in Yafa, Haifa, Akka, Nazareth, Umm al-Fahm, Jerusalem, and every location in Palestine, all of Palestine. “What is required now is a unified leadership of the uprising, Popular Committees in cities, villages and refugee camps, and mutual support committees to support the prisoners and create mechanisms to provide for the needs of the masses,” said Fuad.
Furthermore, he urged immediate action by the Palestinian official leadership to go to international institutions and in particular to accede to the International Criminal Court and demand that the Zionists be put on trial for their war crimes against our people.
“The situation requires the formation of a unified military operations room in Gaza, perpetuating the launch of rockets and missiles against targets in order to strike significant blows,” he said.
