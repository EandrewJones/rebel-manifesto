The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine called upon the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, meeting January 30 in Ramallah, to re-evaluate the so-called “exploratory meetings” in Amman under the auspices of the Quartet, and announce once and for all the ultimate failure of negotiations. Such negotiations have continued for over twenty years and consistently failed to produce any national solution that preserves even a minimum of rights guaranteed by international law – of freedom, independence and return.
The Front also called upon the Executive Committee to officially declare that the Quartet has utterly failed to carry forward its duties and responsibilities to require the occupation to implement international law and United Nations resolutions, and to respect international humanitarian and human rights law, and to reject any further role for the Quartet as an illegitimate diversion from the need to implement international law and Palestinian human rights via legitimate international bodies such as the United Nations.
The Front warned Palestinian officials against caving to international pressure and maneuvers and participating in any further negotiations. Such negotiations are employed by the occupation to provide cover for its unprecedented settlement expansion, massive looting of land and water, ongoing displacement and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, and the Judaization of Jerusalem, and threaten Palestinian national rights and unity. The Front also stated that the Palestinian people reject these negotiations under U.S. auspices and that any continuation of such negotiations under any name comes at the expense of the national cause and the land and people of Palestine, serving only the interests of the occupation and its allies. Such negotiations, said the PFLP, are also used by Arab and international parties to escape their responsibilities.
The Front demanded that the Executive Committee display the political will and willingness to take responsibility to end any such negotiations and stop the deterioration of the national political and social struggle, and work instead to build unity to struggle for and achieve Palestinian national rights to self-determination, freedom and return.
