Comrade Abu Ahmad Fuad, member of the political bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, denounced the visit of Egypt’s Mufti, Sheikh Ali Gomaa, to occupied Jerusalem as a harmful and dangerous step towards normalization that threatens the central issue of the Arab and Muslim nation, and a blow to the brother Egyptian people, their martyrs, and the Egyptian revolution.
Comrade Fuad said that this action reflects negatively on the Palestinian people’s struggle for rights, saying that this visit abuses the feelings of the Arab nation toward Jerusalem. He called upon Egyptian revolutionary and popular forces to act to put an end to such practices and develop laws to prevent normalization of any kind in Egypt, saying that this act is in no way commensurate to the qualitative change that has taken place in Egypt.
