Palestine is ready to stage a third uprising, or intifada, against the Israeli occupation, said Comrade Abu Ahmad Fuad, Deputy General Secretary of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, in Moscow on Friday, March 20.
“A third intifada will certainly happen. The Palestinian people are ready for such an uprising…Most of the forces’ leaders think that we must exercise armed resistance within our capabilities,” Abu Ahmad Fouad, of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said during a media conference held at the Rossiya Segodnya International Information Agency.
Fuad spoke while visiting Russia, where he met with Russian deputy foreign minister Mikhail Bogdanov along with Comrade Maher al-Taher, member of the Political Bureau of the PFLP. In the meeting, the Front delegation emphasized that the so-called “peace process” is only a US-Zionist ploy aimed at buying time to expand settlements and cement control over the entire land of Palestine. “The Israeli election results make it clear that the Zionist state is moving only towards ever more extremism and racism,” said Fuad.
Bogdanov expressed his support and the support of Russia for the Palestinian people’s struggle for their national rights, saying that Russia will support internal Palestinian dialogue for national unity and take a clear position in defense of Palestinian rights to freedom and self-determination in international bodies and mechanisms.
The Front delegation is also scheduled to meet with Vitaly Naumkin, director of the Institute of Oriental Studies in Moscow, as well as a number of Russian political forces.
