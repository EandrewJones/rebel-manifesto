Comrade Abu Ahmad Fuad, Deputy General Secretary of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, issued a press statement on November 4, including the following points:
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine expresses its full readiness to convene a meeting of representatives of all of the factions of the Palestinian resistance without exception in Beirut during the next two weeks to discuss how to develop and escalate the intifada, and how to form a unified national leadership to manage the affairs and activities of the Palestinian intifada in every location, provide for the requirements of the uprising and its political protection, and care for the families of the martyrs, including compensation for those whose homes are destroyed. The PFLP also calls to discuss how to follow up to hold the occupier accountable for its crimes in international forums, particularly through international trials, and how to mobilize all the energies of our people in the intifada.
These are the main topics of the meeting to be held at this table; the door remains open to add any further points, if the parties and factions participating agree.

Deputy General Secretary of the PFLP
