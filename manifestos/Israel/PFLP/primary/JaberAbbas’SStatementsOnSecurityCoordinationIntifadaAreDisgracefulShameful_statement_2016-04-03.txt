Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas’s statements to Israeli TV about the intifada are “disgraceful, very painful” and shameful, said Comrade Badran Jaber, a leader in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, adding that Abbas’s path of negotiations and security coordination has proven to be “a complete failure” and a disaster for the Palestinian people.
Jaber denounced Abbas’s statements denouncing the intifada and praising security cooperation with the occupation, saying that they are completely at odds with the sentiment and action of the Palestinian people. “The Palestinian people want to struggle for their national interests, the interests of the Palestinian and Arab people, and their liberation….they are struggling by all means to be free of occupation, which desecrates the land, tramples on the dignity of the people, and defiles the sacred places, with complete impunity.”
Jaber pointed to the occupation’s escalating crimes against the Palestinian people, including land confiscation, home demolitions, and extrajudicial executions, noting that occupation officials openly advertise their desire to expel and kill Palestinians and intensify their attacks on Palestinians in occupied Palestine 1948. In this context, Jaber denounced the utter disconnect from reality evidenced by the PA run by Abbas, who claimed that he is “not ashamed of security coordination” and that “everyone should respect him for this.”
Jaber demanded that all Palestinian officials support the intifada as an absolute duty, rather than seeking to undermine it through security programs, inspections, surveillance and security coordination with the occupier which daily imprisons and kills Palestinians. He denounced the PA’s refusal to implement the decisions of the Palestinian Central Council in March 2015 to end security coordination, saying that “Our position is clear and explicit. We stand against all such policies adopted by the Authority in Ramallah, which repeatedly rejects the Palestinian consensus and the binding agreements and decisions of the Palestinian institutions.”
