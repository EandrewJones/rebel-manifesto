Comrade Badran Jaber, a leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, saluted the memory of the martyr and leader, comrade Wadih Haddad, on the anniversary of his death on March 28, 1978.
Comrade Jaber noted that Wadih Haddad had been committed to the Palestinian cause from an early age, when he left school and returned home in 1947 to engage in the struggle to confront the Zionist invasion, later being one of the co-founders of the Arab Nationalist Movement and the Popular Front, continuing to resist until his death.
Jaber said in an interview on Voice of the People radio that Wadih Haddad was one of the most prominent Palestinian militants, alongside his comrade al-Hakim, Dr. George Habash, always sincerely committed to the nation, the cause and the Front. He saluted Haddad for traveling the world to capture information, or to deal a blow against the enemy, saying that he obtained information from various sources, particularly Western sources, to serve the Palestinian struggle, including secret information about the Shin Bet and Mossad, the Zionist security services.
Jaber pointed out that Haddad was bold and able to inflict damage to the Israeli occupation in unexpected ways and across the world, following the motto, after the enemy everywhere. He was considered the “most dangerous man in the world” due to his many successes, in particular the initial hijackings of aircraft that drew the world’s attention to the Palestinian cause.
