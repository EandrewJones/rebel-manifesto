The new Zionist Knesset bill annexing the Jordan Valley indicates once more that the occupation state will never allow any form of Palestinian state with full sovereignty, said Comrade Khalida Jarrar, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
It is critical to promote the international campaign to boycott the occupation state at all levels, said Jarrar, stressing the need to halt security coordination, fully activate the resistance in all its forms, end the persecution of resistance forces, and build on international solidarity at popular and official levels, in order to confront the ongoing attack on Palestinian existece.
The occupation continually imposes new facts on the ground, including the massive construction of settlements, said Jarrar, noting that the Palestinian Jordan Valley is a closed zone to Palestinians. Palestinian farmers from the Jordan Valley cannot enter their own land without a special permit from the occupation state, said Jarrar.
In an interview with Voice of the People (Sawt al-Shaab) radio station, Jarrar said that there is clearly no option in the struggle for self-determination and freedom for Palestinians but struggle and sacrifices; the futile negotiations with the Zionist entity carried out by the Palestinian Authority leadership and the PLO will lead nowhere but to greater losses for Palestinians.
Jarrar called for an immediate end to the negotiations and to develop a collective and comprehensive plan of struggle and confrontation, including political struggle at the level of international institutions â€“ in particular, the International Criminal Court. She urged the international prosecution of the officials of the Zionist state for the crimes they commit against the Palestinian people, saying that this is an international political option that is a clear alternative to the futile and dangerous negotiations.
