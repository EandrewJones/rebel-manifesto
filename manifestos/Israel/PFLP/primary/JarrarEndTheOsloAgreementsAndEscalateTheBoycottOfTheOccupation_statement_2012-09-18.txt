Comrade Khalida Jarrar, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said on September 18, 2012 that it is past time to end reliance on all forms of bilateral negotiations and to end the reliance on the agreements and ‘peace process’ that have inflicted numerous losses upon the Palestinian people. She emphasized that the solution to the Palestinian political crisis is to end the Oslo Accords and all subsequent security and economic agreements, and end all forms of security coordination with the occupation state.
She also demanded the formation of a popular Palestinian leadership to develop a program of struggle, including formation of committees for popular protection to activate resistance everywhere Palestinians are, and to escalate the boycott of the occupation at all levels.
She reiterated the Front’s position that the Palestinian Authority’s immediate legislative and presidential elections are not a solution outside reconciliation and ending division on the basis of a political alternative to Oslo and commitment to the resistance.
