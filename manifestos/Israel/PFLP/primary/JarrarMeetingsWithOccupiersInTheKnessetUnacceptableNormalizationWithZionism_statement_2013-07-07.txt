The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine sharply condemned the participation of Palestinian figures in meetings and conferences in the Knesset, saying that such meetings are unacceptable normalization with the Zionist occupation state and pose a real threat to the Palestinian cause.
Comrade Khalida Jarrar, member of the Political Bureau of the PFLP said that “normalization in all its forms with the occupation is unacceptable, a strike against the Palestinian cause, and crosses all red lines,” calling for these meetings to be cancelled, saying they are totally rejected by Palestinians. It was announced that a so-called “two-state solution conference” will take place in the Knesset on Monday, July 8, promoting the Oslo “peace process” on behalf of the Israeli Labor Party and aligned Zionist forces.
Jarrar noted the planned participation in particular of Ashraf al-Ajrami and Khalil Shikaki, saying that these meetings with the occupation must be stopped and that Ajrami and Shikaki must decline these invitations to go to the Knesset. She also urged the Palestinian people to respond to such meetings and all forms of normalization with the occupation.
