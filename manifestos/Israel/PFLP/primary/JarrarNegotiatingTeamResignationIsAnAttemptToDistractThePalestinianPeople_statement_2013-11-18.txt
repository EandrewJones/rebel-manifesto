The resignation of the Palestinian negotiating team with the occupying power is an attempt to distract the Palestinian people on the subject of the negotiations themselves, said Comrade Khalida Jarrar, a member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Furthermore, said Jarrar, it is clear that those who rely on negotiations have no alternatives to bring before the people.
Jarrar demanded a complete and immediate end to the futile negotiations process and the development instead of an alternative national strategy for united resistance, ending all forms of security coordination, ending political arrests, and pursuing the occupier to hold its officials accountable in international fora such as the International Criminal Court.
Jarrar warned against secret negotiations happening behind the scenes as took place in Oslo, saying that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was clear when he referred to confidential negotiations about which no details have been released.
