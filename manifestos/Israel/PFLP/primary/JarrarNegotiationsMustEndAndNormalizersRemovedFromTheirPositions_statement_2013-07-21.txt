Mahmoud Abbas’ return to negotiations with the occupation state is unjustifiable and proves the utter weakness of this Palestinian leadership, said Comrade Khalida Jarrar, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
In an interview with Voice of the People (Sawt al-Shaab) radio station, Jarrar said that negotiations have brought nothing to Palestinians except for concesssions and threats to their rights.
Jarrar said that the PFLP rejects bilateral negotiations and the role of the United States, Israel’s strategic ally and supporter, as the reference for these negotiationss. Furthermore, she noted that even the Central Council of the PLO had affirmed that settlement construction should be halted completely before any negotiations, and that the correct direction for international engagement would be to bring Israeli officials before the International Criminal Court for prosecution for war crimes.
Furthermore, she noted that a leading role is being played in the PLO and the Palestinian leadership by overt advocates of normalization, such as Yasser Abed Rabbo and fellow normalizers, as members of the Executive Committee of the PLO at the same time that they are founders of the Geneva Initiative, an effort that aims to undermine and waive the right of return and facilitate normalization. There are growing popular calls for the removal of all normalizers from Palestinian official positions and leadership, said Jarrar.
She said that the PFLP had demanded in the last meeting of the Executive Committee that Abed Rabbo be expelled, held accountable, and removed from his post as secretary of the Executive Committee of the PLO. Abed Rabbo, said Jarrar, and his fellow normalizers, do not represent the Palestinian people in any way, even if the Palestinian Authority and its leadership say that he should be the spokesperson of the Executive Committee of the PLO.
Jarrar demanded an immediate end to negotiations with the occupation state and a thorough reform of the Palestinian internal front, and the removal of those normalizers who in no way represent the Palestinian people.
