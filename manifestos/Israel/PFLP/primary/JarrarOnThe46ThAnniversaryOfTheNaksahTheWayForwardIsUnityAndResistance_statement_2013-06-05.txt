On the forty-sixth anniversary of the Naksah, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine reiterated its call for a comprehensive national Palestinian review of the previous approach of the Palestinian leadership, highlighting the question of why the Zionist occupation has been maintained until the moment, calling for ending the file on internal division and returning to national reconciliation in order to support the resistance.
Comrade Khalida Jarrar, member of the Political Bureau of the PFLP, said in an interview with Voice of the People radio that “a political review must be aimed at reaching a unified strategy and a new approach, built on resistance for the liberation of Palestine.”
She demanded an end to all of the efforts to encourage the futile and damaging so-called “negotiations” and “peace process” with the Israeli side as it continues its attacks upon Palestinian people and land, saying that these can never substitute for Palestinian self-determination and independence. The Palestinian people are determined to achieve their historical rights, the right of return and the liberation of Palestine, and will maintain the resistance to achieve these goals, Jarrar said.
On the continued internal Palestinian political division, she said that this situation leads objectively to weakening resistance to the occupation and its policies and practices of racism against the Palestinian people.Ending division and restoring national unity will lead to the unification of Palestinian forces and the energies of the Palestinian people in order to confront Zionism and achieve our Palestinian national rights.
