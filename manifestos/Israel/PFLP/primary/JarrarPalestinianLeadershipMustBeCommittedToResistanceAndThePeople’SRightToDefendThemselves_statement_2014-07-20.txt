Comrade Khalida Jarrar, a leader in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said that any Palestinian leadership must be committed to the option of resistance, the people and their right to defend themselves.
In comments to Palestine Today, Jarrar denounced the statements of PA President Mahmoud Abbas regarding the aggression on the Gaza Strip, saying that “The leadership today appears to exist in a different reality from the situation of the Palestinian people in the streets.” She demanded a full and immediate end to security coordination with the enemy, saying that these security commitments by the Palestinian Authority keep the Palestinian people at the mercy of the occupation. She demanded the government of national consensus to uphold their responsibilities to meet the needs of Gaza and confront the ongoing aggression, saying that the occupation is trying to divide the Gaza Strip from the West Bank and the rest of Palestine, and this must not be allowed.
Jarrar urged the people and the resistance in the West Bank to express their anger and demanded that the PA security services stop the repression of Palestinian youth seeking to clash with the occupation, and instead protect the people, and called for the formation of popular leadership on the ground to lead the Palestinian people.
