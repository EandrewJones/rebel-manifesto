The Palestinian people are rising due to their economic needs, said Comrade Khalida Jarrar, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, stating that popular protest cannot and will not be confined to this level, but must also include popular action to confront the occupation, ending the Oslo Accords in their entirety and all of their corollaries, including the Paris economic convention.
Comrade Jarrar said that the so-called market economy of the Palestinian Authority has led to mass impoverishment, rising prices for basic commodities, and increased regressive taxes, and that the solution is a resistance economy.
She noted that the popular protest movement began in Ramallah against price and tax increases and then spread to all areas of the West Bank, saying that the Palestinian Authority is responsible for the Palestinian internal economic policy, its crisis, and its relationship to the occupation. She noted that the Authority has become closely linked to the policies of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, increasing taxes and credit/loan dependency in the economy. She said that the Front supports these popular protests, which must be developed and advanced to confront the Palestinian economic system and the Palestinian Authority.
She also emphasized the need for the popular movement to develop a strategy to move beyond the internal front and escalate the popular struggle against the Zionist occupation and settlers who daily continue their looting and vandalism of Palestinian towns and villages. She emphasized the need for popular action to end division and confront the occupation, saying that the popular movement will be powerless if its vision is confined solely to economic policy.
