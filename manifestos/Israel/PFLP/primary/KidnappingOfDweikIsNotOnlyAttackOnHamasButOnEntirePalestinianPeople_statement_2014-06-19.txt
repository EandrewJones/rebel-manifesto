The occupation forces kidnapped Dr. Abdel Aziz Dweik, President of the Palestinian Legislative Council, many PLC members and over 150 detainees and continuing with raids and abductions until now, said the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, noting that this attack is not aimed solely at Hamas but is in fact an attack on the entire Palestinian national movement and the Palestinian people everywhere.
One of the main reasons for the Zionist escalation and continuation of the raids, arrests and threats to deport abducted detainees to the Gaza Strip, is to undermine Palestinian national unity and push the Palestinian Authority to further repress the resistance. It must be made clear that all reject this Zionist criminal policy by expanding the level of confrontation with the Zionist enemy. The PFLP immediately demands that the Authority entirely end security coordination and stop facilitating the entry and exit of occupation forces to our cities, refugee camps and villages. No Palestinian may participate in the crime of stabbing the resistance in the back.
The battle to capture Zionists is a correct tactic to defend our people against the enemy and our people must close ranks on a national basis on our clear principles, with popular participation and all national and Islamic forces to respond to the crimes of the occupation and its failed war against our people.
