July 4, 2014 – Comrade Leila Khaled, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, saluted the martyred child Mohammed Abu Khdeir, murdered, tortured and burned by Zionist settlers, greeting his mother: “Your son did not burn; he lives in the heart of every Palestinian and every young man who now revolts.”
In an interview with Al-Mayadeen TV, she said that this moment requires immediate action for national unity and the establishment of a new level of struggle to confront occupation and settlements. “Leaders who will not act in this moment must step down,” she said.
She called for an immediate meeting of the National and Islamic Forces to review the current situation, reject the path of Oslo and bring security coordination with the occupation to an end, noting that it is continuing its massive aggression in Gaza and the West Bank and seeks to blockade and impose settlements on the entire land of Palestine.
