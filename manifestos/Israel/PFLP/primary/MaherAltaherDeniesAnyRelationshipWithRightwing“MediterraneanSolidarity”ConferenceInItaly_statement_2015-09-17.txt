Comrade Dr. Maher al-Taher, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, denied any participation in the so-called “Mediterranean Solidarity” conference promoted by the Italian extreme right.
An invitation had been sent to the PFLP from Talal Khreis, but the Front, after investigating the organizations and participants initiating this conference, promptly rejected the invitation.
This deceptive move is only the latest attempt by which movements or groups, right-wing or not, attempt to dignify or cleanse their own image by appropriating that of the Front.
Dr. Maher al-Taher also denounces the improper and inappropriate use of his name and calls for its immediate removal from any advertisement or material publicizing the aforementioned conference.
