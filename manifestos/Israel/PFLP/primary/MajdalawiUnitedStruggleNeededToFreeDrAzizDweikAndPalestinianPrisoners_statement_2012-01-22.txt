Comrade Jamil Majdalawi denounced the arrest of Dr. Aziz Dweik, the president of the Palestinian Legislative Council, by the Zionist occupation on Thursday, January 19, 2012, saying that this act is yet another example of the ongoing crimes of the occupation against the Palestinian people and their rights with the objective of destroying and undermining Palestinian national institutions.
Comrade Majdalawi is a leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council. Majdalawi urged that all Palestinian forces unite to campaign for the immediate release of Dr. Dweik, and to support all Palestinian prisoners.
He noted that the occupation would not succeed in its attempts to undermine Palestinian institutions, and saluted the Palestinian prisoners, noting that Dr. Dweik had recently served three years in the occupation prisons alongside thousands of fellow Palestinians, and that 23 PLC members are currently imprisoned in a campaign of repression that continues to the present day, among them Comrade Ahmad Saâ€™adat, the general secretary of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, who has now been in isolation in occupation prisons for nearly three full years.
