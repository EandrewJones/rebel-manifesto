[singlepic id=583 w=320 h=240 float=right]Comrade Jamil Mizher, Central Committee member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, criticized Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas for his recent statements regarding “turning over the keys of the Palestinian Authority,” noting that these statements were mere maneuvers intended to pressure the international community to push the occupation state to return to absurd and useless negotiations.
In an interview with Al-Alam TV, Mizher said that what was needed, instead, was a unified national strategy on the basis of resistance and Palestinian national constants. Mizher said, “It seems that President Abu Mazen through these statements wants to put pressure on the international community and the Israeli occupation to return to the absurd and damaging negotiations after the Israeli elections.” Mizher said that instead the option of dissolving the authority must be studied seriously by the Palestinian leadership and national forces, as part of a strategy of confrontation with the occupation based on resistance and confrontation of the occupation, including ending the Oslo accords and rebuilding the Palestine Liberation Organization as a mechanism of struggle of the Palestinian people.
Mizher emphasized that the negotiations, that have lasted over 20 years, have achieved nothing for the Palestinian people; the national goals of return, freedom and independence are no closer, and pointed out the remarks of Netanyahu and Lieberman confirming their plans to continue settlement construction and consider Jerusalem the united capital of the occupation.
Mizher noted that the occupation will not stop under the next right-wing extremist government and that in fact the next government may be even more extreme, remarking that the US administration clearly is standing with the occupation and its plans for settlement construction and the Judaization of Jerusalem. The Palestinian people have many alternatives to negotiations, said Mizher, and they only threaten the Palestinian national project with destruction, as do promotions of individual initiatives or the “Arab Peace Initiative,” and reflect the European Union’s pressure to return to negotiations rather than a Palestinian national position.
