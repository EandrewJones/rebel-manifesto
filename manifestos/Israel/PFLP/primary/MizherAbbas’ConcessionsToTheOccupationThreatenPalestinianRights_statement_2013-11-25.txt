Comrade Jamil Mizher, member of the Central Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said that Palestinian Authority President Abu Mazen’s recent indulging in concessions to the occupation indicate greed to obtain any illusory political achievement.
Concessions offered to the occupation will provide nothing for the Palestinian people and in fact threaten Palestinian rights; on the other hand the occupation will use Abbas’ positions to continue to Judaize Jerusalem and impose facts on the ground, said Mizher. He called for a national strategy that prioritize the resistance to confront occupation and hold it accountable for its crimes.
The Authority is exploiting the political division in Palestine while taking positions that implicate the future of the Palestinian cause, said Mizher, saying that internal Palestinian unity is critical.
