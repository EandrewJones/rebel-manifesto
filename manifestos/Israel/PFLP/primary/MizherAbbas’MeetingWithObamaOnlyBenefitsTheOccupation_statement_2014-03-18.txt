Comrade Jamil Mizher, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and leader of its branch in Gaza, said that Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas’ meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama is a net gain for the U.S. administration and the Zionist occupation.
Mizher urged an immediate withdrawal from the negotiations, saying their only purpose is to pressure Palestinians to accept the so-called Framework agreement which aims to liquidate our cause, our rights, and our national constants, particularly the right of return.
He noted that Abu Mazen’s continued participation in the negotiations violates the clear Palestinian national consensus against continuing these negotiations and betting on a settlement with the criminal occupation, noting that the U.S. is entirely aligned with the occupier. Extending negotiations further gives cover to the Zionist occupation to continue its aggression, devour Palestinian land and continue settlement projects, and implement new “facts on the ground.”
Mizher called on all Palestinian forces and factions to pressure Palestinian officials to end the dangerous and absurd negotiations immediately and develop a national strategy to confront the occupation at all political and military levels.
