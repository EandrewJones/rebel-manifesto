Comrade Jamil Mizher, member of the Central Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, warned Palestinian officials against accepting any Zionist offer of an “exchange of territory,” saying that this is a mechanism for the occupation to achieve further settlement and colonization. Mizher demanded that Palestinian officials immediately withdraw from all covert and overt negotiations, saying they are absurd, dangerous, and rejected by the majority of the Palestinian people.
The Zionist “land swap” proposal is not new, Mizher said, it is always what the occupation proposes and includes the annexation of settlemements, rendering the West Bank a dismembered array of isolated cantons. Mizher said that it is time for the Palestinian officials to stop making concessions and granting a lifeline to the occupation, noting that whenever Palestinians make concessions, the occupation only demands more. The occupation state claims all of Jerusalem, refuses Palestinian refugees’ right to return, refused to withdraw from the Jordan valley, said Mizher. “So why negotiate?? Why continue in this absurd and harmful farce? It is time to give priority to ending the division, restoring national unity, and building a national strategy based on adherence to resistance in all forms. Making concessions after concessions serves only the occupation. It will destroy the Palestinian national project if not stopped.”
