Comrade Jamil Mizher, member of the Central Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, called for a comprehensive review of the economic policies of the Palestinian Authority, including ending the Paris economic Conventions that subject the Palestinian economy to total control by the occupation, in an interview on Al-Quds TV on October 18, 2012.
Mizher emphasized the need for national economic action to strengthen the steadfastness of the Palestinian people and protect services. Mizher said that “it is clear that the PA is in a deep economic and social crisis. There is an increase in unemployment and poverty has reached almost 20% in the West Bank, causing social problems and poor living conditions.” He spoke to the PA’s responsibility for the continung crisis, saying that the Israeli occupation bears the first responsibility, especially with its continuous economic war against all Palestinians and the blackmail of the donor countries and the Quartet.
Mizher, however, said that recent actions taken by the Authority will never resolve the economic crisis as long as the PA relies on donor aid and grants, massive debts and International Monetary Fund programs, price increases and regressive tax impositions that only exacerbate the crisis.
