Comrade Jamil Mizher, member of the Central Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said that the PFLP rejects any action that excludes Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon from electing their representatives to the Palestinian National Council, as they constitute the largest part of the Palestinian diaspora.
Mizher said that the topic should be discussed on February 8, including when and how to hold elections in different locations. He said that this issue cannot be decided by a single party and that countries hosting Palestinian refugees must make a real effort to conduct elections for the PNC. He warned against attempts to recreate the quota system to give particular parties total control, and, in particular, any attempt to dilute or exclude refugees’ demands and the right of return through the exclusion of refugees from participating in direct elections to the PNC.
He further said that elections should be conducted according to the principle of proportional representations and must include elections in popular unions to create a true representation of the Palestinian people and their institutions everywhere in diaspora and exile.
