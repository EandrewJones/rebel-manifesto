The victory of the Palestinian resistance in Gaza “has had many important achievements that have rehabilitated the Palestinian national cause after many years of decline, through legendary steadfastness in the face of the Zionist war machine, the achievements of the resistance on the battlefield, and the accomplishments of the united Palestinian delegation…that continued to insist on the demands of our people and the resistance,” said Comrade Jamil Mizher, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and leader of its branch in Gaza, speaking on Al-Jazeera satellite channel as part of a political seminar called “Gaza victorious.”
“One of the most important achievements of our people in the recent Zionist aggression is the failure of the occupation to achieve any of its stated goals, such as ending the firing of rockets – resistance factions launched missiles until the last minute; failing to disarm the resistance; failing to destroy the tunnels; failing to undermine Palestinian national unity. This comes in addition to the popular embrace of the resistance and the cohesion of the internal front that they could not disrupt,” said Mizher. He noted that “te legendary steadfastness of our people confirmed once again that the path of negotiations over twenty years brought nothing to our people…it is resistance, unity and steadfastness of our people that can achieve victory over this criminal enemy.”
“The path of Oslo, negotiations and security coordination must be left forever. Those who remain on that path are caught in a vicious circle, and return to talk about bilateral negotiations…this subject is dangerous, detrimental to our achievements, and only brings us back to the prison of illusion and mirage,” said Mizher.
In response to the statements of Benjamin Netanyahu that the occupation had achievements in the aggression on Gaza, Mizher said that “it is clear that the occupation government is in crisis and real trouble, and the statements of the war criminal Netanyahu demonstrate clearly that he is defeated and shaky and trying to market an illusion to the Zionist public that he has achievements, despite the fact that the resistance rubbed his nose in the sand of the Strip and shattered the myth of the invincible army, and brought down numerous officers and soldiers of his elite units…”
He denounced the Arab official collusion and complicity in the aggression on Gaza, noting that Arab regimes did not take positions that met the seriousness of the situation of our people and their resistance, and that there was no real Arab embrace of the resistance and the Palestinian people, saying if there was such a real Arab support for our people and their steadfastness, resistance, rights and constants, it would have been completely different, and our achievements even greater.
Mizher said that it was necessary to consolidate the accomplishments of the resistance by agreeing on a vision to manage the situation going forward, urging a meeting of the provisional leadership of the PLO and the Islamic factions for an urgent discussion of its responsibilities in rebuilding and reconstruction and deepening national unity.
