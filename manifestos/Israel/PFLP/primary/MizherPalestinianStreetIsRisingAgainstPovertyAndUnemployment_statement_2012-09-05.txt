Comrade Jamil Mizher, member of the Central Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said that the Palestinian street is rising in a real popular movement to confront poverty, rising prices, unemployment and economic deterioration in the West Bank and Gaza, calling for those responsible to be held accountable for the economic crisis and act to ensure Palestinians can live with dignity.
Mizher said that the case of Ehab Abu Nada who set himself afire in Gaza in his despair at unemployment reflects the severe strain faced by Palestinians due to poverty and unemployment, as do the protests taking place throughout the West Bank in response to regressive tax increases and rising prices. He also noted the fundamental responsibility of the occupation – and the Palestinian Authority – for this economic crisis, saying that it demonstrates the failure of the Authorities in Palestine to both confront the occupation and support the steadfastness of the people.
