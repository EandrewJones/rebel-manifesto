It is natural for the resistance to respond to the Israeli occpation so long as it occupies our land and practices daily terror of US-made weapons against our people, said Comrade Jamil Mizher, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and leader of its branch in Gaza.
The response of the resistance, including hundreds of rockets directed toward the bases and settlements of the Zionist occupation, is a necessary response to Zionist terrorism and addressing the balance of terror, as against the policy of appeasement of the occupation that has proved tangibly, through the shedding of Palestinian blood, to be a wrong policy exploited by the occupation as it continues its crimes and aggression, Mizher said.
Mizher renewed the Front’s call to form a unified armed resistance front to include all military wings of the Palestinian resistance factions to determine the tactics of resistance in terms of location, timing, size and quality to respond to the occupation, and emphasized the need to formulate a unified national strategy for resistance and unity, as without that we cannot confront the enemy or achieve victory. He confirmed that the PFLP and the fighters of all resistance organizations will not give up the resistance and will not allow the Zionist occupation to target a single party.
