Comrade Dr. Rabah Muhanna, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, called for the masses of the Palestinian people to take to the streets to support Palestinian youth against the oppression of Palestinian Authority security forces as they protested for the second day against PA repression and security coordination.
Comrade Muhanna said that the attack on these demonstrators – for the second day on Sunday, July 1 – represents the confirmation of the PA’s commitment to security cooperation with the Zionist enemy against the Palestinian people. He said that this represents the suppression of public freedoms against young Palestinian demonstrators defending their rights in public street marches.
He called upon the PLO to uphold its responsibility to protect our people from the oppression of security agencies and full accountability for those responsible for these attacks in the Palestinian Authority, saying that such attacks are directly serving the occupation and oppressing Palestinians defending their rights.
