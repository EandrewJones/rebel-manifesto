Comrade Dr. Rabah Muhanna, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, spoke on April 23 about the occupation’s threats to renew its attacks on the Gaza Strip. He said that any truce with the enemy that does not force the enemy to commit to agreements and stop its crimes against our people is a wrong policy.
Muhanna called on factions that agreed to the truce to reconsider the policy, recognizing that the occupation’s objective is to quell the resistance and implement aggressive policies against our people without consequence. Muhanna also demanded that the Egyptian government, that sponsored this initiative, to take action to defend Palestinian rights and stop Israeli aggression.
He said that the Palestinian people and their resistance forces will certainly direct their forces to confront any Zionist aggression and said that as long as the occupation and aggression continues, so will the resistance by all means, including and especially armed resistance.
