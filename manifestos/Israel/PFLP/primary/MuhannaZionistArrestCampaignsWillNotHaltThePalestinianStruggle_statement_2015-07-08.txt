The recent arrests of the Zionist occupation forces will not deter the Palestinian people and their political forces from continuing their struggle and resistance against the occupation, said Comrade Dr. Rabah Muhanna, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
Muhanna said that “in recent days the Zionist occupation forces have engaged in a wide-ranging arrest campaign against the cadres of the Hamas movement in the West Bank as well as arresting dozens of supporters of the Popular Front and Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian resistance organizations in the West Bank. It seems the occupation has not learned its lesson that arrests will not deter the Palestinian people and their resistance to continue their struggle until liberation.”
The Front also denounced the ongoing political arrests perpetrated by the Palestinian Authority, saying that the security coordination with the occupation must end immediately and demanding the release of Palestinian political detainees from Palestinian Authority jails. “There is no justification for these arrests, which serve only the occupation.”
