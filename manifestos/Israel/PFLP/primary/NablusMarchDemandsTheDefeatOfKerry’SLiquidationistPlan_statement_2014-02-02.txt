The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and other forces in Nablus held a march in Nablus demanding an end to negotiations and the complete rejection of the Kerry plan on October 25.
The marchers called for Palestinian officials monopolizing Palestinian representation to immediately exit these dangerous and absurd negotiations and return to the goals of the people and continue resistance in all forms, confront the occupation in international forum and the United Nations, end the state of division and build a real national program based on fundamental Palestinian rights, particularly the right of return.
Comrade Dr. Yousef Abdul Haq spoke on behalf of the Popular Front calling for rejection of the Kerry plan, a continuation of the Oslo path imposed by the U.S. and Zionism upon our people, and to defend Palestinian rights and end all reliance on the U.S., a strategic ally of Zionism.
