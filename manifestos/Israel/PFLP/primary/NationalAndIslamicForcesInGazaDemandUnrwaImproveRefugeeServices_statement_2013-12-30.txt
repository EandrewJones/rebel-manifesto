The National and Islamic Forces in the Gaza Strip met at the office of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine on December 29 to address issues with services provided by UNRWA, the United Nations Relief Works Agency responsible for services to Palestinian refugees.
The Forces noted that UNRWA holds this responsibility because Palestinians have been made refugees as victims of previous resolutions of the United Nations, primarily the partition of Palestine, and are continually denied their internationally-recognized fundamental national, collective and individual right to return to their homes and lands.
The Forces called upon UNRWA to develop and expand its services to Palestinian refugees, particularly in light of the storm damage and calculated siege of Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza in recent days, and demanded there be no cuts in services provided by UNRWA. The Forces also expressed their support for the rights of UNRWA employees in Palestine in respect to their salaries and the need for Palestinian employeesâ€™ salary to increase in line with the cost of living alongside the salaries of the international employees and managers in the international institutions operating in Gaza.
Furthermore, the Palestinian political forces demanded that UNRWA increase the material quality and quantity of services provided to Palestinian refugees. They rejected any actions by UNRWA to transfer its head office from Gaza to another location or wind down services at any level. They warned against any actions that are harmful to the cause of refugees and contribute to the pressure on them, which may be interpreted as political actions to promote projects aimed at liquidating the rights and concerns of Palestinian refugees, primarily the right to return.
