Saturday, March 14 marks the ninth anniversary of the Zionist occupation forces’ attack on the Jericho Prison of the Palestinian Authorty and the arrest of the General Secretary of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Comrade Ahmad Sa’adat, and Comrades Ahed Abu Ghoulmeh, Majdi Rimawi, Hamdi Qur’an and Basil al-Asmar, as well as Major General Fuad Shobaki.
On this date in 2006, Zionist gangs invaded the Jericho prison and abducted Comrade Ahmad Sa’adat and his comrades in an unspeakable crime in front of the eyes of the world, with the involvement of Britain and the United States and the complicity of the Palestinian Authority and its subservient security forces, who stood by without action as the occupation stormed Jericho.
The purpose of this crime was not only to propagandize for the war criminal Ehud Olmert in the Zionist elections, nor to arrest the Popular Front leaders who carried out the will of the people and avenged the blood of the leader Abu Ali Mustafa by uprooting a symbol of racist terror, Rehavam Ze’evi. The basic objective of the Zionist occupation was the targeting of the concept and vision of resistance represented by Sa’adat and his comrades, to attempt to defeat it and liquidate it.
There was instantaneous outrage to this crime among the popular Palestinian masses inside and outside Palestine, which only confirmed to all the futility of such an objective, as the spirit of resistance is rooted in the minds of the Palestinian people, and no matter how many crimes and attacks, our people will not forget or lose their will.
Comrade Sa’adat confronted the Zionist mockery of a court, refusing to recognize the legitimacy of his military trial, and raising high with defiance his pride in his affiliation with the Popular Front, pledging that the prison cells would become a new arena for him to struggle, and a clear counter-example to the Palestinian Authority’s leadership that continued on the path of security coordination.
