This anniversary must be an occasion to end political arrests and repression, and end security coordination and criminalization of the resistance, said the Prisoners’ Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, remarking on February 23, the 13th anniversary of the Palestinian Authority intelligence service’s criminal arrests of Comrades Ahed Abu Ghoulmeh, Basil al-Asmar and Hamdi Qur’an, for their participation in the Palestinian resistance action targeting the Zionist racist cabinet minister Rehavam Zeevi.
The Prisoners’ Committee emphasized that the repercussions of this deception and crime against the Palestinian national struggle cannot be forgotten; it was a harsh blow to Palestinian national relations and the pain continues, as these comrades were abducted with Comrades Ahmad Sa’adat and Majdi Rimawi, as well as Fouad Shoubaki, from the PA’s Jericho prison in 2006 and are held today in Israeli prisons.
The Committee demanded that the PA’s security apparatus comply with the demand of the Palestinian people to release all political prisoners from its jails unconditionally and end its position as a spectator or an obstacle, and instead contribute to the defense of the Palestinian people and confront the occupation and settlers.
