[singlepic id=594 w=320 h=240 float=right]On the eleventh anniversary of the kidnapping of Ahmad Sa’adat by the Palestinian Authority, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine issued a press statement condemning political arrests, calling for the end of the use of Palestinian prisons to hold political prisoners and suppress the resistance at the behest of the Zionist occupier. Political arrests are a crime against the Palestinian national and social fabric and are contrary to the values and heritage of struggle and the moral strength of the Palestinian people and only serve the interests of the occupation.
The PFLP demanded that Palestinian prisons be emptied of political detainees, remembering the January 15, 2002 kidnapping of PFLP General Secretary Ahmad Sa’adat in Ramallah by the Palestinian Authority security and intelligence services. The Authority bears the responsibility for his imprisonment for over four years in Palestinian prison and the later kidnapping of Sa’adat by the occupation forces from the Authority’s preison in Jericho, where he was sentenced to thirty years in prison by an occupation military court.
The Front emphasized the absolute necessity to protect the rights and liberties of Palestinian citizens and their sacred right to resist the occupation. Furthermore, the Front noted that if the UN “statehood” resolution is to be given any credibility, the Authority should stop acting as an Authority on behalf of the occupation and instead act as a state, in which security services act to protect the Palestinian people rather than their occupier, by ending security coordination and cancelling all commitments to security cooperation with the occupier. This, said the Front, is the mechanism to restore national unity and end division, noting that ongoing political arrests of Palestinians is a major cause of division.
The Front urged the national reconciliation commission to uphold its responsibilities in this regard, including launching an investigation to find those responsible for torture and political arrests and hold them accountable, and to end the security coordination with the occupation that strikes at the heart of Palestinian national unity. Instead, national unity must be based on the Palestinian people’s resistance and struggle in order to defeat the settler colonial occupation, liberate the prisoners, and win our freedom, independence and return.
