The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine issued a statement on the sixth anniversary of the assault on Jericho prison and the Israeli kidnapping of the General Secretary of the PFLP and Palestinian national leader Ahmad Sa’adat and his comrades.
The PFLP stated that Britain and the United States bear responsibility as well as the occupation for their coordination with the occupation both to imprison Comrade Sa’adat and then to support the kidnapping operation, which ended with the destruction of Jericho prison and the kidnapping of Ahmad Sa’adat and his comrades, Majdi Rimawi, Ahed Abu Ghoulmeh, Hamdi Qur’an and Basil al-Asmar, and Fouad Shoubaki.
Furthermore, the PFLP said that this crime must reveal the bankruptcy of those who rely on negotiations and their sponsors – that the occupation respects no agreement and the US and the UK bear responsibility for that very violation. That six years later, the Palestinian Authority continues along the path of Oslo and negotiations makes clear that the PA has not learned the lessons of Jericho.
The PFLP called for international legal accountability and prosecution for the crime of kidnapping and the storming of the prison for the US, British and Israeli officials responsible for this crime, and demanded that the PA end its reliance on the Quartet, “negotiations”, and the so-called “peace process,” saying that the entire path of Oslo and all associated agreements must be reviewed and repudiated, putting an end to security and economic cooperation with the occupier.
The Front emphasized that the immediate task of our people and all political and social forces is to unify to confront the occupation and its plans to liquidate the Palestinian cause. Resistance to the occupation must be escalated, said the Front, and all Palestinian forces must support all forms of this legitimate resistance to defeat the occupation, end colonization, free our prisoners, and achieve freedom, self-determination and return.
