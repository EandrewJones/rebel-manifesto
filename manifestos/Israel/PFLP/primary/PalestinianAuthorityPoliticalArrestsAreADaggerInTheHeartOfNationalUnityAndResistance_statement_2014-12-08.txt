While the barbaric Zionist racist attack continues to escalate against our Palestinian people in Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza, and occupied Palestine 1948, the security agencies of the Palestinian Authority continue to launch arrest campaigns against Palestinian youth in various areas of the West Bank. In recent weeks, multiple young people have been arrested by PA security, particularly at Bir Zeit University. Some remain in detention under flimsy political arguments and justifications.
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine reaffirms that the continuation of political arrests is a dagger in the heart of the Palestinian national liberation movement, unity and resistance, and emphasizes the following:
1) We call for an an immediate end to this dangerous policy that undermines unity and resistance, and the need for an immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners.
2) The continuation of political arrests undermine efforts to unite our people and support their steadfastness in the face of the occupation attacks.
3) These political arrests are not based on any legitimate justification, and are a service to the occupation who often re-arrests these youth when they are released, known as the “revolving door policy.”
4) We re-emphasize the need for the PA to immediately end all forms of security coordination with the Zionist occupation.
