Left organizations in Ramallah organized a march from Manara Square on Wednesday, March 19, chanting against US Secretary of State John Kerry’s so-called framework agreement and demanding an end to the continuation of the negotiations with the occupation.
Comrade Khalida Jarrar, a leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said this is the first of a series of escalating popular actions to put pressure on the Palestinian Authority leadership to end the negotiations due to clear popular rejection of John Kerry’s liquidationist plan. She noted that the Palestinian people see the dangerous confidentiality in these negotiations, which negotiators refuse to discuss while the occupation escalates its violence, expands settlements, and increases cold-blooded killing and reckless arrogance in its political discourse, which now demands recognition of the “Jewishness” of the occupation state and its right to settle Palestinian land as a condition for approval of the Kerry plan, which is even worse for the Palestinian people than the notorious and devastating Oslo agreement. She said the negotiations must end immediately and that it was necessary to demand justice and accountability from international institutions and the escalation of popular resistance.
