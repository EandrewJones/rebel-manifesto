The Palestinian National and Islamic Forces called for a rally against the resumption of negotiations under US auspices on Sunday, August 4, 2013 at 12 noon in Manara Square in Ramallah. This follows on multiple rallies against negotiations following last Sunday’s marches in Ramallah and Gaza.
Palestinians in Al-Khalil (Hebron) rallied on Friday, August 2 to protest the return to negotiations by PA President Mahmoud Abbas.
Participants included members and supporters of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, as well as members of the Democratic Front and the People’s Party. The demonstrators said that the return to negotiations violates even the decisions of PLO institutions, in particular the Central Council, and the abuse of individual authority by deciding to retun to the absurd negotiations that violate all Palestinian conditions and principles set forth.
In particular, the demonstrators said that these negotiations look at the US as a reference, ignoring the Palestinian principle of adhering to international law and UN resolutions as a basis for any discussion. The marchers carried Palestinian flags and signs against the negotiations, and emphasizing the need to uphold the right of return as a non-negotiable individual and collective right.
