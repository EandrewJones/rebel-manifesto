Representatives of the Palestinian factions in Algeria expressed their solidarity with Palestinian refugees in Syria, and their rejection of the dangerous Kerry project, demanding an immediate end to the negotiations.
The Palestinian factions in Algeria held an event attended by Palestinian students at Algerian universities and the Palestinian community in Algeria. Comrade Salah Mohammad addressed the event on behalf of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
He addressed the need to provide support to the Palestinian refugee camps in Syria, in particular Yarmouk camp. He also demanded the rejection of the U.S.â€™ planned framework agreement orchestrated by Secretary of State John Kerry, emphasizing the importance of mobilizing Palestinian and Arab popular pressure to expose the goals of this project and ensure its defeat, noting that this is an attempt to liquidate Palestinian rights, particularly the right of return.
The event attendees resolved to re-activate the Committee for the Defense of the Right to Return in response to events in Yarmouk and the attempts to liquidate the right of return through the so-called negotiations.
