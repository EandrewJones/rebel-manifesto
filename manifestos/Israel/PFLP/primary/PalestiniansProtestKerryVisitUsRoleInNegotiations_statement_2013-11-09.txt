Palestinians protested in Bethlehem on November 6, 2013, against the visit of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to Palestine, given the U.S. extensive support to the occupation. Protesters condemned Kerry’s visit to Palestine and the ongoing crimes of the occupation, including the settlements being built throughout the West Bank, demanding an end to the occupation, and an end to the futile and dangerous negotiations, and raising slogans calling for a third intifada. The demonstrators were surrounded by Palestinian Authority security services, blocking access to the main road leading to the presidential palace where PA President Mahmoud Abbas was meeting with Kerry.
At the same time, Comrade Jamil Mizher, member of the Central Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, warned of American/Israeli attempts to impose a solution at the expense of Palestinian national rights by means of financial bribery and extortion. “These negotiations are continuing as settlements are built, the Judaization of Jerusalem, attempts to divide al-Aqsa mosque and the continued killings of our people, and today alongside the martyrdom of the struggling prisoner Hassan al-Turabi,” said Mizher. The occupier has nothing to offer Palestinians in these so-called rounds of negotiations, Mizher said, and seeks a security solution, recognition of the “Jewishness” of the Zionist state and protection of the security of its criminal state. The occupation government of fascism and the Netanyahu/Lieberman alliance seeks a solution that is even worse than the Oslo accords, including a final solution of “self-rule,” total dismissal of the issues of Jerusalem and refugees, said Mizher.
Mizher said that there is a Palestinian consensus that Jerusalem is the eternal Palestinian capital and this is not subject to bargain with the occupation, demanding the Palestinian Authority end its participation in these negotiations immediately.
