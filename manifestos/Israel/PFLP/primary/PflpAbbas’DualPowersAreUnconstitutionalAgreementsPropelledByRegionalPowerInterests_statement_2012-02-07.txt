The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said on February 6, 2012 that it is very concerned that regional power interests are the real motivation behind the agreement between Hamas and Fateh announced today in Doha, the capital of Qatar. Furthermore, the Front noted its deep concern about the news that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, Abu Mazen, had also been appointed Prime Minister of the PA Government, in violation of the Basic Law passed by the Palestinian Legislative Council requiring the separation of these powers.
Comrade Kayed al-Ghoul, member of the Central Committee of the PFLP and leader of its branch in Gaza, said in a televised interview with Al-Jazeera that there had been, prior to this meeting, no effort or activity to implement the earlier reconciliation agreement signed in Cairo over a nearly 9 month period. He said that mechanisms had been agreed upon in December 2011, that were once again disregarded and asked whether the “blessings of Qatar” had pushed the two parties to agree on the name of Abu Mazen – already PA President – as Prime Minister in what is claimed to be a government of national consensus, despite the fact that such an action is illegal under the PA’s own laws.
