The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine issued a statement on April 7, 2012 denouncing the meeting between Yossi Beilin and member of the PLO Executive Committee Yasser Abed Rabbo, saying that this meeting takes place in the framework of the so-called “Geneva Initiative” (that aims to undermine Palestinian refugees’ right to return) and the state with provisional borders, and is yet another attempt to reduce the political demands and minimize the Palestinian national situation. The Front noted that this meeting is yet another trial balloon, aimed at dragging Palestinians once more into futile negotiations with the occupation state and the pursuit of bilateral “solutions” under the reference of the United States and amid ongoing war crimes, settlement building, and attacks against the Palestinian people.
The Front warned that such meetings consolidate the fragmentation on the Palestinian national scene and are a failed attempt to cover up the failure of negotiations and the so-called “International Quartet’s” refusal to compel the occupying power to implement international law and UN resolutions, holding the occupation state immune from any accountability while it engages in flagrant violations and disregard of international humanitarian and human rights law. The Front reiterated once more that neither such meetings nor the machinations of the Quartet will undermine Palestinian rights to sovereignty, self-determinatio, and return.
The Front called upon political and social forces to take action and for the PLO to make clear that such meetings are unacceptable and harmful to our people and our cause.
