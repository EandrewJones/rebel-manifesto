In response to the Israeli occupationâ€™s administrative detention order for six months against Palestinian leader and Palestinian Legislative Council member Khalida Jarrar, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said that it is confident that this racist, fascist state and its attacks will in no way lessen or undermine the determination and resilience of the struggler Jarrar, nor will it lessen her ability to challenge and resist the occupier. She is an example of the great steadfastness of the Palestinian people, who do not stop resisting the occupation despite arrests or expulsions, as she did when she challenged and defeated the order expelling her to Jericho.
The Front urged a wider campaign of solidarity with Jarrar and urged all Palestinian official institutions to uphold their responsibilities to act urgently on political and diplomatic levels in order to release her.
