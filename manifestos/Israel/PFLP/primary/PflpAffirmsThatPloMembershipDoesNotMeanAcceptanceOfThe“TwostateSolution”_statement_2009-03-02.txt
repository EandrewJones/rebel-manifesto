The PFLP does not accept the “two-state solution” as the final goal for the Palestinian people or the Palestinian cause, but instead views the strategic goal as the liberation of all of Palestine, said Comrade Marwan Fahoum, “Abu Sami,” a member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said on March 2, 2009.
The PFLP’s acceptance of the establishment a Palestinian state on all territories occupied in 1967 with Jerusalem as its capital, and the return of all refugees to their homes from which they were driven, is part of the only acceptable solution to progress towards achieving the strategic goal, the liberation of all of Palestine, said Comrade Fahoum.
Comrade Fahoum stated firmly that this does not mean in any way that the PFLP accepts the “two-state solution,” as a final goal for the Palestinian people or the Palestinian cause, and it does not mean that the PFLP accepts in any way the commitments of Oslo and subsequent “agreements” including the roadmap, the Annapolis agreement, or any other such products of the so-called “peace process.”
This statement came in response to the statement of PA President Mahmoud Abbas, Abu Mazen, stating that all PLO member organizations, those currently in the PLO and those that will join, as well as all factions taking part in a government of national reconciliation, must commit themselves to the “two-state solution” and the acceptance of the Oslo agreements and other “agreements” of the “peace process.” Comrade Fahoum stated that any confusion must be cleared up about the presence of the PFLP in the PLO, stating that the PLO is the overarching framework of the Palestinian people in all of its components, but that does not preclude member organizations’ and factions’ own vision of the nature of the Arab-Zionist conflict and what is necessary to end that conflict.
Comrade Fahoum explained that the PFLP sees the Arab-Zionist conflict as one that cannot be completed or ended with the establishment of the Palestinian state, but only with the establishment of a secular democracy on all of the land of historic Palestine, with equality for all its people.
