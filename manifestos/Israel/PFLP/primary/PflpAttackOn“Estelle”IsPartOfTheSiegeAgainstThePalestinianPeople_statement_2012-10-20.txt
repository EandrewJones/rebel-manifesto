The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said that the Zionist attack on the solidarity ship Estelle, sailing to Gaza to break the siege on the Palestinian people, is yet another crime by the brutal occupation against the Palestinian people.
The occupation spurns all humanitarian and legal norms and continues its siege upon Gaza, said the Front, and this attack is part of that siege on our people.
The Front saluted the international activists who sailed to break the siege, as a part of the widening popular solidarity campaign with the just Palestinian cause throughout the world.
The Front called on international human rights organizations to expose the crimes of the occupation, hold it accountable, and lift the unjust siege on our people, calling on all progressive forces of freedom in the world to intensify campaigns of solidarity with Palestine and its people.
