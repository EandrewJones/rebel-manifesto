The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine confirmed that the continuation of the occupier and colonizer attacks on the Palestinian city of Jerusalem and its people, the latest of which was the storming of the Al-Aqsa mosque on 26 July and attacking worshipers, wounding dozens, is the spark that can ignite the next explosion to burn the power of the occupier.
The Front called upon the masses and the youth of Jerusalem to continue their ongoing response to the Zionist attack on the city and its holy sites. The Palestinian people have always continuously resisted all of the Zionist plans to Judaize the land and the holy places of Jerusalem.
The Front also called for an emergency meeting of the Palestinian leadership of the Executive Committee to be held to discuss the repercussions of this dangerous development at Al-Aqsa Mosque, and plan practical actions to confront the Zionist attacks and support the steadfastness of our people in Jerusalem, beyond speeches and statements.
The Popular Front called on the United Nations to act immediately to end the ongoing violations and crimes of the Zionist entity, considering that what is happening in occupied Palestine, including the city of Jerusalem, rise to the level of war crimes and should be prosecuted and the occupier held accountable on an international level.
The Front also called on the Organization of the Islamic Conference to take action to uphold its commitments and decisions that have accumulated for the city of Jerusalem, and to support the steadfastness of its people; since the formation of the Organization, those resolutions and decisions have led to no real action.
The rehabilitation of the Palestinian cause in the mind and conscience of the Arab nation is a central issue, and the first task of the progressive and democratic forces, after it has been marginalized amid the state of occupation, destruction and sectarianism that have targeted the Arab countries in the service of Western imperialist schemes.
