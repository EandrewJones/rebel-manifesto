The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine saluted the Palestinian masses and the youth of the intifada facing attacks and invasions by occupation forces today and yesterday in Qalandiya and Dheisheh refugee camps, where the invading forces killed two young heroes, Ahmad Jahajha, 21, and Hekmat Hamdan, 29, injuring and arresting dozens more.
The Front reaffirmed that all of the attempts by the occupation to attack and suppress the Palestinian refugee camps, targeted with daily incursions and mass arrests, will not succeed in quelling the intifada. These attacks on Shuafat yesterday and on Qalandiya and Dheisheh today will be repeated again in Palestinian camps and villages and will face only increased will, steadfastness and resistance.
The Front noted that the occupationâ€™s escalation of its policy of arrests and introducing two additional battalions of colonial occupation soldiers to the West Bank early next year reveal its inability to confront the intifada and the rising of Palestinian youth, and are a tacit admission that all of its policies, procedures and practices have failed to stop the intifada and will continue to fail until the full recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people.
