The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the bombings in the Karrada district of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, which killed hundreds of martyrs and wounded many more, as a horrific massacre reflecting brutality beyond depiction, urging unity to defeat the forces of destruction.
The Front emphasized that the enemies of the Arab nation, especially the United States and the Zionist entity, are the main beneficiaries of such massacres in Arab countries, and that the direct cause of these massacres is the US occupation of Iraq as the basic crime that has spawned this destruction.
The Front further emphasized that these bloody massacres will continue to attack the people of Iraq so long as the nation remains chained and fettered by its agreements with the US administration and the sectarian, confessional and ethnic division and oppression spawned and fostered by the occupation.
The fundamental solution to the situation in Iraq reqires the rebuilding of a pluralistic, democratic, Iraq, that is anti-imperialist and supports the causes of the Arab nation, particularly the Palestinian cause, and struggles to defend the people in the face of Zionist attacks.
The Front expressed its strongest solidarity with the Iraqi people, emphasizing that Palestine, Iraq, and the entire Arab homeland are the victims of these projects of division and destruction.
