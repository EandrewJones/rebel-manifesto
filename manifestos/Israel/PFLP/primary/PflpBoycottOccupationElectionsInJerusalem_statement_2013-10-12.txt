The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine called for a boycott of the occupation municipal elections in the city of Jerusalem. The Front called on our people in the city of Jerusalem, the eternal capital of the Palestinian people, to boycott these occupation elections which are part of the policy of Judaizing Jerusalem in various fields. This includes undermining the Arab status of Jerusalem and the political, spiritual, cultural, economic and social development of our people, and repression of the people of the city of Jerusalem.
The Front said that the occupation authorities in Jerusalem are pushing demographic and geographic changes through rampant settlement, home demolitions, economic strangulation, ethnic cleansing and compromising of sacred Islamic and Christian holy sites. These acts are invalid and contrary to historical facts and international law, and are part of the war crimes being waged against the Palestinian people, their land, holy sites and inalienable rights to return, self-determination and  sovereignty.
