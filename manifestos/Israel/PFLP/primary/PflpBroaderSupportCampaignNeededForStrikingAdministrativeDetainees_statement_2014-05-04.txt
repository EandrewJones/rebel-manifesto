The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine called for a broader campaign of solidarity with the administrative detainees who have now been engaged in a hunger strike for 10 days. Calling upon the Palestinian people, the Arab nation, and forces of justice in the world, the Front urged all to intensify efforts to build a pressure campaign and strengthen international solidarity with the administrative detainees on hunger strike.
The PFLP urged human rights organizations and Palestinian officials to pursue the prisonersâ€™ case in international institutions to stop the attacks of the racist occupation, demanding the freedom of all Palestinian prisoners.
The PFLP said that the struggle of the administrative detainees is a key battle in the ongoing series of confrontations by the prisoners to end the injustice of adminstrative detention, practiced by the occupation against our people without laws, without standards, without trials. The PFLP warned against any attempt to break the strike and emphasized the need to support the steadfastness of the heroic prisoners and bring an end to the occupation abuses of the prisoners, including administrative detention.
