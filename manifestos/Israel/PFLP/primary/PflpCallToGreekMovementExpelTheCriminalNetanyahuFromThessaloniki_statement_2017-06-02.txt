The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine calls on all Greek movements for social justice and supporters of Palestine to rally, organize and protest against the visit of the Prime Minister of the occupation state, the war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been announced as participating in a tripartite summit with Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and the president of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, on 15 June.
The PFLP urged all friendly Greek forces and parties to fight the intensifying political, military and economic ties between Greece and the Zionist entity, which necessarily come at the expense of the Palestinian and Arab people whose resources and rights have been confiscated by the occupier, while opening the wealth of the Greek people to looting by the U.S. and Zionist state. The Front denounced the role of the Syriza-ANEL government in escalating this relationship between Greece and the Zionist occupation state to unprecedented levels at the expense of the Greek and Palestinian peoples and their gas and water wealth and resources. The Front confirmed that this path of betting on the U.S. and Zionism to solve the economic crisis will fail.
The Front urged all members and institutions of the Palestinian and Arab community in the city of Thessaloniki to participate actively in demonstrations against Netanyahu’s visit and to take the streets and exercise their right to reject this visit and demonstrate their anger against the daily crimes of the Zionist occupation against the Palestinian people before the eyes of the world. The Front also urged all friends of Palestine to take urgent action to expel Netanyahu from Thessaloniki and from Greece altogether, and to make it clear that such war criminals are unwelcome to the Greek people.
Further, the Front urged the further escalation of the role of popular movements against fascism and Zionism and Greece and the development of the international movement to boycott the corporations and institutions of the occupation state in order to isolate it regionally and globally.
