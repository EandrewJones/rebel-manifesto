The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine called for the broadest national action to support the prisoners’ movement, their strike and their goals, which begins on April 17, Palestinian Prisoners’ Day. The Front called upon Palestinians in Palestine and all areas of exile and diaspora, and for all official and popular institutions to plan to engage effectively – as the struggle of the prisoners is the struggle of the whole Palestinian people. The Front said that the prisoners are the vanguard of the Palestinian people, inside the camps and prisons of the occupation, and are key to ending the occupation, racism, colonialism, and achieving the rights of our people to liberation, self-determination, and return.
The Front called for the urgent formation of a national committee involving all Palestinian forces to support the document approved by the prisoners’ representatives from all political forces in the prisons, and to develop a comprehensive national strategy to engage on Palestinian, Arab and international levels to confront the occupation internationally for its violations of international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions, to hold it accountable for its war crimes, racism and apartheid nature.
The Front noted that it is important to refer back to the principle – and the UN resolution – that Zionism is a form of racism – and demand the UN and its institutions fulfil their responsibilities to act for the Palestinian people and prisoners to enable our people to achieve our freedom, sovereignty, self-determination and return.
