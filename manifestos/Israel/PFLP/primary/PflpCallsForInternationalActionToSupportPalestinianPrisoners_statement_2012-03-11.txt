The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine called upon the movements and forces of international solidarity to take up the struggle of Palestinian political prisoners as a key priority. The PFLP emphasized that the coming weeks lead up to April 17, 2012, which will mark Palestinian Prisoners’ Day.
The Front called for international actions to join with actions aross Palestine on that day, raising the profile of Palestinian political prisoners. Furthermore, the Front called for March 14-16, 2012 to be considered days of struggle to support our brave prisoners, coinciding with the anniversary of the storming of Jericho prison six years ago, and the kidnapping of the General Secretary of the Front, Comrade Ahmad Sa’adat and his comrades by the Israeli occupation army.
The PFLP saluted the important and indeed, central role of the movement in solidarity with Palestine at many levels, in particular in opposition to Israeli racism and apartheid, fighting the Apartheid Wall, efforts to break the siege on Gaza, and building unity with our Palestinian people in exile and diaspora.
