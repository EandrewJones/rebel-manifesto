The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine calls on the Palestinian masses inside Palestine and in exile and diaspora to organize to confront and bring down the so-called “French initiative” and any similar international or Arab projects that seek to liquidate Palestinian rights under the guise of “peace negotiations,” particularly the right of return of Palestinian refugees to their homes and lands.
The Front called for June 3-4 to be days of mass struggle, protest and activity to reject the French initiative and work to stop all of these suspicious activities that are in full swing in order to revive the marketing of the so-called “peace process.”
The Popular Front also called on all Palestinian forces and national figures to express clearly their rejection of the French initiative, particularly in response to the attempt of the monopolistic Palestinian Authority leadership o promote this initiative, which seriously undermines the Palestinian national consensus, noting that the initiative was never even presented to the Palestine Liberation Organization’s responsible bodies or discussed with the Palestinian political forces.
