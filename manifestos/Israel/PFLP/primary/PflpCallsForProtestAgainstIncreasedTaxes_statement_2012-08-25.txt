The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is calling for a demonstration in protest of the high cost of living and the Palestinian Authority’s proposed increase in the value-added tax on Tuesday, August 28, 2012. The PFLP called upon popular organizations, political forces and civil society groups to join in the protest against policies that only exacerbate high prices and a regressive tax that does not distinguish between unemployed, poor and working class people and wealthy people, noting that these policies come hand in hand with the degradation of living conditions, civil rights and freedoms, university access, and health and educational services.
The protest will take place Tuesday, 28/8/2012 at 12 noon in front of the Council of Ministers in Ramallah, demanding that the PA heed the voice of the people, meet the needs of the people and put an end to corruption and the waste of public money.
