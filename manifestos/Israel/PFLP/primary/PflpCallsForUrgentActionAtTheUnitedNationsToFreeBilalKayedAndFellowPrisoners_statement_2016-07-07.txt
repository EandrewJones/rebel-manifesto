The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine demanded that the Palestine Liberation Organization, and all of the Palestinian resistance and civil society organizations, raise the level of priority of the prisoners’ struggle. The Front called on the State of Palestine Mission to the United Nations to act quickly at the international level to build official condemnations of administrative detention and the occupation practices against Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and take up its responsibilities toward the prisoners’ movement, which represents the conscience and the resistance of the Palestinian people.
The Front emphasized the need for an emergency session of the General Assembly of the United Nations to discuss the urgent situation of Palestinian prisoners and condemn the occupation’s attacks on them, and to condemn the continuation of the imprisonment of the leader Bilal Kayed, demanding his immediate release and return to his home and family. The administrative detention order against him after the completion of his sentence, his solitary confinement amid deteriorating health in an open hunger strike, and the threat of deportation to Jordan constitute clear crimes and violations of international law.
The Front affirmed that the Zionist occupier has full responsibility for the life and health of Comrade Bilal Kayed and called for the broadest solidarity campaign at all levels, official and popular, with him and with all of the Palestinian prisoners struggling for freedom in Israeli jails.
