Falah Abu Maria
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine called for urgent international action to stop the escalating crimes of the Zionist entity against the Palestinian people, which have taken on multiple forms in recent days.
The PFLP considered that the escalation of these crimes, the latest of which was the murder of Falah Abu Maria and the wounding of his two sons in Beit Ummar, the murder of Mohammed Alawneh from Jenin refugee camp, and the decision of the illegitimate occupation court to deport the children of the martyr Ghassan Abu Jamal from the city of Jerusalem, as well as the approval of the constructions of colonization units in the West Bank, the continued raids and incursions into Palestinian villages and cities, the ongoing and escalating campaign of arrests and the attacks on prisoners, must inspire us all to move relentlessly and without complacency or submission to Zionist or international pressures to hold Zionist officials accountable before international courts, in particular the International Criminal Court.
The Zionist entity must be criminalized and delegitimized on an international level and its political and military leaders and settlers brought before these courts for crimes committed before the sight of the entire world.
The Front noted that the decision of the illegitimate Zionist court, ordering that the children of the Jerusalemite martyr Ghassan Abu Jamal be forced to leave the city by early October is a serious crime, and a part of the systematic Zionist policy aimed at changing the demographic character of Jerusalem and the imposition of an exclusive Jewish character on the city through the forced expulsion of Palestinians. This is a serious violation of international law and the Geneva Conventions, as well as covenants protecting the rights of children.
Of course the decision to build new colonies in the occupied West Bank is nothing strange or new to an entity founded on terror and the expulsion of indigenous people from their homes, it is the practical embodiment of the permanent program of the Zionist state through its successive governments, and especially that of the settlers and extremists of the current government.
The Front emphasized that the response of this crime requires the full involvement and development of our peopleâ€™s militancy in all levels of struggle, including political and diplomatic struggle, which includes putting an end to any covert or overt attempts to return to negotiations, immediately ending the criminalization of resistance and political arrests which abuse the rights of our people and our cause and serve only the interests of the occupation in targeting the resistance and its members. Our people have a legitimate right to resist and to be free of political persecution and arrests.
In addition, the Front emphasized the importance of working with international organizations in solidarity with the Palestinian people and with the forces of democracy and justice in the world to strengthen the boycott of the occupation at all levels, academic, economic, cultural, military and political, to intensify the material negative impact on the Zionist state and impose serious losses, particularly on the economic front.
