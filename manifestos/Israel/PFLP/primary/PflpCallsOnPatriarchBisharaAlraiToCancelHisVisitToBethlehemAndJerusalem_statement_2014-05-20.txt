The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine called upon the Lebanese Maronite Patriarch, Bishara al-Rai, to cancel his visit to Jerusalem and Bethlehem under occupation, under the auspices of the occupation state and the protection of its forces in a statement issued May 17. The Front noted that the cities of Jerusalem and Bethlehem are suffering from army invasions and constant settlement expansion and Judaization, and that at this time, such a visit provides a free service to the occupation which intends to deceive global public opinion, particularly Christian public opinion.
The occupation is attempting to do this while at the same time targeting Christians and their holy sites, just as it does with Muslims, said the Front. The PFLP, noting the status of the Patriarch and what he represents, called upon him to reverse his decision to accompany the Pope on his visit to these cities, as the outcome of the visit will be subject to political exploitation and will be used to promote normalization of the occupation state in the region and to attempt to weaken the growing international movement to boycott the occupation state.
The Campaign to Boycott Supporters of Israel in Lebanon and others have called upon the Patriarch to cancel his visit, noting the Palestinian call for BDS as well as the Zionist movementâ€™s attempts to use this trip as a propaganda ploy.
