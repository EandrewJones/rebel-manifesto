The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced Palestinian corporations that participated in the trade fair currently taking place in the capital of the occupation state, saying such participants directly harm the Palestinian cause and their participation is exploited by the occupation to cover up its crimes against our people.
Comrade Khalida Jarrar, member of the Political Bureau of the PFLP, said that the participation of Palestinian companies and businesspeople in such meetings is very dangerous, and that the Palestinian people reject any meetings working to normalize relations with the occupation.
Jarrar said that such Palestinian businesspeople are acting to serve their personal interests as exemplified in the so-called “Breaking the Impasse” initiative, saying such normalization meetings by large capitalists are not new, but are now being openly proclaimed.
Jarrar said that such meetings must be confronted and the boycott of the occupation on all levels must be intensified – cultural, economic and political.
Jarrar said that US Secretary of State John Kerry’s economic initiative aims to pressure Palestinians to resume negotiations with the occupation state. Jarrar said that all Palestinian officials must take a clear position and reject back-room meetings with Zionists and normalization projects through prominent meetings in order to secure a route back into the dangerous and absurd negotiations process, while the Palestinian people continue to suffer at the hands of the occupation authorities throughout Palestine.
