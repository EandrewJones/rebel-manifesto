The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine commemorated the first anniversary of the occupation forces’ murder of the struggler, Comrade Moataz Washaha, visiting the tomb of the martyr and his family’s home in Bir Zeit village. PFLP leader Comrade Khalida Jarrar joined a delegation of the Union of Palestinian Women’s Committees, led by Khitam Saafin, and of the Progressive Democratic Student Pole at Bir Zeit University.
Comrade Jarrar spoke at Washaha’s graveside, pledging to continue the struggle and the resistance until we achieve the goals of the Palestinian people: return and liberation.
Also on the occasion on the first anniversary of the killing of Washaha, the Zionist occupation forces attacked hundreds of young Palestinians near Atara checkpoint, wounding 8 with rubber-coated metal bullets.
Jarrar presented a honorary plaque to Washaha’s family in a visit to his family home, pledging to remain true to his commitments to Palestine; it was received by his mother, who said that “Moataz remains in the hearts, the thoughts and the conscience of all freedom fighters of our people.” Washaha was murdered by occupation forces on February 27, 2014, shot 62 times as he was attacked in his home and refused to turn himself over to the occupation army, assassinated in cold blood.
