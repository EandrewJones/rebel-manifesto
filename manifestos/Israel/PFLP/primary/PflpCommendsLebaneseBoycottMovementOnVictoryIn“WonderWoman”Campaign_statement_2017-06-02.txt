The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine commended the efforts of the Campaign to Boycott Supporters of “Israel” in Lebanon on many achievements in recent months and years in confronting cultural and political normalization and promoting the boycott of the occupation and complicit corporations. Its most recent victory came on May 31 with the success of the campaign to bar the screening of the film “Wonder Woman,” starring a former Zionist soldier and promoter of occupation and apartheid in the title role.
The Front considers this achievement a victory for Palestine, Lebanon and the culture of resistance. It would not have been possible without the efforts of the campaign and the committed journalists, writers and intellectuals determined to resist occupation and normalization. Confronting normalization and building the boycott of the enemy in various locations and contexts is a part of the resistance and overall struggle and an expression of rejection of the acceptance of occupation, apartheid and racism.
The Front reiterated that this campaign in Lebanon is a model for popular and official campaigns throughout the Arab world and should be replicated, exposing the falsity and deception of the reactionary Arab regimes and their lackeys that promote normalization with the Zionist entity and suspicious political projects. Boycott is an effective weapon that is not in any way incompatible with the armed resistance but rather is complementary, strengthening and deepening all forms and means of struggle against the occupying racist entity.
