The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine commended the Norwegian decision by public officials to prohibit tax deductions for contributions to organizations that support Israeli settlements on September 21, 2012, in particular saluting the role of the Norwegian People’s Aid and the Norwegian Palestine solidarity movement in bringing about this decision.
The PFLP demanded that other EU states follow in Norway’s footsteps and respect the values of justice, democracy, human rights and international law that they eagerly preach to others while failing to implement themselves.
The Front said that the Norwegian position, in addition to the South African decision to label settlement products have begun the process of isolating the occupation state and undermining the position of the occupation and its strategic ally in Washington.
