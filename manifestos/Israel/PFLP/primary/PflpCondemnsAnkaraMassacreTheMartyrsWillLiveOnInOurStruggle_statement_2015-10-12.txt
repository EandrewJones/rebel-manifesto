We express our deep grief and sorrow to our comrades in Turkey upon the news of the criminal terrorist attack on the march in Ankara for peace and democracy, organized by the labor movement, trade unions and syndicates in Turkey. Over 120 comrades were killed in this attack which wounded hundreds.
We see once again in this attack that the peoples of the region, and at the forefront, the progressive forces and the forces of liberation, are paying the highest price in the ongoing struggle against war and the terrorist policies imposed by imperialism, Zionism, and their agents – the reactionary powers and forces in the region – against our peoples.
At the same time, we also share our grief in the loss of the young Palestinian, Ahmad al-Khaldi from Jabalya in Gaza, who was involved in the demonstration and who was martyred in this horrific aggression. Ahmad fell alongside his fellow martyrs of the peoples of our region, in this march, and confirms once again that the struggle against imperialism, Zionism and their proxy reactionary forces is a common struggle for all of us.
We in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine affirm that the labor movement, the working class and the forces of liberation and progress that came to participate in this march are the best hopes for our people for true peace and democracy. We also send our deepest condolences to the families and the comrades of the martyrs and wish a speedy recovery to the wounded.
The martyrs will live on in our struggle until all of our peoples celebrate the victory of freedom, peace, democracy and justice.
