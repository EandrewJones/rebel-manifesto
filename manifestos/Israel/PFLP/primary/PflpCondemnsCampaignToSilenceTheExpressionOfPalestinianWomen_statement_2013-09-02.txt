The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine expressed its absolute rejection and condemnation of the official coordinated campaign of attack upon the right to demonstrate and freedom to express opinions, targeting and seeking to silence Palestinian women in an attempt to divert attention from the core demand of women, men, and the vast majority of our people to end negotiations immediately, respect the PLO and its decisions, and adopt an alternative to the culture of monopoly, greed, and tampering with the fate of the Palestinian people and their inalienable rights to resist, and defeat the occupation, the settlements, the checkpoints, the wall and win freedom, independence and return.
The Front extended its highest salutes of pride for the valiant Palestinian women and girls who join and lead in the ranks of the national struggle for national rights, democracy, social and economic justice and human rights and against corruption, violation of the national consensus, the patriarchal culture of male dominance, and coercive attempts to keep women suppressed and in darkness under the cover of alleged “protecting morality” and a culture of shame.
The Front said it is important to look at the reasons and the causes of women protesters who used their words to curse in response to the provocations of members of the security forces in civilian clothes who attempted to suppress peaceful demonstrators and violate their rights under law. Further, the Front called upon women’s and human rights organizations to take action to address and expose this unjust ongoing campaign against young Palestinian women active in the movement. We must put an end to this culture of intimidation and violation of public and individual freedoms, expose falsity and provide our people with truth and knowledge.
