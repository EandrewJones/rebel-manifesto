The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine strongly condemned the criminal bombing that targeted a security bus in Tunisia, leading to the martyrdom of a number of innocent people, noting that terror in Tunisia is an extension of the US-Zionist terror in the region.
The Front emphasized that these criminal actions in Tunisia are aimed first against the growing role of the national progressive forces in Tunisia struggling against imperialism, Zionism and reactionary forces and actively confronting normalization with the Zionist enemy.
The Front noted that Tunisian youth, who were historically at the forefront of guerilla struggle for the liberation of Palestine are being pushed deliberately into other battles instead of confronting the Zionist enemy.
The Front emphasized that the means to protect Palestine, Tunisia and the peoples of the region is through more involvement in the revolutionary struggle against the Zionist enemy and confronting US imperialism and its agents in the region.
