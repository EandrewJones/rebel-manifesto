The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) issued a press release rejecting the programme known as “Partnership for Peace” EuropeAid/133-831/L/ACT/PMO, and considered it a European interference in internal Palestinian affairs and an attempt to impose normalization on Palestinians. The programme proposed by the European Union requires a cooperation or partnership between Palestinian, Jordanian and “Israeli” institutions excluding any cooperation or partnership with the Palestinian institutions in the areas of 48 – occupied by the Zionist movement in 1948 – thus, reflecting yet again the suspicious role of these initiatives, which exposes European bias towards the “Israeli” Occupation and US policies which are adapted to the “Israeli” occupation plans, to undermine the rights of the Palestinian people and the Palestinian struggle for freedom and contradicts the fundamental principles of the Palestinian people, including the right of return, self-determination, the independent state and Jerusalem as its capital.
The Front praised institutions in Jerusalem who rejected projects carrying these requirements, and called upon all civil society institutions and political and social forces in the Palestinian occupied homeland and abroad to reject these suspicious projects, and emphasized the responsibility of the PLO leadership to refuse all forms of normalization, security coordination and financial and other forms of corruption that have emerged in certain sectors of Palestinian society.
