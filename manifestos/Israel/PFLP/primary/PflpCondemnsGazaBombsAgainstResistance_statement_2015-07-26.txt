The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine strongly denounces and condemns the bombings that took place on 19 July in the Gaza Strip, which bear the hallmarks of the occupation. The bombings targeted members of the resistance in Gaza City, and exemplify the goals of the occupation to target stability and resistance in the Strip.
The Front called for urgent actions by Palestinians security to capture and prosecute the perpetrators and hold them accountable and bring them to justice, and take all action to prevent these groups from repeating these actions.
The Front reiterated that the Zionist occupation has a major stake in the continuation of these actions in order to tamper with the internal Palestinian front, especially in light of the growing capacity and capability of the resistance and its preparations for any new Zionist aggression, which require the Palestinian internal front to fortify itself against any attempts to undermine it.
