The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine strongly condemned the U.S.- British-French imperialist aggression which targeted Syria with its barbaric missiles on the night of April 13.
This aggression once again exposes the true face of the imperialist states, which claim to praise international law and value human rights. Their aggression comes against a sovereign state with international representation in the United Nations and in violation of international norms and standards. This aggression was premeditated and a deliberate attack that is only dubiously connected to an investigation into the alleged use of chemical weapons to be carried out by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This aggression also comes in the context of achieving the goals and serving the interests of the Zionist entity, reactionary Arab regimes and the violent, reactionary forces they sponsor and finance.
This attack and its objectives will be destroyed on the rock of the steadfastness of the people and state of Syria, with whom we stand in solidarity. We renew our call to all national forces, parties and international organizations that reject this aggression to condemn it and stand by Syria through various actions and popular mobilization.
