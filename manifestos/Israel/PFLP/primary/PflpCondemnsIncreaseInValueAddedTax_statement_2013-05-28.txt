The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine rejected attempts to raise the Value Added Tax in the Palestinian market from 15% to 16%, criticizing the Palestinian Authority’s intention to raise prices starting next June depending on the decision of the ocupation to raise the Value Added Tax, an exercise in submission and surrender to the occupation’s economic measures and the Paris economic Agreement, which has been devastating to Palestinian economic resources and created a deteriorating standard of living for the Palestinian people.
The Front said that such an action is an implementation of the Oslo Accords and its corollaries which have always meant more suffering for the Palestinian people. It called for an end to price increases, which only further impoverish citizens suffering under worsening rates of unemployment, poverty, and extreme poverty, and demanded that social institutions, trade unins, and political groups concerned to mobilize people and protest together to stop this crime against the homeland an the people.
The Front demanded that the leadership of the PLO and the Palestinian Authority declare their refusal to be bound by these agreements and unjust laws devoid of any legitimacy while the occupation continues its settlement project, ethnic cleansing, mass imprisonment, and violence. The economy and security of the Palestinian people must only be provided by our own hands, our own blood, and our own united strength.
