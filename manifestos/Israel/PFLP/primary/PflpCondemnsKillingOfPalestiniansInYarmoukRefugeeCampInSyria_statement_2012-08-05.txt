The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine expressed its strongest condemnation and denunciation of the massacre against our Palestinian people in the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus, Syria on August 3, 2012. The Front said that this is a heinous crime against the Palestinian people in Yarmouk camp, causing over 20 deaths and dozens of injuries among our innocent people.
The Front called upon all forces and stakeholders in Syria to respect the neutrality and security of the Palestinian refugee camps in Syria and Palestinian refugees in all Arab countries, emphasizing the protection of the presence of the Palestinian refugees, their human and legal rights within their host countries and their right to return to their homes from which they were expelle and displaced.
The Front confirmed again the non-interference of our people in the internal affairs of Syria, and said that the massacre of Palestinian people only serves the enemies of the Syrian people, the Arab people, the Palestinian people and all Arabs and Muslims. The Front also reiterated its opposition to Western and other foreign intervention in Syria, saying the destruction of Syria serves their colonial interests in the region.
