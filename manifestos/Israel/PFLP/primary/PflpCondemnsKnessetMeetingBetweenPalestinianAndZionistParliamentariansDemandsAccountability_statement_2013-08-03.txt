The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine described media reports about “the Palestinian flag in the Knesset” as a “theatrical absurdity designed to spread illusions.” Reports about the meeting of a Palestinian delegation with occupation parliamentarians in the Knesset on July 31 are an absurd attempt to promote illusions about the return to negotiations and solutions based on the goals of the US and Israel, which in fact serve only the occupation and its plans, and the US strategy in the region aimed to maximize its control and influence over its people and resources.
The Front condemned this meeting in the Knesset, saying it is an example of the lawlessness and political chaos-mongering employed by the occupation in an attempt to mislead Palestinian and Arab opinion and an attempt to quash the global campaigns of boycott, divestment and sanctions and anti-normalization.
Further, said the Front, this is an attempt to hide settlement expansion, the Judaization of Jerusalem, and the crimes against Palestinian land and rights, and the denial of the inalienable rights of our people to freedom, independence and return.
The Martyr Abu Ali Mustafa List, called for the Palestinian Legislative Council and the masses of the Fateh movement to hold accountable those parliamentarians who attended the Knesset meeting with Zionist parliamentarians. In particular, they denounced the participation of Fateh parliamentarian, and chair of the PLC’s Political Committee, Abdullah Abdullah, at the head of the delegation to these absurd normalization meetings, which should instead be condemned and rejected.
The list’s statement said that in light of the growing popular and official isolation of the occupation on the international scene, it is particularly reckless for a group of Palestinian leaders to hold another useless meeting, this time with Zionist parliamentarians, which threatens again a new series of concessions and a rejection of the national and popular consensus. They called upon all parliamentary blocs in the Legislative Council to condemn and reject these normalization meetings, and instead to work to organize initiatives to expose, boycott and isolate the Zionist entity at all levels, including holding accountable and exposing those who normalize with the occupation.
