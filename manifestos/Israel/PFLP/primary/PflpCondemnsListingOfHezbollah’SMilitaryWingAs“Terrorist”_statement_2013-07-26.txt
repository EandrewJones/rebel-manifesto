The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine strongly condemns the European Union’s decision to list the military wing of Hezbollah on the so-called “terrorist list.” The PFLP said that this decision, like other previous acts hostile to our nation and our valiant and legitimate resistance that humiliated the Zionist enemy, was the result of US pressure in defense of the interests of the Zionist entity.
This action, the Front said, provides protection and cover to the daily crimes committed against the Arab nation and the Palestinian people. This decision also supports the aggressive intentions, and alliance with, the Zionist enemy, which continues its assault upon the Arab and Palestinian people.
The Front said that the people of Europe will soon stand up against this dependence and subservience to US demands and this scandalous bias in favour of the Zionist entity. European popular solidarity with the Arab and Palestinian people and standing against the Zionist occupation is growing. The Front also saluted the heroic Lebanese resistance and its historic victories over Zionist invasions.
