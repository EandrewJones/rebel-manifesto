The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine condemned the meetings with the head of the occupation state Shimon Peres in Jordan at the World Economic Forum, saying that such meetings are exercises in normalization, which is being promoted on a global and Arab level at the WEF.
The Front said that such meetings are a goal of the occupation, in its attempt to define the head of the occupation state as a “peacemaker,” while everyone knows that he does not define or decide Israeli policy, and is nothing more than a marketing policy of the government of settlements and war who attempts to deceive the public with talk about “peace” and the so-called “two-state solution,” while the Judaization of Jerusalem and the settlement-building project are in full swing, and international human rights and humanitarian law are violated daily.
The Front demanded an end to any form of normalization, bilateral meetings, “negotiations,” and US-brokered “solutions” and instead demand implementation of Palestinian rights and international law to put an end to occupation and enforce Palestinian rights to return and self-determination.
