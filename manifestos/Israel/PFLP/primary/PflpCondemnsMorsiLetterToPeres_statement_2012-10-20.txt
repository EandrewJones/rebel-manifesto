The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine expressed its deep disapproval to the letter sent on behalf of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi to the president of the occupation state, noting that the attitudes expressed therein do not reflect the position or the enormous sacrifices of the Egyptian and Arab peoples, nor do they reflect Shimon Peresâ€™ long history of aggression, war, and racist oppression against the Palestinian people, their land, their rights, and the Arab and Muslim peoples as a whole.
The PFLP said that this letter provoked feelings of shock and frustration in the Palestinian street, which is relying on Egyptian and Arab support for the national cause and for an end to policies that strengthen the occupation state.
