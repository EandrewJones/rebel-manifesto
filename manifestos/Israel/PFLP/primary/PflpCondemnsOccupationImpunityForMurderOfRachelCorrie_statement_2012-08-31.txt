The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine condemned the decision of the Zionist occupation court that acquitted the occupation army of all responsibility in its murder of American solidarity activist Rachel Corrie, who was crushed by an occupation bulldozer in southern Gaza in 2003 as she was defending a Palestinian home from demolition.
The Front noted that this court action, absolving Israeli soldiers in the deliberate killing of Corrie, along with the closing of the file of the massacre of the Samouni family in Gaza, provide yet more evidence that the occupation’s legal system is simply a massive deception that is part and parel of the aggression of the occupation against our people and those who stand in solidarity with our just cause.
The Front said that this decision confirms that the occupation regime, army and judiciary are institutions based on one policy, seeking to justify the crimes of the occupation.
The Front demanded that the international community and human rights organizations take up their role to hold the occupation power accountable for its numerous crimes against the Palestinian people as a rogue state outside the law, and try the killers of Corrie and thousands of our people. The Front also called upon international solidarity activists to continue their work to expose the crimes of the occupation and continue their valiant efforts to hold Zionist war criminals accountable.
