The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine condemned the occupation army’s cold-blooded murder of three Palestinians in Yatta, al-Khalil under a flimsy pretext and demanded that Palestinian Authority officials stop their concessions and continuation of the so-called negotiations that serve to cover up this crime.
Moussa Mohammad Moussa Makhamra, Mahmoud Khalid al-Najjar, and Mohammad Fouad Jamil Nairoukh were killed by occupation forces on November 26. The ongoing crimes of the occupation continue, paid for in Palestinian blood, while the Authority attempts to silence the voices and infringe the rights of freedom of expression of the Palestinian people, said the Front. This war crime is an escalation in the ongoing war crimes against the land, rights, and people of Palestine that are taking place without restraint. The Front demanded that the United Nations and international bodies hold the occupation accountable for their crimes.
The Front said that the path forward is that of unity and resistance to the occupation.
