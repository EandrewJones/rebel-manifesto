The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the remarks of Majed Faraj, director of intelligence in the Palestinian Authority in “Defense News,” in which he claimed responsibility for the PA stopping 200 resistance actions and arresting 100 Palestinian activists during the uprising.
Comrade Abdul-Alim Da’na said that the role of security coordination is to attempt to contain the popular intifada and its confrontation of the occupation. He noted that there is nothing new about security coordination, saying that it has not stopped for even one day.
Comrade Mahmoud al-Ras said that the interview and its claims were shameful, indicating that the PA security apparatus is acting as a “gun for hire that protects the security of armed settlers that attack our children under the noses of these security forces and their leaders, who coordinate with the occupation and boast of frustrating hundreds of resistance action,” noting that these security forces did not stop or thwart settler attacks or protect the Palestinian people.
Further, the Front joined with the Islamic Jihad Movement and Hamas in issuing a statement of severe condemnation of Faraj’s statements, noting that they “came in the context of terror and extremism afflicting our region and the world, so that these statements also constituted an extreme insult to the march of our people, their struggles and sacrifices, and at the same time promote national division.”
The three organizations noted that “these statements reflect the Authority’s insistence on the continuation of security coordination, and more seriously, equate the resistance of our people against occupation and their struggle with terrorism, which we reject…We reaffirm our rejection of the involvement of Palestine, its cause and its people in a game of axes and alliances under the banner of ‘fighting terrorism.’ It must always be noted that the sponsor of the Zionist terrorism against our people is the same U.S. administration that provides [the Authority] with these positions that do not reflect the concerns and aspirations of the Palestinian people.”
