Comrade Abu Nidal Toman, member of the Central Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, condemned the assault on Hamas movement leader Hassan Youssef in Ramallah by Palestinian Authority security forces, during a march supporting the Palestinian prisoners on hunger strike.
“This attack is unacceptable and undermines the efforts in solidarity with the Palestinian prisoners on hunger strike, who are struggling to preserve and uphold the national dignity of the Palestinian people,” said Toman.
The Democratic Rally of Journalists also denounced PA security forces’ attack on journalists and reporters during a sit-in at Manara Square in central Ramallah called by the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate to denounce attacks on press freedom in Gaza and the West Bank.
Security services “arrested a number of journalists, smashed their equipment, confiscated cameras and severely beat others who were hospitalized for their injuries,” while plainclothes security forces threatened journalists and attempted to take their cameras.
The Palestinian Authority is engaged in security coordination with the occupation state, which the Front has repeatedly denounced as a crime against the Palestinian people and their resistance which must end, and the PA security forces are funded and trained by the United States, Canada and the European Union to ensure they serve as mechanisms for repression of the Palestinian people rather than as a form of defense or security against the continuous attacks of occupation soldiers and settlers.
