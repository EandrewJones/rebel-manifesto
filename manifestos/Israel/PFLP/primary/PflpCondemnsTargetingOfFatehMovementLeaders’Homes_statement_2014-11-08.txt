The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine strongly condemned the targeting of the cars and homes of multiple leaders of the Fateh movement in Gaza in the morning of November 7, and the platform for the upcoming rally in memory of Yasser Arafat, saying that this is a dangerous development that tends to redirect the Palestinian struggle from the primary conflict with the Zionist enemy.
The Front called on all forces to uphold their responsibilities in upholding Palestinian unity and addressing these criminal acts. Furthermore, the Front called for “cutting the road” to the underlying objectives, including mobilizing the Palestinian arena for resistance to the Zionist aggressive projects that are escalating in Jerusalem and all of Palestine.
The Front also called on the security forces in Gaza to act quickly and thoroughly to uncover the perpetrators and hold them accountable.
In addition, the Front held a meeting of the National and Islamic Forces, including both Fateh and Hamas, at its office in Gaza City, which formed a national committee to follow the course of the investigation and the prosecution and trial of the perpetrators. It also urged the national reconciliation government to convene in Gaza as scheduled.
