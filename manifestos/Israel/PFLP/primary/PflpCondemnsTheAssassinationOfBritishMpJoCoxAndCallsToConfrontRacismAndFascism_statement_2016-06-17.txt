The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine condemned the assassination of the British Labour MP Jo Cox at the hands of a British racist extremist, emphasizing the need to address the racist discourse of colonial powers, and to confront the growing threat of fascism and the extreme right in Europe and around the world.
The PFLP considers that the attack on MP Jo Cox, a supporter of Palestinian rights, and other progressive voices, as well as repeated attacks on refugee centers in Germany and elsewhere in Europe, are not isolated incidents or mere security concerns, but rather reflect an intensified state of extreme right ideology and sharp polarization in the industrialized Western societies. The Front urges Palestinian and Arab communities to build broad alliances to confront these crimes and defend the people against attack.
The Front declared that the world capitalist system, led by the United States as the center of imperialism, is responsible for the rising manifestations of fascism in Europe. Capitalism and imperialism destroy communities, peoples and countries, and create millions of refugees and migrants from among the displaced popular classes, and then these same systems encourage a racist offensive and represses those who defend their human and natural rights.
The PFLP said that there is no difference between the racist criminal who killed MP Jo Cox and the Zionist criminal who ran over and killed the struggling American martyr for Palestine, Rachel Corrie, in Gaza in March 2003.
