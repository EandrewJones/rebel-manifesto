The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine condemned US and Western threats and aggression against Syria, denouncing these countriesâ€™ threats to wage an illegal war and exacerbate the explosive situation in the region. The US is threatening severe harm to the Syrian people and the Arab people, through a lengthy conflict that threatens its future, the sovereignty and unity and its territory, that will benefit no one but warmongers and predators of neocolonialism, domination and occupation in perpetuating the enslavement of the region, its peoples and its wealth.
The Front rejected the Zionist and imperialist aggression and external intervention in all forms and warned against the crocodile tears of the forces of war and aggression against the Syrian and Arab people, who are doing all they can to prevent a political solution that can save the people and the nation and stop the bloodshed in Syria, The same forces provide their utmost support to the occupation of Palestine and the torture of its people for over a century. The Front warned of the role of the Arab League or some Arab or Muslim states being used by the advocates of war and aggression in an attempt to provide cover for this dirty war.
The people of the region and their children will be the ones who pay for it, again and again.
