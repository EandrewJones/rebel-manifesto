The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine strongly condemns the brutal Zionist aggression against the correspondent of Al-Mayadeen TV channel, Hana Mahameed, in occupied Jerusalem, which led to her injury and treatment in hospital.
The Front notes that this criminal attack on journalists covering events in the city of Jerusalem is a continuous Zionist practice targeting journalists, in order to intimidate them and presure them to stop the media coverage and exposure of the details of the ongoing crimes being committed in Jerusalem.
The Front demanded that international institutions concerned with the rights of journalists assume their responsibility to condemn the crimes of the occupation and its systematic targeting of journalists, and to take all necessary measures to protect journalists.
