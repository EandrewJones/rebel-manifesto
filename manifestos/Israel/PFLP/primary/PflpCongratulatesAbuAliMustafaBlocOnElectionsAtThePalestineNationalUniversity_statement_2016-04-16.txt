The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine extends its sincere congratulations to the students at Palestine National University in Bethlehem on the democratic elections for the Student Union, marked by honest competition between the student blocs.
In particular, the PFLP congratulates the comrades of the Martyr Abu Ali Mustafa Bloc for winning 10 seats in the election; this compares to 20 seats won by the Martyr Yasser Arafat Alliance Bloc, which includes the Fateh students and supporters of the DFLP and the Peoples Party. This is one more seat than the Abu Ali Mustafa Bloc won last year. In addition, the bloc of the National Initiative won three seats.
The progress of the Abu Ali Mustafa Bloc demonstrates their successful campaign and programs and their commitment to express the convictions of the students and their vision of a liberated Palestine, and their work to protect the rights of the students and support their campaign for free education.
The PFLP salutes all of the comrades of the Bloc who contributed to this progress.
