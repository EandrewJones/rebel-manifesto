The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine congratulates the Palestinian people, the village of Asira al-Shamaliyah and the Kayed family on the liberation of Comrade Bilal Kayed from Israeli jails. After over 15 years in Israeli jails and after 71 days in the battle of empty stomachs in protest at being ordered to administrative detention without charge or trial after completing his sentence, he achieved his liberation despite the tyranny of occupation and their continued attempts to renew his detention and isolation.
The Front emphasized the achievements of Comrade Bilal Kayed in steadfastness, determination, and high morale in struggle and revolutionary consciousness, affirming that his victory is one for the entire Palestinian people and the prisoners’ movement that will only strengthen the prisoners’ spirit of confrontation against the jailer and its tools of repression.
The Front also salutes the Prison Branch of the organization, headed by imprisoned General Secretary Comrade Ahmad Sa’adat, who entered the battle alongside Bilal Kayed from the first moment with an integrated program of struggle and a collective campaign, fighting side by side with Comrade Kayed in the battle of empty stomachs.
The Front praised Comrade Kayed as an inspiration to the masses of the Palestinian people, who thwarted the schemes to remove him outside the homeland or or force him into administrative detention, renewed again and again, isolated in his cell.
The Front noted that the battle of Comrade Bilal Kayed and the achievement of his freedom is far from the last of the battles of will waged by the prisoners in Israeli jails. The battle with the occupation prison administration and intelligence is ongoing and continuous, and requires from the masses of our people to strengthen the struggle with the prisoners’ movement, activating all means of support, including the expansion of popular and international solidarity in support of administrative detainees on hunger strike for over 75 days, Anas Shadid and Ahmad Abu Fara, as well as Ammar Hmour. It is critically important to document their experiences of struggle and the violations of the occupation and work to hold its war criminals accountable at the International Criminal Court.
