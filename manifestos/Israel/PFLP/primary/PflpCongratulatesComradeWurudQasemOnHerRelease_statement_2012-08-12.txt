Comrade Wurud Qasem of the town of Tira in the Southern Triangle was released by Zionist occupation forces on Thursday, August 9, after spending six years in occupation prisons. She was received by a large number of family, relatives, and national figures who welcomed her home to al-Tira. Her release came after approval of a so-called early medical release by the courts, only two months before the scheduled end of her sentence in October. It should also be noted that the occupation authorities flatly refused to release comrade Qasem during the recent prisoner exchange.
As she returned home, she said that “my joy will not be complete until the release of all prisoners in the jails of the occupation, who continue to suffer.” She thanked all who stood with her and supported her over the years.
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine congratulates comrade Wurud Qasem, and her family, the town of al-Tira, our people in occupied Palestine 1948, and all of our people in the homeland and in exile and diaspora, on the occasion of her freedom. The Front praised Qasem’s steadfastness during her 6 years of captivity, suffering and physical and psychological torture. Her steadfastness was evident recently in the battle of empty stomachs recently, where she joined in hunger strike despite her serious medical difficulties. The Front joined her in the hope and demand that the joy of the Palestinian people will be complete with the release of all prisoners and detainees in the prisons of the occupation.
