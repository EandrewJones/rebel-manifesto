The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine joins the Palestinian people in congratulating and welcoming Mahmoud Sarsak, the Palestinian athlete and struggler, upon his liberation from the prisons of the occupation after his victory in the “Battle of Empty Stomachs,” recording the longest open-ended hunger strike – 96 days – in the history of the Palestinian prisoners’ movement.
Mahmoud Sarsak is a Palestinian football player who had been held for over 3 years by the occupation with no charge or trial. The PFLP said that Sarsak’s freedom is a victory against the tyranny of the occupation, grabbing freedom from the claws of the occupation, and a new victory for the prisoners’ movement over the Zionist wardens. This victory is part and parcel of the sacrifices and struggles of the prisoners’ movement that continue until this day, said the Front, calling for all campaigns of solidarity and support for the prisoners in the jails of the occupation to continue, particularly for those who continue their hunger strikes, including Akram al-Rikhawi, Samer al-Barq and Hassan Safadi.
