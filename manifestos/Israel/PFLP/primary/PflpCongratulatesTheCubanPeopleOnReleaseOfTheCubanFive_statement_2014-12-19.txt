The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine congratulates the Cuban people; Gerardo Hernández, Ramón Labañino and Antonio Guerrero; their families and comrades on the release of the remaining imprisoned members of the Cuban Five.
The Cuban Five, Cuban political prisoners held in U.S. prisons, were an international symbol of the struggle of the Cuban people to be free of the attacks of U.S. imperialism. They were arrested and imprisoned for lengthy sentences for seeking to defend Cuba and the Cuban revolution from right-wing terrorist organizations based in the United States carrying out attacks on Cuba. They have been at the center of a global struggle demanding the release of these political prisoners, symbols of the Cuban revolution.
On December 17, Gerardo, Ramon and Antonio returned home, free, to Cuba. We salute them, and their earlier-freed compatriots, Rene Gonzalez and Fernando Gonzalez, on their steadfastness in imperialist prisons and their liberation, and we salute the Cuban people and the Cuban revolution for their ongoing and determined commitment to stand with oppressed peoples and nations around the world who struggle for liberation, including the Palestinian people.
Comrades Maher al-Taher and Abu Ali Hassan have just returned from a delegation to Cuba, where they, along with Comrade Basil Ismail, the Front’s representative in Cuba, met with the Communist Party of Cuba, its International Relations Committee, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Parliament. In these meetings, Jose Ramon Balaguer Cabrera, chair of the International Relations Committee of the Party, expressed the commitment of Cuba and the longtime support of the Cuban nation for the full national rights of the Palestinian people, and the right of return of Palestinian refugees to their original homes nad lands at the forefront.
