The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine congratulates the Palestinian people and the freed prisoner Khader Adnan and his family today, as he won his liberation from the Zionist prisons after a battle of over 55 days on open hunger strike.
The Front considers that the achievement of Khader Adnan is a victory in every sense of the word, and was achieved through determination, will and steadfastness, a brilliant example of our people.
Khader Adnan’s victory over the jailer underlines the fact that we can defeat the occupier with our will, steadfastness, commitment and detemination to achieve our goals no matter the sacrifice necessary.
Khader Adnan’s battle and victory over the occupation is part of an open and ongoing struggle with the occupier, fought by all of our brave prisoners on a daily basis, that requires official and popular support at all levels.
