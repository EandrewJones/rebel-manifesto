The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine participated in “Todos Somos Venezuela,” an international conference convened in Caracas to defend the Bolivarian Revolution and Venezuela against escalating attacks of U.S. imperialism and reactionary forces.
Comrade Maher al-Taher, member of the Political Bureau of the PFLP and Comrade Ishaq Abu al-Walid, the representative of the Front in Venezuela, participated in the conference, which brought together 196 participants from 65 countries and five continents.
During the conference, the PFLP delegation held meetings with the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Cuban delegation and the delegation of the Philippines. The PFLP delegation also met with the Venezuelan Ministers of Defense and Supply.
Comrade Taher emphasized the “support of the Palestinian people and the Popular Front alongside the Venezuelan people, their revolution and their government in defense of themselves and their homeland. The battle of Venezuela is our battle as well against Zionism and imperialism, and we stand with you in the same trench.”
The PFLP delegation also participated in a meeting with the Venezuelan Communist Party, including its General Secretary, Oscar Figuera, together with Comrade Jamil Safieh of the Lebanese Communist Party. Taher will also meet with the Palestinian and Arab communities in Venezuela.
Delcy Rodriguez, the president of Venezuela’s Constituent Assembly, expressed her support for Palestine at the festival, emphasizing to the Palestinian delegation that “We are with you and your heroic struggle until you achieve your full aspirations.”
