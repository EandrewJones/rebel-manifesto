On the tenth anniversary of the abduction of General Secretary Ahmad Sa’adat by Palestinian Authority security services, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine demanded that the Palestinian Authority end its role as a burden on the Palestinian people and instead suppport the Palestinian people and their steadfastness. The PFLP also called for a rally in Ramallah on January 21, 2012 at the Cultural Palace in Ramallah to mark the anniversary and raise the banner of freedom for Ahmad Sa’adat and his comrades.
The PA abducted General Secretary Sa’adat on January 15, 2002 following the assassination of the notorious racist Israeli tourism minister and head of the Moledet party, Rehavam Ze’evi, by PFLP fighters in retaliation for the assassination of PFLP General Secretary Abu Ali Mustafa on August 29, 2001; the abduction came at the behest of Israel and the US.
In a statement on the anniversary, the Front said that this painful anniversary illustrates the extent of the use of Palestinian security agencies and the agencies of the Authority in policies and practices that undermine and directly attack the steadfastness and resistance of the Palestinian people. These actions come under the auspices of the Oslo agreement, which was designed to divide the Palestinian people, disrupt their national liberation movement, undermine Palestinian national rights guaranteed by international law, and strengthen normalization with the occupation, which the Palestinian and Arab people have steadfastly resisted for the past decades.
The Front demanded that the Palestinian Authority assume the political, security and moral responsibility for the abduction of Sa’adat, his comrades, and Fouad Shobaki, noting the complicity of the US and British governments with the occupation, undermine the rights guaranteed by international legitimacy, saying that the responsibility for the arrest of Sa’adat and his comrades lies with the Authority. The Front noted that Ahmad Sa’adat is now in isolation for the third consecutive year, is deprived of family visits, needed medical care, and the most basic political and human rights guaranteed by international human rights and humanitarian law.
