The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine demanded an independent investigation into the events at Askar refugee camp, which claimed the life of Amjad Odeh, 37, killed by a bullet of Palestinian Authority security services. The PFLP called upon the national factions and human rights organizations to act urgently to end these violations and hold the security services of the Authority accountable under the law.
The Front said that the repeated incidence of such violations and so-called investigations into the security services which produce no result is a serious problem, and requires judicial intervention and a fair and responsible investigation. Official stakeholders and popular movements must impose the obligation to implement the law and take action to deter such violations and hold those accountable who violate the law and the people.
Such actions undermine national steadfastness and serve only the occupation and schemes which seek to liquidate the Palestinian people and their just cause.
