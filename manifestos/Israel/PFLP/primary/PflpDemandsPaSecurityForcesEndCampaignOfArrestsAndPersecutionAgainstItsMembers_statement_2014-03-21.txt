The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in the West Bank demanded the Palestinian Authority security apparatus and its intelligence services immediately halt the campaign of arrests and persecution of its supporters and members in various parts of the West Bank on March 20. Specifically, the PFLP statement pointed to al-Azza refugee camp, where 5 PFLP supporters were arrested, dozens of homes raided, and 5 others being pursued by PA security forces.
The PFLP denounced the Authority’s security forces’ campaign against a Palestinian national faction that is targeted by the Zionist occupation, which is increasing its aggression against our people everywhere, including targeting our comrades with murder and mass arrests.
The PFLP demanded that the PA end security coordination with the occupation, which has been a scourge upon our people, including the arrests of many honourable activists. It recalled that the past days have seen several occasions in which the Zionist occupation has arrested Palestinian activists and freedom fighters hours after they were released by the PA security apparatus.
The Front demanded that the PA must learn that these practices are rejected by the Palestinian people. It is the proper task of any Palestinian security force to protect our people, their activists and their freedom fighters and not become a whip to lash at the rising of their own people and their activists.
