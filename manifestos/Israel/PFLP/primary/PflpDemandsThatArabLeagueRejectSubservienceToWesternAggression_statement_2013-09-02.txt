The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine demanded that Arab foreign ministers, meeting today at the Arab League headquarters in the Egyptian capital of Cairo today, show respect for the dignity of their people and their interests and end their subservience to foreign aggressive plans against the Arab peoples.
Today, U.S. and Western aggression against Syria and its people is threatened and the Arab League is sought to provide cover for the U.S. battleships who are preparing to fling death and destruction on the Syrian people and their homeland in a sea of destruction and bloodshed, under false slogans of democracy and human rights. These slogans are being employed to justify premeditated and criminal targeting along the lines of what happened in the lead-up to the war on Iraq, which continues to suffer due to killing, fragmentation and destruction.
The Front confirmed that it is part of the firm Palestinian consensus that rejects the threats and aggression of the U.S. and the West, warning that the policies of alliance of some Gulf countries, which recall the axis of the days of the Baghdad Pact, aim to provide cover for the schemes of the occupation and its strategic allies in building what they call the “Greater Middle East” on the ruins of the Arab nation as a central cause, while the so-called Jewish state rests atop a throne of qualitative military superiority and advantage.
