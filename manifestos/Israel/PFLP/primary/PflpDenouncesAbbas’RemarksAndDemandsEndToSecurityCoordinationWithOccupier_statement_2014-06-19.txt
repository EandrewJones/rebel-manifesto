While the Zionist occupation forces are brutally attacking Palestinians in their alleged search for missing settlers, and while they are threatening to deport hundreds of activists and hunger striking prisoners to Gaza, arresting more than 50 released prisoners in the Wafa al-Ahrar agreement, Palestinian Authority President Abu Mazen praised security coordination with the occupation and denounced Palestinian resistance at a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. These remarks were a slap in the face to the Palestinian people while they are confronting Israeli terror in the West Bank, said the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The security coordination has been highly damaging to the resistance and its forces and benefitted only the enemy and the settlers, and the Authority’s commitment to security coordination is part of the attack on the Palestinian people.
To those who defend security coordination, the Front asks, how many times has security coordination been used to prevent settler attacks against Palestinian land and people, which happen constantly in all parts of the West Bank? How many times has it prevented occupation forces from invading towns and villages, arresting Palestinians or demolishing homes, how many times has it prevented settlers from invading al-Aqsa Mosque? It has done nothing to protect Palestinians and is a direct service to the occupation and its interests, said the Front.
The PFLP deplores and completely rejects Abu Mazen’s statements on security coordination and demands the Executive Committee of the PLO act responsibly to end security coordination once and for all and to end the negotiations which only benefit the enemy and the Zionist project in Palestine.
