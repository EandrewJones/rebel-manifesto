The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the planned meeting in Amman between PLO representatives and the occupation state on Monday, January 2, 2012, saying that holding direct meetings with the occupation state while the issue should be in the hands of the United Nations is unacceptable. The Front said that such negotiations are dangerous and only “encourage the occupation in its policies to attack our people, land, and holy sites, and to encourage the Arab, Islamic and international parties to evade their ethical, legal and politial responsibilities.”
The meeting is planned to take place between Saeb Erekat and Israeli official Yitzhak Molcho on Tuesday, January 3.
In fact, said the Front, the only beneficiaries of this meeting are the occupation and the Quartet. The Quartet and its representative Tony Blair are illegitimate authorities and have no right to place conditions upon the Palestinian people, and are rejected by the Palestinian people as a reference point. Such meetings and negotiations, the Front emphasized, undermine the Palestinian national struggle and revive, once again, illusions, dependency, and appeasement, avoiding facing the bloody reality imposed by the occupation tghrough settlements, ethnic cleansing, siege and aggression.
Furthermore, such negotiations directly undermine any drive toward Palestinian national unity, as Palestinian national unity must be built around a united plan to confront the occupation, and on a basis of no negotiations with the occupier.
