The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine declared that the Palestinian Authority and the leaders of its security services are responsible for the blatant and brutal assault on demonstrators as they protested against the continuing trial of the martyr, Basil al-Araj and his comrades, and demanded the immediate and unconditional release of all detainees.
The Front noted that the PA security apparatus attacked peaceful protesters in Ramallah with tear gas, sound bombs, pepper spray and batons, injuring and arresting many including the father of the martyr Basil al-Araj, who was transferred to the hospital for treatment. This is an unforgivable crime and those who gave the orders and carried them out must be held accountable.
The Front urged the importance of a national and decisive stand to confront this escalation against the Palestinian people, shamelessly repeated more than once, which utterly disregards the value and symbolism of the martyrs to the Palestinian people with the farcical trial today in Ramallah and even a physical assault on the martyrâ€™s father.
The PFLP emphasized that the Palestinian Authority must end these shameful practices, both the continuation of security coordination and the repression of demonstrators. The Palestinian leadership has a choice: to either stand with the pulse of the Palestinian people and uphold the beliefs and principles of the liberation movement, especially the resistance and the right to democratice protest, or to be a repressive authority shunned by all sectors of the Palestinian people.
