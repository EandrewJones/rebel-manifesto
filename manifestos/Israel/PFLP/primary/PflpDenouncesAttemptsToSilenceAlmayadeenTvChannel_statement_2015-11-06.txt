The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine expressed its solidarity with Al-Mayadeen satellite channel, strongly condemning the actions of the Arabsat company and its sponsors threatening to stop its broadcast over the Arabsat satellite, saying that this is a political action attempting to silence the voice of the resistance and the interests and issues of the peoples, including the Palestinian people, who recognize the status and value of Al-Mayadeen channel in their struggle, exposing the crimes of the Zionist enemy.
The Front emphasized that the decision to silence the broadcast of Al-Mayadeen cannot be understood except in the context of the participation of Arab officials, parties and states in schemes hostile to the interests of the people of the Arab nation, and therefore calls upon all of the forces of the Arab liberation movement to stand in solidarity and defense of Al-Mayadeen as a defense of the issues and interests of our peoples.
The Front has great confidence that Al-Mayadeen channel will be able to withstand these pressures and will maintain its policy of publicizing the struggles of the liberation movements not only in our region but in all parts of the world, as is expressed particularly in its coverage and communication with the peoples and movements of Latin America.
