The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the election of “Israel” to the presidency of the United Nations Legal Committee, amid globalized imperialist domination and its alliance with the Zionist movement, and amid the Arab conditions of unprecedented sectarian conflicts, disintegration and dependency, and the cooperation, normalization and coordination with the enemy on the part of reactionary Arab states.
The Front notes that this decision is an attack on any concept of international law or justice, encouraging and rewarding a state that openly violates the UN Charter and all forms of international humanitarian and human rights law, and even attacks the UN in order to perptuate its occupation of Palestine, with a racist and fascist nature and policy, and rejecting outright all international decisions and resolutions on the rights of the Palestinian people to return, self-determination and independence.
The Front concluded that this action is a reward for the Zionist state and its attacks on the Palestinian people, and that its election to the presidency of the UN Legal Committee will be used to commit more crimes against the Palestinian people, more violations of international law, and the continued occupation of Palestine and other Arab lands.
