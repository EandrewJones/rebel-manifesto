Comrade Jamil Mizher, member of the political bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, strongly condemned the United Stattes’ FBI’s inclusion of the name of the General Secretary of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, Dr. Ramadan Abdallah Shallah, on its “most-wanted list.”
“The United States of America is the head of evil and the center of terror in the world. Its leaders, officials and generals must be brought before international tribunals for the crimes they have committed against the world and humanity,” Mizher said, noting that “the U.S. government is the last that should speak about human rights and the fight against terror. Its history is full of massacres and the bloodshed of women, children and elders, and its crimes are notorious against the Palestinian people and the peoples of the region.”
He emphasized that the Front stands with Dr. Shallah and the brothers in the Islamic Jihad movement, saying that the Front and all of the resistance factions and every free national voice are together in the struggle.
