The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the horrific criminal bombings in Bourj al-Barajneh, in southern Beirut on Thursday evening, which killed dozens and injured hundreds in a working-class neighborhood that has always been a home of dignity and resistance. Comrade Abu Ahmad Fuad, the Deputy General Secretary of the PFLP, sent his sincere condolences to the Lebanese people and to the Lebanese resistance in the face of this crime.
In an interview on Al-Mayadeen TV, Fuad said that the massacre bears the hallmarks of the Mossad and its tools that seek to weaken the resistance and divide the people, particularly in light of recent events in Lebanon and Syria, and in the context of the growing intifada in Palestine, which is turning the eyes and the hearts of the region once again to the central issue of Palestine. “This massacre also comes immediately following the exposure of Zionist espionage networks in Lebanon,” noted Fuad. He asserted his strongest confidence in the Lebanese people and the Lebanese resistance to overcome the Zionist criminals and the murderous extremist takfiri attacks.
The PFLP in Lebanon also saluted the strength of the Lebanese people and the Palestinian people in the camps, standing together, donating blood, and demanding justice for this mass murder, mourning the martyrs, wishing a speedy recovery for the wounded, concluding by saying that “the people of Lebanon will be victorious.”
