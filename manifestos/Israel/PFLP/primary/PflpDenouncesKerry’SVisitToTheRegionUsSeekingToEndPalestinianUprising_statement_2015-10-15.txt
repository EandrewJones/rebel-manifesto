The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine called upon the Palestinian leadership to beware the objectives of the upcoming visit of US Secretary of State John Kerry to the region, demanding that they reject any attempts to pressure the Palestinian people to end their mass resistance to the occupation; the Front called upon the Palestinian people to raise their voices in condemnation of the United States role and position and to escalate their resistance in all forms to coincide with his visit.
The Front said that Kerry and the US administration have no goal other than to provide support to and save its strategic ally, the Zionist occupier, and to pressure the Palestinian side at the expense of the Palestinian rights, noting that the purpose of this visit and that of the so-called Quartet is to stop the escalating intifada.
“The United States presents a strong barrier in front of our people and our rights in all international forums, and uses the veto as a weapon wielded dozens of times to prevent our people from exercising their right to self-determination,” said the Front. “The United States was and still is the head of the snake which spreads poison and sectarian wars to the Arab nation.”
Further, the Front noted, the United States is a key partner and participant in all of the massacres carried out by the occupier in all of its wars and attacks against the Palestinian people.
