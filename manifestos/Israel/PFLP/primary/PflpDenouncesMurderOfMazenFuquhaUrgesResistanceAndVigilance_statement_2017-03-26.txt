The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the murder of the freed prisoner deported to Gaza, Mazen Fuquha, as a cowardly crime of the Zionist state which requires a deterrent response from the resistance, including holding accountable the perpetrators of this crime.
The Front expressed its sincere condolences to the brothers in the resistance and the Islamic movement’s military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, on the martyrdom of this freedom fighter who remained steadfast in the resistance even after his liberation from Israeli jails.
The Front urged the masses of the Palestinian people and friends and supporters to participate widely in marking the funeral of the martyr, confirming that the option of resistance remains open and present and directed toward freedom and national liberation to confront the crimes of the occupation, and to deliver a clear message to the occupation that assassinations against the resistance and its leaders will backfire like volcanoes in the face of the occupying force and will never suppress our people’s and our resistance’s determination to continue the resistance and the intifada.
The Front views this cowardly crime of assassination of a freed prisoner from the Wafa al-Ahrar exchange as a dangerous Zionist escalation. The resistance factions should be aware of its implications and timing, to draw lessons in order to be able to respond to the magnitude of this crime and to intensify its efforts to reach the collaborators and killers who carried out this crime and reinforce its actions on the home front.
The Front called upon the resistance factions to be vigilant and take all appropriate measures to protect the fighters and strugglers. The occupation is always ready to commit more such bloody crimes, especially against freed prisoners in this cowardly manner.
