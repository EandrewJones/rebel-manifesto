The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine strongly condemned the meeting between Prince Turki al-Faisal, former director of Saudi intelligence and former Israeli national security advisor Gen. Yaakov Amidor in Washington, DC in a public forum hosted by Zionist lobby organization Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
This meeting is clearly part of a Saudi process of normalization with the Zionist state with the full approval of the Saudi Royal Palace. These meetings and seminars are part of examining bilateral cooperation to manage the bloody wars on Yemen, Syria and Iraq, and in stoking sectarian conflict in these countries and the region.
The Front also said that references to the so-called “Arab Peace Initiative” as a condition for normal relations with the occupation state are nothing but an attempt to obscure reality, especially as Saudi Arabia is well aware that the policies of the Netanyahu government – as those who preceded it – do not brook this initiative, and yet continues openly with cooperation and normalization.
The Front urged the Arab peoples to unite to confront normalization with the occupier, noting that the Tel Aviv government has secret and semi-secret relations with numerous Arab states, especially the Gulf countries.
