The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine condemned the Zionist state’s attack on the Palestine Today satellite channel and expressed its full solidarity with the channel after occupation forces invaded the station at dawn, arrested its director and some individual workers, emphasizing that this targeting of journalists and media institutions is a desperate attempt by the occupation to silence the truth.
The Front declared that the adoption of the Zionist security mini-cabinet of new decisins reflects its inability to cope with the momentum of the growing intifada, including its decision to target satellite channels and Palestinian media under the pretext of “stopping incitement.” This reflects their state of confusion as they attempt to stop the intifada, during which various journalistic methods are only growing in exposing the truth of the crimes of the occupation and the injustice done to the Palestinian people.
The Front praised the heroic role of Palestinian journalists and media workers in transmitting a truthful picture of what is happening in occupied Palestine despite ongoing attacks by occupation forces. Furthermore, the Front stated that the latest attack on Palestine Today satellite channel is the latest in a systematic and continuing policy of the targeting of journalists. It is clearly an insult and violation of international conventions and resolutions that affirm the sanctity of the freedom of the press and the rights of journalists. It called on international institutions and organizations, such as the International Federation of Journalists and other media organizations to hold the occupation accountable internationally for their racist, criminal attacks against the Palestinian people, including the targeting of journalists.
