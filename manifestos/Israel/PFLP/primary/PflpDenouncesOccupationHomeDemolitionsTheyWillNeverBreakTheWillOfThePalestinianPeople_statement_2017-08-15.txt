The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the demolition of the homes of two of the strugglers of the Waâ€™ed al-Buraq (Promise of al-Buraq) heroic operation and the closure of the third in the village of Deir Abu Mashaal, and the demolition of the house of the heroic operation in Ofer in Silwad village, describing the demolitions as a policy of cowardice on the part of the occupation,
The Front considered that the experience confirmed the failure of this miserable policy that does not achieve its objectives but instead further motivates and inspires our people and the youth of the Intifada to confront the occupation, continue the resistance and implement more heroic operation to shatter the Zionist security system in more than one location in Jerusalem.
The Front urged the masses of our people to strengthen the popular support and embrace of the families whose homes were destroyed or closed, including raising funds to rebuild homes and contributing to alleviate their suffering. Further, the Front urged official organizations and NGOs to document this criminal policy and transfer it to international institutions in the context of war crimes and policies of collective punishment that contravene UN Security Council 1544 of 2004, the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and Article XVII and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The Front concluded by declaring that our people will continue their struggle to achieve their liberation despite the great challenges and the crimes of the occupation and its continuous terror against the Palestinian people.
