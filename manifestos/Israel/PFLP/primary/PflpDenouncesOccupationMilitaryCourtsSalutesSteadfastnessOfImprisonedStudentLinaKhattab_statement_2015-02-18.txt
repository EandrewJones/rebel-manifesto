The Ofer military court of the Zionist occupation sentenced a student at Bir Zeit University, Lina Khattab, to six months imprisonment, a fine of 6000 shekels and three years probation, convicting her of participating in a demonstration outside Ofer prison demanding freedom for Palestinian prisoners in December 2014.
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the occupation military courts as an illegitimate tool of the Zionist occupation used as a weapon against the Palestinian people and the rights of our people to resist occupation under internaitonal law.
The Front stated that the imprisonment of Lina Khattab, as well as the continuing policy of the arrest, abduction, abuse and torture of children, including the child Malak al-Khatib released only a frew days ago, and the detention of thousands of Palestinian men and women in harsh conditions demonstrates the fascist criminality of the occupation state.
The Front saluted the student Lina Khattab for her steadfastness, despite the abuses she was subjected to in the interrogation rooms of the occupier, noting that her actions in refusing all attempts to force her to confess make her a model of rejection of injustice and insistence on the judtice of the Palestinian cause, refusing to recognize the racist occupoer. The Front noted that the resilience embodied by Lina Khattab under arrest reveals the inability of the occupation – despite all of its attacks – to bring the Palestinian people to their knees and undermine their firm will.
