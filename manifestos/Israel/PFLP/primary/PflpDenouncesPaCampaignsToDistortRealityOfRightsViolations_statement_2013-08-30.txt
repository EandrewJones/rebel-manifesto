The Palestinian Authority and its security forces have recently undertaken a media campaign to twist facts and distort reality, especially in cases where the Authority has committed crimes against the political rights and freedom of expression of our people.
This method is evident in the suppression of the march on July 28, 2013 against a return to negotiations, when the Authority in the media twisted and overturned the facts, attempting to highlight the reactions of protesters to security force violence and abuse, while obscuring the actions of the members of the security forces that caused reactions.
We see the same method repeated in dealing with the march on Wednesday, August 28, 2013, organized by youth groups independent of any political faction, where they have excerpted scenes of selected events, publishing them on YouTube and social networking sites on the Internet and through media lacking in objectivity. These images attempt to highlight some statement and words of demonstrators and also claim that the PFLP and its members are the organizers of the march.
We in the PFLP strongly condemn the devious actions of the Authority and emphasize the following:
1) These actions are aimed at undermining the confidence of people to march and protest and express their opinion against the negotiating, distracting from the reality of the actions of the occupation and instead scrutinizing the sons and daughters of our people. Here we call out on all to participate in the rallies on September 7, 2013 on the anniversary of the martyrdom of the leader Abu Ali Mustafa, to emphasize our refusal to return to negotiations.
2) We express our highest appreciation of the role and activities of the independent youth groups and call upon them to continue to act without being deterred by these methods, and call upon the masses of our people to be aware of false media portrayals which promote twisted accounts that distort the facts.
