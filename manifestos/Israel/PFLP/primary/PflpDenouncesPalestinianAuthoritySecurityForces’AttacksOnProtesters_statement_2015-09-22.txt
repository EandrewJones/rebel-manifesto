The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the Palestinian Authority security apparatus’ suppression and attacks of marches held in the occupied West Bank in support of our people in occupied Jerusalem, including the beating of a child in Bethlehem with batons and feet, as a crime violating all national principles.
The Front stated that all justifications, excuses, and even security agencies’ stated “recognition of error” or apologies are insufficient and do not justify the continued suppression of protest.
Furthermore, said the Front, such attacks are not isolated cases or behavior by a few individuals of the security services, but instead represent an authoritarian approach that oppresses the Palestinian people and violates their rights in the service of the occupation project, whether directly or indirectly.
The Front emphasized the need to end once and for all the burden of the Oslo project on the Palestinian people on the political, security and economic levels, saying that these security agencies must be converted to provide defense of the Palestinian people and confront the attacks of the occupation and settlers, rather than to work hand in hand with the occupation to suppress Palestinian resistance while attacking Palestinian civilians.
