The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the murder of three Arab university students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina as a heinous crime that represents the growing racism and fascism in North America and Europe against people of color â€“ attacking Black people, other communities of color, and people identified as Arab and Muslim.
The PFLP further denounced the US and Zionist media propaganda and their role in perpetuating incitement and hatred against Arabs and Muslims, saying that this dehumanizing portrayal played a role in the murder of Deah Barakat, Yusor Abu Salha and Razan Abu Salha, Palestinian and Syrian American youth. The US media has engaged in this propaganda in order to beautify the image of US imperialism and the Zionist occupation and to justify the racist attacks of the US government, and is a major cause of the growing threat of racist and fascist crimes.
The PFLP urged the Arab and Palestinian communities to continue their organizing to confront this incitement, noting the numerous vigils of solidarity across the United States to stand in solidarity with the victims, and to protest this heinous crime and the racist system that spawned it.
The Front stated that the US government is responsible for this crime, because of its efforts in public and private to demonize Arabs and Muslims and anyone who stands against the criminal policies of imperialism in the world.
