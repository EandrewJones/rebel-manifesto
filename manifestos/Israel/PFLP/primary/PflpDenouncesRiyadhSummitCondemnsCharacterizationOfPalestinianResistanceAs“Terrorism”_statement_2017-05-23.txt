The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the so-called Arab-American-Islamic Summit in Riyadh, under the patronage of the largest global terrorist state, the United States of America, an attempt to confuse the situation and obscure the causes of war, terror and severe contradictions in the region. At the forefront is the continuous and unlimited American support for the Zionist entity in its occupation of Palestine and its non-compliance with international law and resolutions, the aggression of U.S. imperialism against the people and wealth of the Arab nation and the U.S. sponsorship of terror in Arab and Muslim countries for many years.
Further, the PFLP denounced U.S. president Donald Trump’s characterization of forces of the resistance and those who support it in its struggle against the Zionist enemy as “terrorist,” noting that this reveals the real objectives underlying the Riyadh summit. It aims to essentially form an alliance with the participation of Israel against the forces in the region defending their sovereignty from the Zionist project and U.S. imperialism in the region.
The Front called on the resistance forces and the Arab national liberation movement to confront this attempt to shuffle the cards in characterizing the resistance as “terror” by focusing on the primary contradiction with the Zionist entity in the region.
Further, the Front demanded that the Palestinian Authority reject the US president’s description of the resistance forces as “terrorist” after he noted that he will discuss this issue with Abu Mazen. In particular, the Front warns against any attempt to tighten the siege on the Gaza Strip under U.S. designations of “terror.”
