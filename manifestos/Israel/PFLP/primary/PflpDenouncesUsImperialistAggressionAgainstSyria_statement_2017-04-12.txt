The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounces the U.S. imperialist aggression on Syria. This attack aims to pre-empt any serious international or impartial investigation into the events in Khan Sheikhun and instead acts to liquidate Syrian sovereignty and support the most reactionary, violent forces, exposing the falsity of the Trump administration’s claims that it wants to “fight terrorism.”
The Front sees this aggression as taking place in full coordination with the Zionist entity and with those Arab reactionary parties that continue to insist on the entire dismantlement of the Syrian state; it is an attempt to cut the road before political efforts in the United Nations and a political solution that preserves the unity of Syria and its people.
This aggression cannot be separated from the ongoing, illegal and brutal aggression of the United States and its bombing campaigns in northern Syria in an attempt to consolidate the division and partition of the country and redirect the future of Syria away from its national role in standing against the Zionist entity and its expansionist ambitions.
The PFLP called on all Arab forces to stand in solidarity with Syria and its people and to denounce and condemn U.S. imperialist aggression. It is urgently necessary to unify efforts to resist U.S. aggression in the region and to condemn and confront the reactionary Arab regimes that partner with U.S. imperialism to support this aggression, support the most reactionary forces that terrorize the people and plan to destroy the Syrian state while opening their doors to normalization with the Zionist entity.
