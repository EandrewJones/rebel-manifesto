Abu Ahmad Fuad, Deputy General Secretary of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said on September 9 that the Front “deplores and condemns” the action of the US administration to list a number of leaders and activists of Hamas as well as Samir Kuntar on the “Specially Designated Global Terrorist” list.
The United States itself, its occupying armies and its criminal collaborators, is the number one terrorist in all forms against the peoples of the world, said Fuad.
US imperialism is willing to destroy and kill millions to achieve its goal of domination, exploitation and oppression of peoples seeking independence, liberation and true democracy, and to benefit from the resources of their own homelands.
If one is looking for terrorism, Fuad said, one will always find it primarily where the United States, its armies and security forces and collaborating forces are present, occupying and invading.
