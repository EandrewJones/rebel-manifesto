The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the so-called Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia and backed by US imperialism and its ongoing war on Yemen, noting the appalling massacre committed yesterday in Sanaa in the attack taking hundreds of lives.
The war against the Yemeni Arab people “aims to subjugate this unbowed and proud people as part of the imposition of a US-Zionist agenda in the region,” said Comrade Mahmoud Al Ras of the Central Committee of the PFLP.
This crime comes alongside the massacres committed by the Zionist enemy against the peoples of the region, especially the Palestinian people, said Al-Ras, noting that the international powers that back Saudi Arabia are responsible for the ongoing crimes against the Yemeni people, “which are designed to plunder the wealth of the people, suppress their spirit of resistance and constant commitment to the Arab nation and Palestine.”
The Front called on the forces of the Arab national liberation movement and the peoples of the Arab nation to act in defense of Yemen and stop the war, and reject the conspiracies targeting its national integrity. The Front expressed its full solidarity with the families of the victims and with the Yemeni people, who have always firmly adhered to the struggles of the Arab nation and the Palestinian people.
