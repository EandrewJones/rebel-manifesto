Commenting on the European draft resolution submitted to the United Nations Security Council, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine rejected the draft as reflecting a deal between members of the Security Council and the occupation state.
The occupation state is engaged in a criminal aggression against our people in the Gaza Strip, rising to the level of genocide. The Security Council has a responsibility to act immediately to stop the aggression that has killed 2100 Palestinians, nearly 600 children, and including women, men and elders, and destroyed tens of thousands of Palestinian homes completely or almost completely and displaced hundreds of thousands, and to hold the occupier accountable according to Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, and to act to end the occupation and implement the UN resolutions on the rights of the Palestinian people.
Instead, the draft resolution entirely evades the responsibility of the Council and ignores the real causes of the issue, and instead acts to protect the Zionist aggressor from accountability and punishment and to restrict and suppress the Palestinian resistance forces as a central goal of the draft resolution. Any language about humanitarian issues in the draft is based on “international monitoring” that monitors not the occupier and its aggression, but instead the Palestinian resistance, essentially basing humanitarian needs of our people on security coordination with the occupation state and claiming authority over all money, equipment and goods in the Strip.
The PFLP reiterated its complete rejection of any attempt to suppress our people and their resistance, who will continue to resist aggression and occupation so long as it remains implanted over our land and people in Palestine. Any cease-fire will be successful only to the extent that it achieves the rights of the Palestinian people.
