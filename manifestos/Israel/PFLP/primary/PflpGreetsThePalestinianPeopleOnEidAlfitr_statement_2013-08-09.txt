The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine extended its warmest greetings on Eid al-Fitr to the masses of our steadfast Palestinian people inside and outside the homeland.
On this occasion, we wish to strengthen the bonds of national unity and social cohesion across the spectrum of Palestinian society. Eid is a day to visit the families of martyrs and prisoners and support their steadfastness, and to build a positive climate to end division and restore national unity, on the basis of adherence to national principles, self-determination, independence, Jerusalem and the right of return of refugees to their homes; and to confront the scourge of normalization with the Zionist enemy and all attempts to liquidate the Palestinian national cause.
The Front extends a special salute to the brave prisoners in the occupation prisons on this occasion; the holiday is an opportunity to recall their suffering and steadfastness, and to stand beside them with all forms of solidarity with the prisonersâ€™ movement. May you be well each year, to our Palestinian people and to our Arab and Muslim sisters and brothers.
