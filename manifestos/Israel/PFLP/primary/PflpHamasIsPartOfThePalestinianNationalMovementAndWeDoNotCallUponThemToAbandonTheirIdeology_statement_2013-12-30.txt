The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, responding to claims in Palestinian media that the “factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization” have called upon Hamas to disengage from the Muslim Brotherhood, emphasizes the following:
1) Hamas is a vital part of the Palestinian national movement, and this is the position of the PFLP.
2) We do not call on Hamas or any other movement to give up their ideology or their references.
The PFLP calls on all parties to build their relationships with Arab and Islamic parties on the basis of the higher interests of the Palestinian people and not based on ideological considerations.
