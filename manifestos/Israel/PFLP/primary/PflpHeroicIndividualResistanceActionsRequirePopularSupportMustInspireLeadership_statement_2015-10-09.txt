The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine confirmed that the upsurge in individual resistance actions carried out by heroic Palestinian youth throughout the occupied homeland are important operations that must continue, escalate and evolve, and need popular support in the West Bank and Jerusalem in various forms in light of the occupierâ€™s continuous crimes against our people.
The PFLP emphasized that these resistance actions have taken multiple forms, including resistance with knives; this stems from the resolve and determination of the Palestinian youth to restore their land and their rights of which they are deprived, and their conviction in the justice of their cause.
The Front said that the Zionist enemy should know that every Palestinian is a potential guerrilla to confront the occupation and the settlements; there is no place to find security or stability as a colonizer. The Palestinian people will not give up their rights until the last drop of blood in their veins.
The Front also emphasized the need to support these individual actions on an organized level through the immediate call to form a unified national leadership in all areas, to manage and lead this battle and to elevate the level of resistance actions to deal serious blows to the Zionist entity and the settlers. The Front also emphasized the need to embrace the families of the heroic guerrillas, and provide whatever they need to support them, and to defend them from attacks by the occupation.
