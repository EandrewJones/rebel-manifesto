The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the imprisonment of Comrade Khalida Jarrar and the occupation military court’s sentencing her to fifteen months in Zionist prison, noting that such arrests and sentences are a part of the ongoing terror campaign against the Palestinian people and the direct targeting of Palestinian leaders.
The imposition of this sentence after many months of repeated postponements is an expression of the occupation’s failure and confusion in dealing with Comrade Jarrar’s case, as it previously failed to expel her to Jericho and in holding her under administrative detention, said the Front.
The Front also reiterated that the occupation military courts are illegitimate and should not be recognized; they are mere tools of repression in the hands of the occupier. It called for the issue of the imprisonment of members of the Palestinian Legislative Council to be raised before the United Nations, as well as the targeting of Palestinian women for imprisonment and killing, which has been escalating since the beginning of this intifada in an attempt to suppress women’s participation.
The Front praised the will and determination of the leader Khalida Jarrar, noting that she is a symbol of the Palestinian struggle and steadfastness against the occupation.
