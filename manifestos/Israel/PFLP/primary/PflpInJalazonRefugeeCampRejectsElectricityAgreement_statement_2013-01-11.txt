[singlepic id=593 w=320 h=240 float=right]The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Jalazon refugee camp stated its rejection of the agreement on electricity signed by the Executive Office of the Popular Committees of the camps and the Palestinian Authority, which mandates the installation of electricity meters at each home in the refugee camp and individual billing for electricity, replacing a system in which refugees’ electricity was provided by the camps. This agreement The Front noted that this statement was signed by representatives of a particular political trend and the Authority, and does not provide social justice to all in the camps, cities and villages who are suffering from difficult economic circumstances.
The Front also noted that the agreement was a further step toward “settling” the refugee camps in the West Bank and denying their unique status. Any attempts to “permanently settle” refugees and undermine their right to return are rejected by the Front and the entire Palestinian national movement. The Front emphasized that it is the responsibility of the international organization, UNRWA, to provide all services for Palestinian refugees, and highlighted this as an example of the systematic reduction of programs and services for refugees.
The Front also said that it is clearly time to work on rebuilding the Popular Committees in the camps with all political and national forces. At the end of the statement, the Front emphasized the full responsibility of the parties to the agreement for all consequences to the people of the camp in light of the agreement, and confirmed that it will stand by the people.
