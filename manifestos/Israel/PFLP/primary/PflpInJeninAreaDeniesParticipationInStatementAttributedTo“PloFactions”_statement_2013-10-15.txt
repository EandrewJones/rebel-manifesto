The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Jenin area confirmed that they did not participate in any press conference nor in the drafting of a statement issued in the name of “PLO factions” regarding the Palestinian Authority security mechanisms in Jenin. Further, the PFLP said that any statement from this meeting does not indicate any kind of national consensus, as it not only excludes the Islamic factions and forces but did not even include the factions of the PLO.
The Front said that local media reported upon a press conference at Fateh movement headquarters claiming to speak on behalf of the factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization regarding the security institutions and their crackdown on Jenin after the death of the hero and martyr Islam Toubasi. The Front emphasized that it did not participate in any such meeting in an official or unofficial level about the security crackdown that has provoked great unrest locally and even at a national level. The Front said that its position is quite clear, saying that it has been expressed in multiple forums, supporting the community protecting its own security and protecting the resistance and its weapons and emphasizing the need to refuse and resist any form of security coordination with the Israeli occupation.
The Front said that the storming of Jenin refugee camp and the attacks on the homes of activists like Sheikh Bassam Saadi, Sheikh Jamal abu al-Hija and others have nothing to do with achieving civil peace and instead reflect actions of the security services working in coordination with the occupation.
The Front emphasized the unity of the national movement should be held at the forefront, as should the safety and security of all Palestinians, with an emphasis on protecting the resistance, freedom of opinion and expression and political pluralism and diversity.
