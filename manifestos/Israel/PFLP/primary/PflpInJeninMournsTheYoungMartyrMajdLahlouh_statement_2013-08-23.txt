The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Jenin region saluted the young martyr Majd Mohammad Anis Lahlouh (Abu Shahlah), who fell as a martyr in the violent clashes in Jenin refugee camp at dawn on Tuesday, August 20, 2013, at the hands of the bullet of a Zionist murderer.
In a press statement, the PFLP said that the continuing nightly Zionist aggressions in Jenin prove once again that confrontation of the occupation and the path of resistance impose themselves on the Palestinian people. The Palestinian people cannot accept constantly being subject to these attacks.
Amid calls for continuing the negotiations approach and return to the path of settlement, this martyr, Majd, a university student from Jenin camp, who opposed Zionist aggression and attempted to prevent the arrest of a member of the resistance, is the voice of the people who should be leading the Palestinian national liberation movement at all levels.
The Front said that Jenin is mourning today and a mass funeral for Majd will take place after noon prayer in the mosque in Jenin camp, marching toward Martyrs Cemetery. It expressed its great pride in the bravery of young people and students who reject humiliation and refuse to obey the occupation and its ongoing aggression. It is incumbent upon us to honor the struggle of the masses of our people and continue on Majdâ€™s path of struggle until the liberation of the land and people from Zionist oppression.
