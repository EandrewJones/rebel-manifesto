The Popular Front for the Liberation in the village of Kobar northwest of Ramallah urged the building of a broad popular campaign to rebuild the home of the family of Palestinian prisoner Omar Abdel-Jalil al-Abed and open the streets of the village.
On Thursday, 17 August, masked youths of the PFLP in Kobar went to the family home, attacked and bulldozed by the occupation forces, and decorated it with Palestinian flags. They painted on the remaining walls and throughout the village “Al-Fida’i Omar al-Abed” (The struggler, Omar al-Abed)  as well as the image of Omar on the main street at the entrance to the village, sending a message to the occupation that the people embrace the resistance and their families.
In the past few weeks, there has been a mass popular stand in the village of Kobar against the occupation forces. People have struggled to protect the village, confront the occupation army, opening roads and closing the road before invading forces. People of the village have confronted the occupation forces and have been repeatedly injured and arrested.
The Ofer military court ordered the further detention of the prisoner’s family members, including his mother, father and brother for 5 days under the pretext of completing interrogation. Omar al-Abed carried out a resistance operation on 21 July in the illegal settlement of Halamish built on the lands of the villages of Nabi Saleh and Deir Nizam northwest of Ramallah and near his hometown of Kobar, killing three occupation settlers and injuring a fourth; he was imprisoned after being shot by a settler.
