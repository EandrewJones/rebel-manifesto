The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine continued the commemoration of its 48th anniversary with events in Palestinian refugee camps throughout Lebanon.
In the north of Lebanon, the PFLP held a mass rally in Nahr al-Bared camp, widely attended by the people of the camp, members, cadres and supporters of the Front, and members of political parties and social and cultural institutions.
Comrade Fathi Abu Ali opened the event, speaking about the history of the Front and the current rising intifada. Mohammed Bashir, of the Communist Party of Lebanon, spoke, saluting the front as a “revolutionary organization which has from its first day adopted the option of armed struggle and the commitment to liberate Palestine from the river to the sea.” He saluted the Palestinian people and their heroic intifada.
Comrade Marwan Abdel-Al, leader of the Front’s branch in Lebanon, gave the keynote speech at the event, focusing on the rising intifada in Palestine, emphasizing the need for a breakthrough in the Palestinian national movement that is equal to the commitment and sacrifices of the people and to “estalish a new and authentic vision that surpasses that of Oslo and division and confronts the occupier.” He also focused on the situation of Palestinians in Lebanon, emphasizing that the core of the struggle is the right of return for Palestinian refugees. He noted the crisis faced by Palestinians in Lebanon, including the financial crisis of UNRWA which is, he noted, not natural but manufactured in order to liquidate the situation of Palestinian refugees. He noted that improving the material conditions of Palestinian refugees and recognizing their human and civil rights within Lebanon is central to empowering their role in the Palestinian liberation movement and the struggle for return.
