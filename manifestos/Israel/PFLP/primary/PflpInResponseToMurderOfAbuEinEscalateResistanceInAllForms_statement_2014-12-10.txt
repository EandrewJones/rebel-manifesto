The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine joins the Palestinian people in mourning the martyred leader Ziad Abu Ein, a member of the Revolutionary Council of Fateh movement and Chair of the Committee Against the Wall and Settlements.
Abu Ein died after being attacked by occupation soldiers who assaulted him with tear gas during a procession to plant olive trees on the land of Turmusayya village, north of Ramallah, threatened with confiscation and colonization.
The Front expresses its sincere condolences to the Fateh movement and commends the struggler Abu Ein, who defended the rights of our people and confronted the Zionist occupation.
The life of the martyr is marked by struggle and confrontation with the occupation, including imprisonment and deportation, as well as his confrontation of the racist annexation wall.
The response to the death of Ziad Abu Ein must be to escalate resistance in all of its forms. The PFLP demands that the Palestinian Authority immediately end security cooperation with the occupation. The strength of the masses of our people must be unleashed to carry out revolutionary action in all areas of Palestinian struggle.
