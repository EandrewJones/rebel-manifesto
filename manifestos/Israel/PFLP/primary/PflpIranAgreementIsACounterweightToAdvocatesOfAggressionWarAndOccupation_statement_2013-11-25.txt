The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine welcomes the agreement on the Iranian nuclear file, and views it as a step in support of security and stability in the region, countering the advocates of occupation, war and aggression.
The essence of the conflict of the region is the Palestinian cause and the Arab-Zionist conflict, despite the efforts of the occupation and its supporters to replace these fundamental conflicts with the so-called “Iranian nuclear file” and the “Sunni-Shiite conflict.” There have been many attempts to blur this reality and to block the struggle for the Palestinian rights to return, self-determination, independence, and our capital in Jerusalem.
The Front notes that this agreement confirms that resilience and rejection of imperialism and Zionism is the only way to protect legitimate rights and interests and to open the door before the solidarity and mutual progress of the people of the region, their freedom, development, justice and human dignity.
