The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said that todayâ€™s resistance operation in occupied Jerusalem comes in the context of the ongoing intifada, and is a natural response to the occupation and the attacks of the settlers, and confirms once more the Palestinian position and identity of Jerusalem against the schemes of the occupier to erase Palestinian existence with Judaization plans. The Front expressed its salutes to the martyr Musbah Abu Sbeih, shot by occupation forces during his operation.
The operation expresses that there remains an open conflict between the Palestinian people and the Zionist occupier throughout the land of Palestine, and that all of the collective punishment, mass arrests and brutal attacks will not stop the continuing Palestinian resistance.
The Front emphasizes the importance of sustaining and supporting the ongoing intifada through Palestinian national unity around a program of resistance and strengthening popular organization and struggle toward achieving liberation for the Palestinian people.
