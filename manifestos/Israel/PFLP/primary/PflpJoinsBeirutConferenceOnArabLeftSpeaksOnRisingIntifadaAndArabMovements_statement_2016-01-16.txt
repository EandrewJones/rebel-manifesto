The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine joined Arab leftists from Tunisia, Kuwait, Syria, Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, Iraq, Sudan and Jordan in Beirut, Lebanon, for the Seventh Arab Left Conference, organized by the Lebanese Communist Party.
Comrade Marwan Abdel-Al, leader of the Front in Lebanon, spoke at the event about the rising intifada in Palestine, saluting the role of Palestinian youth, as well as noting the wekness of the Palestinian national movement as well as the Arab liberation movement at this point. He urged self-criticism and reflection on the reasons for the decline of the Arab left in order to reassert itself as a strong and popular force to challenge counter-revolution and reaction.
The meeting was opened by Marie Nassif-Debs, who identified the three central focuses as the organization of an Arab national response to imperialist aggression, occupation and hegemony and to Zionism; activation and mobilization of the working class, peasants, popular classes and revolutionary intellectuals for economic advancement, development and social justice; and the defense of democracy, equality and social and public freedoms.
The General Secretary of the LCP, Khalid Hadadeh , spoke about the Saudi execution of Sheikh Nimr el-Nimr as part of the US plan for sectarian and religious conflict in the region, blocking attention and mobilization on the Palestinian cause and confrontation of Zionism, noting that the heroic Palestinian uprising has returned a strong level of interest and attention to the central conflict in the region.
The parties from various countries made interventions at the event, focusing on supporting the Palestinian cause and developing a new type of liberation movement composed of democratic and progressive forces.
