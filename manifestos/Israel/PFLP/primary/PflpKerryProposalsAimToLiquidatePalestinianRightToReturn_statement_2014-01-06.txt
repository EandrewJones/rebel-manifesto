US Secretary of State John Kerry is attempting to liquidate the right of Palestinian refugees to return through floating plans for “resettlement” in Australia and other countries, warned Dr. Rabah Muhanna, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
Kerry’s role in the region is working hand in hand with the Zionist occupation and its plans for Jerusalem and Palestine as a whole, Muhanna said, stating that Palestinian officials must end their involvement with the negotiations scheme. The goal of this project is to attempt to provide legitimacy for the Zionist occupation and its existence, directly or indirectly, in the Jordan Valley, the continued expansion of settlements and the control of major areas of the West Bank through settlement blocs, Muhanna said. Kerry’s treacherous resettlement plans are aimed at liquidating the right of return of Palestinian refugees, the core of the national cause, he added.
He noted that Saudi Arabia and Jordan and other Arab regimes are playing a role in supporting Kerry’s plan to concede Palestinian national rights. Muhanna urged mass Palestinian action to demand that Palestinian officials reject these dangerous plans and negotiations that will lead nowhere except for the threat of the birth of a new Oslo accord.
