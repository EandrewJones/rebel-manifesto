Kidnapping occupation soldiers and settlers is important, and a legitimate right to liberate our prisoners, said Comrade Jamil Mizher, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
It is the right of the Palestinian people to engage in resistance and capture occupation soldiers and settlers wherever possible, in order to put pressure on the occupation and force him to release prisoners who have been struggling for the dignity of the Arab nation, Mizher said.
The occupation ignores all international norms and covenants in its oppression, aggression and torture against the Palestinian people and the Palestinian prisoners, said Mizher.
He emphasized that these actions are a right of the Palestinian resistance and must continue until the defeat of the occupation, the full recognition of Palestinian rights, and until the prisoners are free with their families and their people.
The Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades, armed wing of the PFLP, congratulated the operation in Hebron in which the heroic resistance captured three Zionist settlers, and declared that the Palestinian people and their resistance have a legitimate right to this brave and effective method against the occupying forces and settlers to free their prisoners.
