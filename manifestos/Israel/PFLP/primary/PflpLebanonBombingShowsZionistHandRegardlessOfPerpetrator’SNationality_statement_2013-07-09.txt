The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine condemned the explosion that took place this afternoon in the southern suburbs of Beirut as a crime of iniquity.
Comnrade Marwan Abdel-Al, member of the political bureau of the PFLP and leader of its branch in Lebanon, said that this treacherous attack on the proud suburb of Bir al-Abed, whose resistance humbled the Zionist enemy, shows the hand of Zionism, no matter the nationality of those who committed the crime. He warned against attempts to undermine stability in Lebanon, and of the need for vigilance against attempts to provoke sectarian strife, saying such are attempts to destroy the Arab nation and its future.
He emphasiuzed that unity and national responsibility to the people are the only guarantees to protect the integrity of Lebanon.
