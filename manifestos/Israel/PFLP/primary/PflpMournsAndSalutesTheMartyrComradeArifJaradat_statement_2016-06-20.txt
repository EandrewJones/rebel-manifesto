The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine joins the masses of the Palestinian people in mourning the martyr, Comrade Arif Jaradat, 23, from the village of Sair near al-Khalil.
Comrade Jaradat died on the evening of Sunday, June 19 from wounds he sustained last month when he was shot by the occupation forces invading Sair.
The Front saluted the family of the martyr and the village of Sair. No matter his own struggles as a person with Down syndrome, Comrade Jaradat always took his full place alongside his comrades and fellow Palestinians, and always participated in protests and resistance to the occupation forces which daily invade the village of Sair.
Glory to the martyrs â€“ Victory is inevitable
