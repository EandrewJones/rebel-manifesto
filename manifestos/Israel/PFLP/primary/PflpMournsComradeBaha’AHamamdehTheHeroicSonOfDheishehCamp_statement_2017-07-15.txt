The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine joins the masses of the Palestinian people in mourning the heroic Comrade Baha’a Ismail Hamamdeh, 18, who fell as a martyr this morning while confronting occupation forces invading Dheisheh refugee camp.
Today, Bethlehem and Dheisheh lose a brave hero who, despite his young age, disturbed the rest of the occupation as he clashed with occupation forces at the entrances to the city of Bethlehem and during multiple invasions of Dheisheh camp. The occupation sought him for arrest more than once and he was injured on several occasions by occupation forces.
The Front expresses its deepest condolences to his family and to all of the comrades in Dheisheh and pledges to him and to all the martyrs to continue on the path of resistance until we achieve the dream of our people to return and to fully liberate our homeland, Palestine.
Today, the heroic martyr Comrade Bara’a was killed by occupation forces as they engaged in a criminal campaign of attacks and arrests against the cadres of the Popular Front in Dheisheh camp, the village of Deir Abu Mashaal and elsewhere in the occupied West Bank amid continuous targeting of its leaders. It comes at a time when the courtyards of Al-Aqsa Mosque are witnessing a bold and courageous operation targeting armed Israeli occupation forces. This action confirms that the flame of resistance continues to burn and that the occupation’s policies of attacks, killings, arrests, home demolitions, land confiscation and targeting of cadress will never quench that fire of resistance.
