The Popular Front for the Liberation mourns Palestinian struggler and comrade Ferial Hatem Nasrallah (Um Imad) after she passed away in exile in Berlin, Germany on January 29, 2017 at the age of 53 after a terminal illness.
The PFLP, its general secretary Comrade Ahmad Sa’adat and all of its fighters and comrades salute the comrade with sadness and loyalty and pledge to continue to struggle until we achieve her goals of return and liberation of Palestine.
The Palestinian and Arab masses in Berlin bid farewell to Comrade Ferial Nasrallah on February 3 in a large funeral attended by a number of Palestinian community activists and leaders.
The Front declared that the loss of Comrade Nasrallah is a significant one for the struggle for Palestinian rights and liberation, especially in Germany, as the comrade struggled until the last moment of her life. She never hesitated to work for Palestine in the harshest of conditions, personally or politically. Her experience of struggle in the service of her people is a real model for all freedom fighters.
A memorial will be held on the 40th day marking her passing and will also commemorate International Women’s Day, on Saturday, March 11 at 6:00 pm at Waterloo-Ufer in Berlin’s Kreuzberg neighborhood.
