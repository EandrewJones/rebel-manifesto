The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine mourns the martyr Ziad Awad, killed by the occupation army while protesting after the funeral of the martyr, Jaafar Awad, in the village of Beit Ummar north of al-Khalil. The Front also extends its sincere condolences to the Palestinian people on the martyrdom of freed prisoner, Jaafar Awad, at dawn in al-Khalil. His death was caused by the policy of medical negligence and abuse by occupation forces in Zionist jails, the impact of which is carried long after freedom from captivity.
The Front urged all official and popular institutions and the International Committee of the Red Cross to take action to confront the policy of medical abuse practiced systematically against Palestinian prisoners, targeting their lives, and ensure that prisoners receive appropriate treatment and medications, and full health care in independent hospitals for prisoners suffering from chronic disease or severe illness.
The Front also demanded that the Health Ministry and medical institutions act to expand the system of health care protection for freed prisoners and conduct periodic tests for their health, including investigating any chronic illnesses in order to address them before they become more severe and lead to the deterioration of health and the loss of life. Our freed prisoners are national symbols and precious for the future of Palestine.
