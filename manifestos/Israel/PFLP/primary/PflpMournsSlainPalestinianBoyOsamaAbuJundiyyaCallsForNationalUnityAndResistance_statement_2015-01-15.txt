The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine urged Palestinian national unity and resistance in response to the killing of Palestinian boy Osama Ali Mohammed Abu Jundiyya, 17, between al-Khalil and Bethlehem on Wednesday night, January 14. He was killed by occupation forces as part of the ongoing settler terror and continuous assaults on our people, noted the Front, which requires a comprehensive national strategy of confrontation of the Zionist occupation and its crimes.
The Front expressed its sincere condolences to the Palestinian people and to the family of the young martyr, and reiterated that the crime of cold-blooded murder is a systematic Zionist policy which has tended to escalate on the eve of the elections in the occupation state, in which the leaders of the occupation trade Palestinian blood for votes.
The Front urged national Palestinian unity to confront the ongoing assaults on our people, their lives, their land and their rights.
