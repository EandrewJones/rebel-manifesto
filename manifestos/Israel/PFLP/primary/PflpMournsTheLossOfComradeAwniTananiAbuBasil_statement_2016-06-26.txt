The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine mourns the loss of Comrade Awni Tanani (Abu Basil), of Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza. The son of a struggling family and a militant veteran of the Front, his life was filled with sacrifice, love and dedication to serve his people and his homeland.
The Front extends to his family and his colleagues its sincere condolences and sorrow on the departure of this generous and unique comrade, a model of sacrifice and dedication to the people and to Palestine, who was modest, hard-working and always built warm relationships with his comrades, his friends and the people.
We pledge to our comrade to walk on his path until we achieve our goals of liberation of the entire Palestinian national homeland from Zionist occupation.
