The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine mourns the loss of the struggling Archbishop Hilarion Capucci, an icon and a role model, who placed the struggle against the Zionist entity above all and played his religious role in the service of the struggle, even in the prisons of the occupation. When he was released, he continued his struggle around the world, defending the rights of the Palestinian people and building support for the Palestinian cause, and exposing the plans and policies of the racist Zionist entity.
The Palestinian people and the Arab nation have lost a great, honorable fighter. We will be loyal to his legacy of struggle by continuing to fight for the liberation of Palestine until we achieve victory. We salute his strong position against sectarianism and reactionary thought, which have devastated his native Aleppo and his homeland of Syria, through building a broad Arab national progressive front to confront this threat across the region that restores the progressive vision of the struggle of the Arab people for liberation, emancipation and unity.
