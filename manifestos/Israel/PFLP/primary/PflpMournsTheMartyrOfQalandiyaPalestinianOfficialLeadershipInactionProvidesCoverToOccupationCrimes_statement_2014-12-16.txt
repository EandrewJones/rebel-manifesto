The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine issued a statement on December 16, joining the Palestinian masses in mourning the martyr of Qalandiya refugee camp, Mahmoud Abdullah Adwan, 21, murdered in a new Zionist crime when he was shot in cold blood by occupation forces. The Front called upon the resistance factions and the Palestinian masses to continue the escalation of resistance in response to the crimes of the occupation, as a true deterrent to the terror of the soldiers and settlers.
The position of the Palestinian official leadership has taken no serious decisions in response to the clear demands of the people, particularly the demand to immediately end security cooperation with the occupier, said the PFLP.
The Front urged a complete break with negotiations and security coordination, never to return to these attacks on the Palestinian resistance and people, as a necessary action to respect the blood of the martyr and all martyrs of the Palestinian people, warning against imperialist projects aiming to block the road to Palestinian rights, such as the so-called French initiative to promote negotiations.
The lack of any serious response from the Palestinian official leadership to the crimes of the occupation provides cover for the continuation of those crimes, noted the Front.
