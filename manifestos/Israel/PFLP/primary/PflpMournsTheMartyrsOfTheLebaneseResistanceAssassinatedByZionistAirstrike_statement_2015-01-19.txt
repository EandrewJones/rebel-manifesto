The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine sent a message of condolences to Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the General Secretary of Hezbollah, in the name of its General Secretary, Comrade Ahmad Sa’adat, and all of the leadership and members of the PFLP, mourning the martyrs, six Hezbollah leaders and cadres assassinated in Syria by a Zionist airstrike.
The Front saluted Hezbollah’s “escalation of the resistance as a strategic option and a comprehensive culture…building a serious force to be reckoned with and confronting the Zionist enemy both with words and deeds, which has earned the well-deserved respect of the revolutionaries of the world.”
The Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades, the armed wing of the PFLP, had earlier issued a statement mourning the slain leaders of the Lebanese resistance: Mohammed Issa, Jihad Imad Mughniyyeh, Abbas Hijazi, Mohammed Ali Hassan Abu al-Hassan, Razi Ali Dawi and Ali Hassan Ibrahim, noting that the Palestinian and Arab resistance are together in the fight against the Zionist criminal enemy.
