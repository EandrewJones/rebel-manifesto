The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, its General Secretary, Comrade Ahmad Saâ€™adat, deputy General Secretary, Comrade Abu Ahmad Fuad, and the Political Bureau, Central Committee, cadres and members, mourn the passing of national leader, Comrade Adnan Jaber (Abu Mithqal), member of the Central Committee of the PFLP, who died at the age of 73 years old on December 16, after a long life spent in the struggle for the liberation of Palestine.
The Front sends its deepest condolences to the family of the late freedom fighter and to the masses of the Palestinian people, and salutes his long history of struggle. Our comrade was born in Jerusalem in 1942, and joined the Arab Nationalist Movement as a student in Syria, where he studied philosophy and participated in the establushment of the ANM in Syria. There he was arrested and subject to severe forms of torture.
After the 1967 war, he continued his struggle in the PFLP in political and military fields of work. He was soon arrested and sentenced to 8 years in prison and deportation, a deportation that was blocked through legal and political struggle. He was arrested multiple times and held in Israeli prisons, including under administrative detention without charge or trial, most recently in 2003.
Comrade Jaber significantly contributed to organizing inside the Zionist prisons, which he and his comrades transformed into centers of mobilization and education and preparation for national struggle; he was a leader with charisma and creativity who served in multiple positions in the PFLP, most recently as a member of the Central Committee.
