The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said that occupation Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the representative of ultra-extremism and settlement, will not deceive the international community with his speech at the United Nations on September 27 2012.
The Front said that Netanyahu instead looks like a fool before the world, and that Netanyahu’s call for so-called “negotiations” based on the “recognition of the Jewish state” and his crocodile tears for the so-called “peace” make clear that this strategy means only state terror, settlements and land theft, and war crimes against the people, the land, their rights and their holy places. The Front warned that Netanyahu’s ominous discourse and threats of war and aggression against the Palestinian people and the countries of the region requires united Palestinian and Arab action to defend our national interests and security, by rejecting the so-called peace process and developing a new strategy based on national steadfastness and resistance to U.S. hegemony and Zionist projects in the region.
