The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, in a message to the Palestinian masses, mourned the sons of the resistance of al-Khalil, Marwan Qawasmeh and Amer Abu Eisha, who were assassinated this morning in a new Zionist crime targeting the martyrs.
The Front said that this crime proves once again that the enemy is criminal and practices terror in all forms against the Palestinian people, and that the resistance is the only force that is capable of confronting these crimes.
The Front said that the assassinated heroes are martyrs of the Palestinian people and their just struggle against the occupation, which has lasted for generations but will not be permanent on this land. It demanded an end to the absurd and endless negotiations and the ugly, dangerous security cooperation with the occupier and denounced all defeatist claims or justifications of disarming the resistance.
The Front renewed its call for the immediate end of Palestinian Authorityâ€™s security coordination in all forms and the rejection of normalization of all kinds with the criminal entity, and to instead adopt the language of confrontation, the language of our people, against this occupation.
In the face of this crime and the ongoing and continuous attacks on the ground against our people and their rights, it is critical to build Palestinian national unity which looks toward Palestine as the compass that governs us, directs us and points us toward resistance and victory.
Glory to the martyrs of the freedom of Palestine
