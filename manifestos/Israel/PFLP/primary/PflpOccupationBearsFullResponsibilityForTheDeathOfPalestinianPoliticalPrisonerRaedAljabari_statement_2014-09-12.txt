The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine stated that the Zionist occupation state bears full responsibility for the martyrdom of the Palestinian political prisoner, Raed AbdelSalam al-Jabari, who died in Soroka Hospital as a result of the racist and facist repression policies of the occupation state and its agents in Israeli jails against our brave prisoners.
There is a Zionist attack targeting Palestinian prisoners and intensifying their suffering in order to break their will, which is steadfast and committed to confront the occupation. Palestinian prisoners’ steadfastness only increases with the fall of each martyr. The Front urged the masses of the Palestinian people, inside occupied Palestine and in exile and diaspora, to stand with the prisoners until they achieve their rights and their freedom from the occupier’s prisons.
The Front urged immediate united action of the prisoners’ movement through the prisoners’ national leadership, struggling for the rights of the prisoners and the entire Palestinian people, and defying any attempts to divide the movement, which provides the enemy with opportunities to continue its policies against Palestinian land and people, including the prisoners.
