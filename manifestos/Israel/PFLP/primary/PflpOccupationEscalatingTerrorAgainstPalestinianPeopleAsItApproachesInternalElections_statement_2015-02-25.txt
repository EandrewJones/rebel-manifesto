The occupation will escalate its aggression in the coming days, warned the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, noting the ongoing escalation in the last days, marked by the killing of young Palestinian martyr Jihad al-Jaafari, repeated invasions of camps, towns and villages, and a campaign of mass arrests against Palestinian youth, coinciding with the Zionist elections.
The Front offered its sincere condolences and pride to our Palestinian people in Dheisheh refugee camp in Bethlehem on the martyrdom of the young man, Jihad al-Jaafari, in the field of confrontation of the occupation forces that were trying to storm the camp.
“The murder of this young man in Dheisheh is one of the many episodes of Zionist terror against the Palestinian people, which is not limited to murder and assassination, but the targeting of Palestinian existence and identity, mass arrests, demolition of homes and land confiscation, construction of colonial settlements on Palestinian land, and repression of their lives, work and movement,” said the Front.
The PFLP urged Palestinian unity to confront the crimes of the occupation and its growing brutality in the days leading up to the election, and building comprehensive resistance of the Palestinian people to confront these attacks.
