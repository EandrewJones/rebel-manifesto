The occupation state is fully responsible and must be held accountable for the murder of Palestinian worker Antar Shalaby al-Aqra and the assault on dozens of Palestinian workers at the hands of armed border police including “volunteers,” said the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
The PFLP said that this action is a new crime against the Palestinian people and an example of the racist occupation and the unrestrained barbarity of its security forces. The Front called upon regional and international labour unions and political parties to defend the rights of Palestinian workers, as well as for the United Nations and human rights organizations to condemn this crime, which joins the daily crimes that continue amid the silence of the international community.
The continuation of negotiations is used by the occupation as a cover for its crimes and brutality. It is urgent to end these negotiations and bring the occupation state before the International Criminal Court to hold it accountable for its ongoing crimes.
