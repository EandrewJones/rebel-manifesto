The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine salutes and mourns the martyr, Diaa Abdul Halim Talahmeh, who was killed by Israeli occupation army fire at Kharsa crossroads at southern Dura, south of al-Khalil. This crime and all of the crimes of the occupation will not be allowed to pass without the occupation paying a heavy price.
Amid the ongoing shedding of Palestinian blood, the escalation of the mass uprising of youth with stones and Molotov cocktails in the streets of Jerusalem and across the West Bank is a brilliant symbol of the continuing struggle of our people despite the vast sacrifices they have given, amid the escalation of Zionist terror. At this time it is particularly important to reemphasize the armed resistance to inflict serious losses upon the soldiers, settlers and the infrastructure of occupation.
The increase in the shooting of Palestinians at roadblocks and checkpoints which has led to the killing and wounding of many Palestinian civilians, is the practical manifestation of the resolutions and statements of the fascist occupation regime expanding its soldiersâ€™ targeting and aggresion against our people. It requires urgent action at the international level to move beyond condemnation of these crimes and act to stop the ongoing war crimes against our people throughout occupied Palestine.
