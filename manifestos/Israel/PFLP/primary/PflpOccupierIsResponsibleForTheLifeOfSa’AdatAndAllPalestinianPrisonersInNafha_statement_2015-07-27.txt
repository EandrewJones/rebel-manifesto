The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine holds the Zionist occupation and its prison authority fully responsible for the life of the imprisoned leader, Comrade Ahmad Sa’adat, and all prisoners in Nafha prison, following the attack on the prisoners by special forces of the occupation, who violently attacked sections in the prisons, sparking prisoners’ resistance, and injured a number of prisoners, burning multiple prisoners’ cells.
The conditions in Nafha prison are still burning, and this is expected to move to other prisons, especially Ramon and Beersheva after the insistence of the Palestinian political prisoners there that they will not remain silent about what is happening in Nafha.
The Front demanded that the International Committee of the Red Cross and international institutions act quickly to bring an end to the violent Zionist attacks on Palestinian prisoners in Nafha, which threatens to escalate dangerously in all prisons.
