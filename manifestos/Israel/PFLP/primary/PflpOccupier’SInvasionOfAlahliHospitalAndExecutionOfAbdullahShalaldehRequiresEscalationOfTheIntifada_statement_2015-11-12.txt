The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said that the attack of undercover Zionist forces against Al-Ahli Hospital in al-Khalil and the cold-blooded execution of Abdullah Azzam Shalaldeh, and the kidnapping of his cousin from the hospital, must urge further escalation of the intifada, targeting settlers and occupation forces by all means. The Front further considers that this crime reveals the character of the fascist state that does not cease its violation of international conventions, including international humanitarian law and conventions prohibiting attacks on hospitals.
The Front renewed its call to set up committees for popular protection in all cities, villages and camps to confront the crimes of the occupation and the settler hordes, and for the Palestinian security services to transform themselves into forces for the security and defense of our people and their institutions under attack, the most recent of which is Al-Ahli Hospital, following attacks on hospitals, schools, universities, Al-Aqsa Mosque and other centers of Palestinian life.
