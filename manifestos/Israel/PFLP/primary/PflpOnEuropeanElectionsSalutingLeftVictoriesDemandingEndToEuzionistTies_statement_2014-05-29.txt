The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine congratulates SYRIZA, the Coalition of the Radical Left in Greece, a strong opponent of austerity and supporter of Palestinian rights, on its victory in the European Parliament elections in Greece. The PFLP also extends its congratulations to the Workers Party of Belgium, which obtained 8 seats and 250,000 votes in the Belgian federal and regional elections, which took place simultaneously with the European parliamentary elections. We also salute Patrick Le Hyaric, French Communist journalist and director of L’Humanite and longtime friend of the Palestinian people, on his re-election as a Member of European Parliament, and extend our greetings to all other Left forces elected.
On May 23-25, 2014, voters in 28 European countries elected Members of the European Parliament directly, via proportional representation. The results of these elections indicate a rising resistance and rejection of the path of neoliberalism and austerity which have been imposed upon workers in Europe.
This path of neoliberalism and austerity has come hand in hand with EU imperialism, war-mongering and interventionism, and the strengthening of ties – particularly through “free trade” and other economic agreements – with the Zionist state at the expense of the Palestinian people and Palestinian rights.
The vote for SYRIZA in Greece is a clear rejection of austerity and subjugation as a path out of economic crisis, and the votes in many other countries, including Spain, indicate a growing rejection of the path of the European Union which has meant increasing austerity and neoliberalism at the expense of workers.
This rejection is most critically visible in the growth of anti-austerity movements, street protests, strikes and popular organizing. Mass organizing and action has also been highly visible in demanding the boycott of the Zionist state and an end to EU-“Israel” trade relations.
At the same time, the rise of ultra-right wing parties in these elections, most of whom relied on racist, anti-migrant, and often explicitly anti-Arab rhetoric in their campaigns, indicates the danger of fascism posed in this period of international economic crisis, and the necessity of real revolutionary forces grounded in the working class to defeat neoliberalism, austerity, fascism, imperialism and Zionism. Developing people-to-people solidarity and mutual revolutionary struggle to confront and defeat all of these forces is an urgent necessity at this time. The development of SYRIZA itself is a positive example of Left unity that is worthy of examination and application in different national and international contexts.
The viciously racist language and policies directed at migrants, Arab workers, and oppressed communities and national groups by the fascist parties, but also by the “mainstream” reactionary purveyors of austerity, is a continuing manifestation of the lengthy and deep history of European colonialism and is particularly twisted in light of the ongoing exploitation of Arab and African people’s land and resources by European corporations reaping the fruits of colonialism.
The occupation of Palestine and the imposition of the Zionist racist settler colony on Palestinian Arab land, the fragmentation of the Arab nation, the persistence of monarchy, sectarianism, reaction and dictatorship, the plundering of resources, and the ongoing imperial intervention and wars are the direct responsibility of European governments, whose colonial legacy in the Arab homeland continues to wreak havoc and destruction. From Sykes-Picot to the Balfour Declaration, the division of our people and our homeland and the imposition of settler colonialism is the responsibility of Europe.
We call upon the members of the European Parliament to immediately act to defend Palestinian rights and internationally isolate the Zionist state through comprehensive boycott, divestment and sanctions. It is a critical moment for Palestinian prisoners and detainees who have now been on hunger strike for over 35 days, demanding an end to the racist policy of administrative detention, under which Palestinian prisoners are held without charge or trial. The European Union must take action to demand the immediate end of administrative detention, including ending contracts and trade benefits for the Zionist state.
In addition, we call upon these newly elected members of the European Parliament to firmly oppose imperialist war and intervention, to end the use of the so-called “terror list” to delegitimize and criminalize Palestinian resistance to illegal occupation, and to demand the implementation of all Palestinian rights including the self-determination, independence, and the implementation of the right of return for Palestinian refugees.
The PFLP sent congratulations to SYRIZA, the Workers Party of Belgium, and Patrick Le Hyaric upon their elections:
