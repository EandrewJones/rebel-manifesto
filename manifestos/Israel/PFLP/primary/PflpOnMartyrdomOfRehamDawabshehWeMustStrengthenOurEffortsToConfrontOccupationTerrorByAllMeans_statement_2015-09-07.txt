The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine confirmed that the martyrdom of Reham Dawabsheh, the mother and teacher who joined her son and husband as a martyr, murdered in the burning of their home in a crime of unspeakable cruelty carried out by the colonizers, must strengthen our determination to open all options to respond to the terror and criminality of the occupier and its colonizers.
The Front emphasized that this horrific crime is but one manifestation of the systematic Zionist terror, killings and massacres against the Palestinian people for over 70 years; it is not the first such incident and will not be the last.
The Front emphasized that the blood of the Dawabsheh family and all of the martyrs of the Palestinian people must prompt the resistance to direct all of its capacities to respond strongly to the terror of the occupier, with resistance of all forms especially in the West Bank, particularly in the military bases and barracks of the occupier and the settlements and colonies.
The Front expressed its sincere condolences to the bereaved Dawabsheh family, which has lost three of its members as martyrs for freedom, urging the Palestinian official leadership that this heinous crime must be an additional motivation to bring the occupier and its leaders before the International Criminal Court for crimes against our people.
Further, the Front demanded that Palestinian leadership make an official announcement of the failure and the end of the Oslo project and completely cut off the political, security and economic relationship with the occupier at long last, as our people have been devastated by this disastrous project.
