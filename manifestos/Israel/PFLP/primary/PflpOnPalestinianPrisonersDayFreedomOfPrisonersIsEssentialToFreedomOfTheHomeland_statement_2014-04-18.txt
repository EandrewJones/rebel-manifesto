The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine issued a statement on April 17, Palestinian Prisoners’ Day, greeting the Palestinian people everywhere.
The Front saluted the struggle of the prisoners, describing them as the people of freedom, whose struggle is the essence of freedom and who have given so much to achieve human dignity and liberation in Palestine, full self-determination over the whole of Palestinian land, water, resources, livelihood and the future of Palestinian generations. This will not be complete without the return of all Palestinian refugees to their homes and lands from which they were displaced.
The Front saluted the prisoners of the PFLP and the prisoners of the entire Palestinian liberation movement inside Israeli jails, pledging that the issue of the prisoners is central to the survival of the resistance and the continuity of our struggle, through adhering to the principles for which the prisoners, the martyrs and the wounded have struggled and sacrificed so dearly.
The Front noted that the prisoners have always played a key role in mobilizing the Palestinian people and developing the Palestinian liberation movement, vibrant in the conscience and mind of our people wherever they are. The enemy attempts to use the prisoners as leverage, hostages and bargaining tools in the absurd negotiations table in exchange for settlements and Judaization, noted the statement.
The Front demanded no concessions to attempts to extend the negotiations, which only serve the interests of the occupation and the expansion of settlements and instead called for international isolation of the occupation entity and international boycott, which is growing around the world on various levels. Over 21 years of negotiations amid the massive expansion of settlements, the theft of over 90% of Palestinian groundwater, the apartheid wall devouring our land once more call out for Palestinians to, in the words of Ghassan Kanafani, “bang on the walls of the tank,” said the statement, calling for national unity, adhering to the resistance, and stating that freedom of prisoners is an integral part of the freedom of the land and people of Palestine.
