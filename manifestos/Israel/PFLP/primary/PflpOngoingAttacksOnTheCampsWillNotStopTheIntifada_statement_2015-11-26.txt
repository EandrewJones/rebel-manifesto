The continued targeting of Palestinian refugee camps, especially Dheisheh camp, for mass arrests including those targeting cadres and members of the Front, will not stop the growing resistance nor will it deter the Palestinian people from continuing the intifada and confronting occupation crimes, said the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
The dawn invasion in Dheisheh camp and the arrest of a number of comrades, coming after the attack on a number of houses and the arrest of comrades several days ago, and before that the invasions of Aida, Shuafat and Qalandiya refugee camps and various areas throughout the West Bank, exemplify the aggressive and comprehensive policy of the occupation against our people, particularly in the camps, which represent the firm core of the Palestinian resistance and confrontation of the occupation and settler crimes.
The Front noted that the growing frequency of arrests of young men and women in the West Bank and Jerusalem makes it clear that the Zionist state has failed to weaken the popular movements and confrontations that have drawn young people to confront them in the streets, at the entrances of cities and outside the settlement areas. The arrests have not prevented the continuation of the intifada and the youth confrontation of the occupier, noted the PFLP.
The Front called upon official and popular institutions to continually shed light on the issue of the prisoners; in recent weeks there has been a major escalation in the campaign of arrests, particularly targeting children, teen boys and girls and young men and women throughout the West Bank and Jerusalem.
