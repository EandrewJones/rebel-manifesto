The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the Zionist occupation military court’s transfer of Comrade Khalida Jarrar, PFLP leader and deputy in the Palestinian Legislative Council, to six months in administrative detention, as part of the systematic Zionist crimes against the authentic leadership of the Palestinian people.
This action against the leader Jarrar – as well as the administrative detention of Comrade Khitam Saafin – is an attempt to silence the democratic and revolutionary voices that confront the occupation and reject the approach of the Palestinian Authority and its destructive security coordination.
This systematic and continued targeting of the leaders of the Popular Front, led by Comrade Khalida Jarrar, will not succeed in breaking the will or the commitment to resistance. Jarrar and the leaders of the Front remain a thorn in the throat of the occupier and a mark of shame on those who engage in security coordination.
The Front urges the masses of the Palestinian people to escalate the movement in support of the prisoners in Israeli occupation prisons and against the policy of administrative detention and occupation crimes.
It also calls on all friends of Palestine and democratic forces, including European parliamentarians who support the Palestinian cause, to engage in a wider campaign of solidarity with the Palestinian prisoners, especially those in administrative detention and the imprisoned parliamentarians, led by the struggling comrades Jarrar and Saafin.
