The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in the West Bank issued a statement on March 25 noting that the Front’s patience has its limits with regard to the Palestinian Authority security forces’ continuing arrests and summonses of its members, supporters and fighters, particularly in Bethlehem area refugee camps.
“While the Zionist occupation forces continue their open war against the Palestinian people, the Palestinian Authority security apparatus offers them a free service in order to preserve its humiliating security commitments.” On Tuesday, three supporters of the Front were detained and interrogated in Dheisheh camp, then many more comrades issued summons, and more detained in ‘Azza and Aida refugee camps while another group in Aida camp is being pursued, said the Front.
This campaign against the comrades and the brothers of the resistance forces is taking place under a flimsy pretext, which coincides with the continuation of security coordination with the occupation, and gives the occupation the opportunity to target the resistance with assassination or arrest. The Front noted that the security agencies of the PA continue to pursue cadres of the resistance who have spent years in the prisons of the occupation, and that on multiple occasions, the occupation has issued a warrant for arrest immediately upon a resistance fighter’s release from the PA security services, or has targeted that person for assassination soon after. This was seen in the case of the heroes of the Jenin refugee camp and our comrade Moataz Washahe.
The Front demanded the Authority end the practice of issuing orders to security forces to hunt down members of the resistance to prove “good faith” to the occupier, end security coordination and instead stand with the people in defending our Palestinian people, confronting Zionist terror and extremist settlers.
