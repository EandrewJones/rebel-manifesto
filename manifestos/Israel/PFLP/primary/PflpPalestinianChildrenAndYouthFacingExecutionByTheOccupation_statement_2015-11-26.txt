The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the ongoing series of executions being carried out by the occupation against Palestinian children as crimes against humanity amounting to war crimes, revealing the racist and fascist nature of the occupation state.
The Front emphasized the need to document these crimes and bring the occupierâ€™s leaders, soldiers and settlers to justice before international courts, urging the world to end its silence on the crimes of the occupier against the Palestinian people.
The PFLP recalled that the killing of Palestinian children has been an ongoing feature of the Zionist war against our people, noting particularly the killing of hundreds of children in the 2014 aggression against the Gaza Strip, as well as what is happening now in the streets and cities of the West Bank anf Jerusalem.
The Front said that these repeated killings carried out by the occupation in full view of cameras, alongside its practices of continued displacement, home demolitions, arrests and continuous settler attacks serve as a catalyst that only sparks more Palestinian children, teens and youth to respond to these crimes with spontaneous operations of heroism and sacrifice their lives.
The Front stressed the urgent need and responsibility of all, including the Palestinian leadership and Palestinian factions to protect our children and teens from the crimes of the occupation and to nurture their flame of Intifada that must be kept burning.
