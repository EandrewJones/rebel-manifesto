The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is committed to the terms of the resistance in the paper presented in Cairo, said Comrade Abu Ahmad Fouad, Deputy General Secretary of the PFLP, calling on all factions and the unified Palestinian delegation to reject suggestions to delete some of those terms or postpone them to future negotiations, saying they should be dealt with as a package.
Fouad also urged the PLO Executive Committee to immediately accede to the Rome Statute and join all international institutions, particularly the International Criminal Court, related to pursuing the occupation state for war crimes trials, saying that any delay opens the path for the occupation and the United States to subdue this matter through postponement and compromise.
Comrade Dr. Maher al-Taher, member of the Political Bureau of the PFLP, said that the Palestinian delegation did not approve an extension of the ceasefire because the occupation has not responded to the Palestinian resistance conditions, saying that the occupation is trying to elude and maneuver and earn time. “If the Zionist side does not respond to these demands, then the Palestinian delegation will not sign any agreement,” said Taher.
He said that the delegation is engaged in a political battle that is an extension of the military battle and the battle of steadfastness in which our people in Gaza are locked, and which have created a historical milestone for their nation. He saluted the Palestinian people and the brigades of the armed resistance fighting on the battlefield, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Al-Quds Brigades, Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades, Al-Aqsa Brigades, National Resistance Brigades and Nasser Salaheddin Brigades).
“The responsibility for the lack of progress in Cairo is with the Zionist side, which refuses to respond to the terms of the resistance and the people,” said Taher.
