The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the planned meeting between PA President Mahmoud Abbas and occupation deputy Prime minister Shaul Mofaz as contrary to Palestinian national interests, saying that Palestinian interests require exposing the crimes of the occupation, rejecting the so-called peace process and an end to bilateral negotiations under US auspices, not meetings with occupation war criminals.
Furthermore, said the PFLP, it is the responsibility of the Palestinian leadership to de-legitimize the occupation state, hold it accountable for its criminal actions under international law, not to hold meetings that serve internal interests of parties of the occupation state.
The Front said that the national priorities of the Palestinian people must be put forward in national consensus, including all Palestinian forces and factions, including the Islamic forces (Hamas and Islamic Jihad) to build national unity, re-build the PLO to restore its position as the sole legitimate representative and reference of the Palestinian people everywhere they are, and consolidate its role as a national liberation movement to resist occupation and secure Palestinian rights to independence, Jerusalem, self-determination and return.
Comrade Jamil Mizher, member of the Central Committee of the PFLP, said that this meeting “takes us back to square one in the useless and harmful ‘negotiations’ conducted over many years, which have only formed a cover for the occupation as it commits crimes against our people and builds thousands of settlement units. We should not reward the occupation but instead pursue them, bring them to justice, and hold them accountable, including trying them in international courts as war criminals for their heinous crimes against the Palestinian people.”
Such meetings, said Mizher, “do not serve Palestinian interests but are about the internal conflicts in the government of the occupation, which includes many parties, and that the terrorist Mofaz, as leader of one of these parties, is seeking to bolster himself through this meeting.” He stressed the need to build a national strategy based on building common ground to meet the challenges of occupation and to achieve Palestinian national interests, not those of the occupation state and its racist political parties.
