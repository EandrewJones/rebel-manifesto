The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said that the imprisoned leader of the Front’s branch in occupation jails, Comrade Ahed Abu Ghoulmeh, was transferred on Wednesday morning, February 18th from Hadarim to Rimon prison.
This transfer follows the escalation of the occupation prison services against the Palestinian prisoners, as the prisoners intend to take steps in protest of these oppressive policies in the coming days.
Moreover, the Front noted that this transfer is an attempt to limit the impact of the Front’s leaders in the Zionist occupation jails, and their significant role in the unifying the Prisoners’ Movement in its just struggle against occupation prison authorities and its practices against the prisoners.
