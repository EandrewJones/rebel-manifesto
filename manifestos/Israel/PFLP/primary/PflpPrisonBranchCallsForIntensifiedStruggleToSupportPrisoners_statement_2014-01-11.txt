The branch of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in the occupation prisons called upon all Palestinian forces and factions to build a comprehensive and inclusive national framework to take up and lead the struggle on the ground to confront the occupation assaults against Palestinian prisoners and to activate all means to ensure their liberation.
In a statement released on January 11, the prison branch of the Front said that the current conditions within the occupation prisons must inspire a serious escalation in the forms and methods of mass action in support of the prisoners. The prison administration continues to escalate its methods of repression and attack against the Palestinian political prisoners.
The occupation continues its policy of medical neglect of prisoners as a method of punishment and revenge, said the Front, and it is re-activating the policy of solitary confinement and isolation. The latest Palestinian prisoner subject to this policy is the leader Ibrahim Hamed of al-Qassam Brigades.
These actions come in addition to continuing crack-downs on prisonersâ€™ families during visits, searching, harassing, and detaining them; the occupation has refused to improve the visit conditions for prisoners from Gaza and facilitate visits. Furthermore, occupation authorities are assaulting prisoners and planting surveillance cameras in Ramon prison.
The PFLP Prison Branch said that these practices of terror against the prisoners are a normal part of the ongoing policy of the occupation state against our people in general. They called for international action in order to expose the crimes against prisoners and to hold occupation authorities accountable in international courts.
