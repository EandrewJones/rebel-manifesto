The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine prison branch called for accuracy and caution in the Palestinian media in relation to the statements of imprisoned General Secretary, Comrade Ahmad Sa’adat, especially with regard to the position of the Front in relation to steps of struggle inside Israeli jails.
The General Secretary and the PFLP prison branch did not announce a position in relation to the declaration of an upcoming hunger strike by Fateh leader Marwan Barghouthi. The position of the PFLP prison branch and comrade Sa’adat is that any collective step of struggle should first be based on a national consensus strategy of the prisoners’ movement, strengthening its unity and involving all factions.
In this context, the PFLP prison branch, despite its appreciation and high regard for the declaration of the brother, struggler and Fateh leader Marwan Barghouthi and a group of Fateh prisoners to launch a strike on April 17, they did not build on these efforts to make a unified announcement of a strike with the participation of all factions. The official position of the PFLP prison branch is therefore not to participate in this step, with support for comrades who live in joint sections with the Fateh movement prisoners to participate in the strike that was announced by the Fateh prisoners.
The PFLP prison branch renewed its emphasis that any collective prisoners’ step of struggle should be national, unified and with the participation of all.
