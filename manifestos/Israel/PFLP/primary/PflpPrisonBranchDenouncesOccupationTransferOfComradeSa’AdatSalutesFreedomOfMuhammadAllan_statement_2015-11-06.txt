The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine’s branch in Israeli prisons reported that there has been a serious onslaught by the occupation prison management against Palestinian prisoners in the past several days, including the transfer of many prisoners from one prison to anther, including imprisoned General Secretary of the PFLP, Comrade Ahmad Sa’adat, who was transferred to Ramon Prison.
The Prison Branch noted that there is a state of tension in Nafha prison after prison guards broke into five sections, transferring all of the Palestinian prisoners to other prisons, and that the situation continues to escalate.
The PFLP Prison Branch said that the prisoners are being targeted because the prisoners’ movement represents a fundamental incubator of leadership of the Palestinian movement, which includes the various escalating steps of protest against the prison administration as well as the declaration from inside the prisons on behalf of the prisoners’ movement that all stand in support of the popular intifada, and urge its continuation and escalation.
The continued targeting of the Palestinian prisoners’ movement, and particularly its leadership, is a confirmation that the prisoners are an integral part of the struggles of our people, on the front line against occupation, said the Front’s prison branch.
In addition, the Popular Front expressed its sincere congratulations to the heroic prisoner Muhammad Allan and his family on the occasion of his precious freedom, won through his steadfastness and will through 64 days of hunger strike. The Front noted that the rally of the masses of our people to embrace Allan upon his moment of liberation is yet another confirmation of the presence of the issue and struggle of the prisoners at the center of the struggle of the Palestinian people.
