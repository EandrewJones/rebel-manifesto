The approval of the Zionist Knesset for a new law that attempts to impose restrictions on the release of Palestinian prisoners who have engaged in resistance operations including the killing of Israelis, comes in the framework of a systematic escalation against the Palestinian people, whether in Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza Strip, everywhere in Palestine, or inside Israeli jails, said the branch of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in occupation prisons.
The statement said that this new law will not have an effect on reality, noting that “experience has confirmed that the occupation always abandons these decisions and responds to the demands of the resistance forces in the exchange of captured Zionist soldiers held by the resistance with Palestinian prisoners held in occupation jails.”
“This decision may affect the so-called ‘goodwill measures’ between the Palestinian Authority and the occupation, under which prisoner releases are conducted for the resumption of the negotiations process, but this process has been widely criticized from the prisoners, who refuse to link their liberation with negotiations with the occupier,” said the Front.
The Front called for action to expose the occupation policies and laws of terror at all levels against the Palestinian prisoners, and emphasized the right of the Palestinian people to resist by all means, through wich the occupation will release Palestinian prisoners unconditionally despite any laws of the occupation state.
