The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine branch in Israeli jails called upon the Palestinian people and their political forces that it is time to reject the Oslo agreement and its consequences in total, and rebuild the PLO as a Palestinian framework on the basis of a resistance political program.
In an evaluation of current political events, they emphasized the importance of harnessing the lessons of over 20 years of Oslo, which has strengthened the occupation and held the Palestinian people hostage to its practices of aggression and subject to its security, political and economic hegemony, represented first and foremost by security coordination and the futile negotiations which lead to nothing but the occupation’s aggression against our people, including settlement construction, Judaization, land confiscation and siege.
It is long past time that the security commitments of Oslo are completely rejected; any Palestinian security force should defend the Palestinian people and confront the Zionist occupation and settlers, security coordination with the occupation is absolutely unacceptable.
National unity, the Front’s prison branch said, is critical to move beyond internal Palestinian division, and must be based on a national political program, or else any reconciliation agreement will merely be exploited to continue negotiations, security obligation, and submitting to Zionist and United States blackmail. Palestinian national reconciliation must mean the full revival of the resistance in all of its forms, including the political struggle in international forums for our legitimate rights, outside the abhorrent domination of the United States.
Furthermore, the prison branch of the Front called for concerted efforts to support the prisoners in the occupation prisons in various ways, emphasizing that the initiatives do not meet the sacrifices of the prisoners who are facing a serious battle with the Zionist occupation authorities who systematically disregard their rights.
