The branch of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in occupation prisons issued a statement on September 20, 2014, noting that the prisoners’ movement today is facing a fierce assault by the Zionist enemy and its mechanisms of repression, especially the Shin Bet and the Prison Service administration. These agencies are restricting prisoners’ lives, preventing visits, reducing the main staple foods for prisoners, enforcing arbitrary transfers and removing access to Arabic language television.
The prison administration’s crimes do not end here; it has also escalated the policy of medical neglect. All of these actions have been based on flimsy justifications related to the heroic struggle of our people in the Gaza Strip and the proud achievements of our people in the battles of the resistance forces, which taught the Zionist enemy a lesson they will never forget.
The systematic policy of repression practiced by the enemy had its inevitable outcome in the martyrdom of the heroic prisoner, Raed Jabari, in Eshel prison. We hold the Prison Administration and the Zionist state responsible for the heinous crime against the martyr Jabari and demand that officials be brought to justice for the crime they committed against this prisoner martyr and all prisoners. And we demand at the political level that Palestinian officials uphold their responsibility to protect the prisoners and the Palestinian people as a whole from the occupier and its racist policies by going to the International Criminal Court to prosecute the Zionist war criminals for their massacres against our people in the Gaza Strip. Furthermore, Palestinian officials must end their internal Palestinian battle of media statements that seek to accuse our people and our resistance over actions in Gaza while refusing to act to bring the occupation to justice for its heinous crimes against our people.
Long live free Palestine; long live the struggle of our people and their resistance
Salutes to the martyrs, healing for the wounded, freedom for the prisoners
