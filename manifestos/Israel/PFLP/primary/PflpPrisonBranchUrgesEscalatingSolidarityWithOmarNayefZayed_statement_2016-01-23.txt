The Prison Branch of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine expressed its full solidarity with Comrade Omar Nayef Zayed, stating that his case is a cause of all progressive forces in the world, which requires a serious stand to confront Zionist arrogance.
The Zionist attack on Palestinian strugglers around the world is a reflection of the bankruptcy of the occupier and its inability to achieve any true victories, seeking out fake accomplishments by persecuting activists all around the world.
However, any success by the occupation in achieving the arrest or extradition of Comrade Omar Nayef Zayed would be a dangerous precedent, noted the Prison Branch, calling for all official and popular forces and human rights organizations to uphold their responsibility, first and foremost the Palestine Liberation organization and all of its institutions and representatives, calling on the Palestinian embassy in Bulgaria to continue to protect Zayed and reject all forms of pressure to turn him over.
The Prison Branch also called for all forms of popular and official actions to support the case of Omar Nayef Zayed in Palestine and around the world by the friends of the Palestinian people and the supporters of their just cause, urging the escalation of the campaign as much as possible and the need to expose the crimes of the occupier in all official and popular international forums.
