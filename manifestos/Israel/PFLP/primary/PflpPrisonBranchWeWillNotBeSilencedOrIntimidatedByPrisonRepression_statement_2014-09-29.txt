The Zionist prison administration began a systematic campaign against the prisoners of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in various prisons several weeks ago, coinciding with an ongoing punitive campaign against the prisoners of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. This is being done by the prison authorities in order to undermine the organizing of PFLP prisoners and create a state of instability among the prisoners.
In various prisons, Zionist repressive forces broke into PFLP prisoners’ sections, ransacking their rooms, tampering with their belongings, confiscating electronic devices and damaging personal property, as well as preventing PFLP prisoners from accessing the canteen, confiscating televisions and removing access to Arabic language satellite channels.
In a further escalation, a number of PFLP prisoners’ family members were denied permits to visit their relatives inside the occupation prisons, who were informed that there is a formal decision to prevent visits to prisoners of the Front.
The prison branch of the PFLP reaffirms that these practices and campaigns are merely the latest attack in a long line of repression, will not intimidate us or suppress our struggle to achieve our rights and the demands of the prisoners. From Sunday, we will implement a series of steps to protest against these practices and abuses, up to a general strike carried out strategically with prisoners in all occupation prisons, in case the Zionist prison authorities do not back down on their unjust and repressive actions.
