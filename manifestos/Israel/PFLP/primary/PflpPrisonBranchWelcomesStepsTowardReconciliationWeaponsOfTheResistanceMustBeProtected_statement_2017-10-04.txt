The Prison Branch of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine issued the following statement:
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) welcomes the positive developments in reconciliation from inside the occupation prisons, and emphasized that the PA president must immediately reverse the punitive measures imposed on the Gaza Strip, warning of the negative repercussions of the continuing refusal to do so.
The organization said that all prisoners in the occupation jails are observing the recent developments in the reconciliation with great interests and hope that the implementation of the reconciliation agreements will protect the national and popular rights, emphasizing that they will stand with their people in support of national unity and their right to resist occupation by all available means.
The Prison Branch emphasized that the weapons of the resistance are always legitimate weapons and that any attempts to harm or confiscate such weapons violates the right of the Palestinian people to resistance. Therefore, any reconciliation must ensure the construction of a national strategy of struggle to manage the battle with the occupation and build a clear policy that rejects any compromise on the fundamental rights of our people to resist occupation and the legitimacy of their weapons.
The Front concluded its statement by emphasizing the need to overcome all obstacles to hold comprehensive elections to arrange the Palestinian house, especially the convening of the Palestinian National Council with the participation of all political colors of the Palestinian spectrum. The most important task is to rebuild the Palestine Liberation Organization on a new national and democratic foundation that can truly represent our people on a national basis in all of their places of residence, and to put in place a strategy to confront the occupation, its crimes and all of its projects that aim to end the Palestinian national existence as a whole.
