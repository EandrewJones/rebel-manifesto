Statement by the leadership of the PFLP Prison Branch:
The “Promise of al-Buraq” operation is a firm response to any attempt to undermine or concede Palestinian land, holy sites and rights
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine organization leadership in Israeli jails sends its greetings of pride to the heroes of the “Promise of al-Buraq” operation, the heroic PFLP comrades and former prisoners Bara’a Ibrahim Saleh Atta and Osama Ahmed Mustafa Atta, and the hero of al-Qassam, Adel Hassan Ahmed Ankoush, whose precious blood was shed to defend Jerusalem and its holy sites in a new epic of pride for the Palestinian people and the prisoners’ movement.
The PFLP prison branch organization joins the Palestinian masses, the Arab nation and the forces of freedom in the world in saluting the new constellation of heroes, the sons of the steadfast castle of Deir Abu Mashaal. They confirm that the “Promise of al-Buraq” operation came as a firm response to any attempt to compromise or give up Palestinian land, holy sites and rights or to seek to present them as credentials to the occupation and the White House as a sign of a loyal leader servile to the so-called “peace process.”
The operation also comes within the framework of confronting all schemes, projects and paths aimed at undermining Palestinian national rights and the liquidation of our national cause, affirming the conclusion that the spirit of revolution is rooted in the Palestinian youth and the energy of our mighty people does not subside in the face of all of the Zionist security matters. No matter the intensity of the repression of the intifada, the vanguard is able to penetrate the fortreses of Zionist security with the simplest of weapons to achieve more strength and mechanisms of struggle for our people.
This operation mandates greater national unity, cohesion and continuing to escalate the response to the brutal occupation forces and settler hordes, to use all methods and forms of resistance until the permanent defeat of the settlement project and its racist gang, and in order to achieve the goals of our people to return, liberation and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the entire land of Palestine with its unified and liberated capital in Jerusalem.
All salutes to the steadfastness of the heroic people of the village of Deir Abu Mashaal and all of our villages, camps and cities. We march forward under the command of the martyrs; victory is inevitable!
