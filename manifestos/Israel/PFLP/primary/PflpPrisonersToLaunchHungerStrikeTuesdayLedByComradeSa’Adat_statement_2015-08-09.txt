The prison branch of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine announced their plan to launch a hunger strike on Tuesday, August 11, following the ongoing Zionist raids and attacks on Palestinian political prisoners, including imprisoned PFLP General Secretary, Comrade Ahmad Sa’adat, and the renewed order denying family visits to Comrade Sa’adat.
PFLP prisoners in all Zionist prisons will launch their strike on Tuesday morning. They will launch their strike amid an atmosphere of confrontation and struggle in the prisons, where prisoners from fellow Palestinian factions and political forces are also waging hunger strikes to resist the Zionist attacks on the achievements and rights of the prisoners won through struggle and resistance over decades.
The PFLP Prison Branch statement:
The prison branch of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, headed by national leader Ahmad Sa’adat, will launch an open hunger strike on Tuesday [11 August], following a stalemate in the negotiations with the Prison administration, brought about by the Prison Service’s intransigence in response to the just demands of the prisoners. In addition, today a military order was issued extending the security prohibition against leader Sa’adat, denying him family visits for an additional three months.
The prison branch confirmed that the Front’s prisoners, led by Sa’adat, have decided to fight a long and difficult battle with the occupation which is not conditioned by any covenants or undertakings, after exhausting all options in order to impel the occupier to respond to the demands of the prisoners.
The PFLP prisoners called on the masses of our people, the Arab and Muslim communities and countries, and the forces of justice and freedom in the world to provide the widest support and solidarity to the struggle of the prisoners’ national movement in the battles of confrontation and steadfastness they are waging around the clock against the prison and intelligence officials of the occupation. The breadth and depth of solidarity gives prisoners inspiration to continue the struggle until their rights are achieved in full.
The imprisoned comrades will strike to demand an end to the prohibitions on family visits for Palestinian prisoners including the orders against Comrade Ahmad Sa’adat; and to demand medical care for sick prisoners, an end to the policy of administrative detention, improvements in conditions inside the prisons and a ban on invasions and raids by Zionist special units against the prisoners.
