The Prisoners’ Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine expressed its full solidarity with the Hamas prisoners in Nafha prison who are facing a campaign of attacks and repression by the prison administration, which has stormed the prisoners’ sections, transferring dozens to other prisons, and isolating the leadership of the Hamas prisoners in Israeli jails.
The Prisoners’ Committee considered that this attack comes amid the ongoing abuses of the Zionist prison administration against the prisoners’ movement in general, as well as attacks on the prisoners of the Front, and share a common goal of attempting to suppress the movement and the struggle of imprisoned Comrade Bilal Kayed and his open hunger strike, and to create a situation of chaos and multiple secondary struggles that divert attention from the prisoners’ demands.
The Prisoners’ Committee expressed its confidence and solidarity to the Hamas prisoners for their determination to continue the battle and confront all of the schemes of the prison administration, including the case of Bilal Kayed and the administrative detention.
The Prisoners Commission called for the prisoners’ movement to continue their collective action and unite all efforts to confront the crimes of the Zionist prison administration and enhance the pressure to free Comrade Bilal Kayed. The statement of the prisoners’ movement of July 12 provides a fertile ground for the prisoners’ movement to actively unite behind bars to confront the attacks of the prison administration and support Comrade Bilal Kayed as his battle is the struggle of all prisoners, not an individual or isolated struggle only.
