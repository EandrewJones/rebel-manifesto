The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine reaffirms its support for teachers and their legitimate right to protest for their rights and for redress like all workers, and to live a decent life worthy of their status and the value of teachers and education to our society.
The Popular Front noted that the Palestinian Authority government of Rami Hamdallah carries responsibility for the continuing nature of this crisis, which could have been solved by immediately applying in full the results of the 2013 agreement with the teachers, and with a commitment to dialogue with teachers around their legitimate demands. Instead, teachers were met with hurled accusations of political machinations and attempts to foce them to accept partial demands that do not reflect even their minimal rights.
The Front denounced the harassment and attempts to intimidate and threaten teachers, which have contributed to the escalation over the past seceral days. Furthermore, this issue has revealed clearly to all the absence of clear, transparent and fair fiscal policy by the Authority, which directs a massive portion of the budget to security sectors at the expense of education, infrastructure and social affairs.
The threat of the government to fire teachers and replace them with volunteers or replacement workers is unacceptable and absurd, violates Palestinian law, and only deepens the crisis. Furthermore, the Front expressed its complete rejection of the PA governmentâ€™s attempt to ban demonstrations, which violates Palestinian and international law which protect freedom of opinion and expression and the right to peaceful protest. Such actions only prove that the PA and its security forces are engaged in repressive policies and practices because of their own refusal to recognize the rights of teachers and instead using the option of police against them.
