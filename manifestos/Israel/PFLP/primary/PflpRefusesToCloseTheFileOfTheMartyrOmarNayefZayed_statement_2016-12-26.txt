Commenting on the closure of the file of the case of the martyr Comrade Omar Nayef Zayed by the Bulgarian authorities, considering his killing a “suicide,” the PFLP rejected this action and stated that it was an action by the Bulgarian authorities in response to Israeli pressure.
The Front confirmed that it will continue to pursue the assassination of Comrade Nayef Zayed and will pursue all those involved in this crime, either directly or through complicity and negligence. It demanded the Bulgarian authorities asume their responsibility to uncover the evidence of the crime, especially since there is external information highlighting the responsibility of the Israeli Mossad. This is also indicated in the Israeli newspaper Maariv, which noted among recent achievements of the Mossad the case of Comrade Nayef Zayed in Bulgaria as well as the assassination of the Tunisian martyr Mohammed Zouari.
