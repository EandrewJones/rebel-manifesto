Palestine – 10/6/2003- A spokesperson for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-PFLP commented on President Arafat declaration of the State of Emergency and the formation of Emergency Government with the following statement:
As the Israeli aggression continues against our people, backed completely by the US administration, with its latest aggression against Palestinian refugees in Syria, the Israeli deceleration on continuing to build the Apartheid racist wall, the establishment of hundreds of new settlement units, and the continuation of assassinations and invasions across Palestinian areas.
As all of this takes place, the declaration of the state of emergency and the formation of the emergency government do not meet the Palestinian immediate needs. The Palestinian immediate needs call for the formation of a Unified National Leadership with the participation of all active political forces and can function as the highest legitimate representation for our people, and can also be the sole leadership that represents the unity of the people and strengthen our resistance and steadfastness in the battle against our enemy and its plans.
The Israeli right wing government is carrying out more crimes against our people, practicing the worst forms of State-Terror, and blatantly rejecting all UN resolutions, denying us our basic human and national rights. Therefore, it is a harmful illusion for the PA to keep running after deceitful promises, giving away more concessions, insisting on the undemocratic decision making and the concentration of power in the hands of the PA. Such actions are harmful to the Palestinian internal unity. Instead, we call for a unified national political agenda, which strengthens our internal front, unifies our political discourse and protects the national rights of our people under a unified leadership capable of responding to the necessities of this stage in our struggle.
