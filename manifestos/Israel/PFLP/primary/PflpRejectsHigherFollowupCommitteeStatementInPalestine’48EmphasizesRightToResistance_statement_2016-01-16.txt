The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine expressed its rejection of the condemnation of the Tel Aviv operation by the Chair of the Higher Follow-Up Committee for the Arab people in occupied Palestine 1948.
The Front emphasized that it is possible and indeed necessary to reject the pressures of the occupation and reject such statements, and instead insist on the right of our people to resist occupation in all forms. In particular, the PFLP noted that the description of the Tel Aviv operation as “criminal” is a dangerous precedent that paves the way to condemning any and all Palestinian resistance operations.
The Front rejected the content of the statement that sought to create a conflict or opposition between this operation and the struggle of our people against the Zionist occupation and its policies, noting that the systematic and continuous practices and war crimes of the occupation against our people are legitimate justifications for the continuation of resistance and response to the crimes of the occupation.
