The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine praised the resistance operation against the racist criminal, Yehuda Glick, a Zionist extremist leader in the heart of Jerusalem, saying it was an important action in breaking the Zionist plan of security in the city, and a blow against all the colonial settlers who practice constant violence and aggression against the people and neighborhoods of the city.
The occupation is continuing to target the city of Jerusalem and its people, kill its children, and desperately attempts to ethnically cleanse the city through changing the “facts on the ground,” said the Front. The occupation continues to attempt to undermine and attack Al-Aqsa Mosque and Palestinian holy places, and assumes that our people will remain silent and that these ongoing crimes will pass unnoticed. “Jerusalem has been, still is, and will remain a center for steadfastness, confrontation of the occupation, and intifada,” said the Front.
The Front warned against any actions by the Zionist occupation against the rights of the Palestinian people of Jerusalem, saying that attacks will be met with the resistance of our people against the occupation and the settlers.
The Front urged the Palestinian people, especially in the West Bank and the 1948 occupied lands of Palestine, and everywhere they are, to act and organize for victory for Jerusalem and its people, the escalation of the uprising and the targeting and isolation of the occupier in support of our people in Jerusalem, and in order to alleviate the siege and targeting against the people of the city.
The Front demanded that the Palestinian officials immediately end security coordination with the occupier and stop making statements that undermine the determination of the Palestinian people and tarnish the resistance to occupation.
The martyr Moataz Hijazi is a hero of the people. He was assassinated by Zionist forces, and his blood is fuel that further ignites the uprising to confront the occupying entity everywhere until the liberation of the entire land of Palestine.
