It came as no surprise that the Zionist occupation government refused to implement the agreement to release the fourth group of veteran prisoners held in the occupation prions since before the implementation of the Oslo agreement. The prisoners are being used for political blackmail and have been owed their freedom for twenty years.
Continuing to mortgage the release of five thousand prisoners and detainees including hundreds of administrative detainees, sick prisoners, and children, to negotiations means that their fate will be linked to the very political concessions rejected by the prisoners.
Accordingly, we call upon Palestinian officials and the Palestinian Authority to review its policies and refuse to rely on the negotiations for the release of prisoners, and instead immediately go to international institutions, in particular international courts and human rights bodies, to demand the prosecution of the Zionist leaders for their continued crimes and violations of the rights of our people and demand the release of all prisoners as prisoners of war.
Experience has shown that the liberation of prisoners has come as a result of the adoption of the resistance option for their release. As we call attention to the needs of the prisoners and their families and the national and Islamic forces expand their efforts for international solidarity, we must take up all means to win their release.
Freedom for the prisoners; glory to the martyrs; victory is inevitable.
