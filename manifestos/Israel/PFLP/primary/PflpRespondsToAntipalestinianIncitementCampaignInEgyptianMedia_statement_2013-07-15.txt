The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine issued the following statement in response to Egyptian media campaigns of incitement against the Palestinian people:
In light of the ongoing campaign of deliberate distortion and disinformation against the Palestinian people being waged on various satellite channels, newspapers and social networking sites in Egypt, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palesstien emphasizes the following:
First, we reaffirm our respect for the absolute right of the Egyptian people to exercise their will and determine their political choices without external interference. Egyptian politics is an Egyptian sphere, and no party is entitled to intervene under justifications of ideology or otherwise.
Second, we emphasize the depth of historical and national ties between the Palestinian people who suffer the ravages of occupation and siege, and our brother Egyptian people, who sacrificed for the cause of Palestine, which has always been a key issue in the consciousness and conscience of the Egyptian people.
Third, we strongly condemn the incitement campaign that deliberately broadcasts rumours and false reports and confirm that the historical relationship, blessed by the blood of the martyrs of our two peoples, is stronger than misinformation and deception, and demand the media be accurate, objective, and refrain from publishing material that is not based on evidence.
Fourth, the Front deeply appreciates the political forces and Egyptian intellectuals who signed the appeal “On the Position of the Palestinian Cause and Palestinian People,” and calls upon all Egyptian writers to respond to this campaign against the abuse of the relationship between our peoples.
Fifth, we call upon the Egyptian state to take all measures to mitigate the harm against our people, and in particular to open the Rafah Crossing and facilitate the traffic of people and goods.
Finally, we reaffirm our commitment to the safety and stability of our sister, Egypt, and wish that it regain its leadership role on the regional and international level. Long live free Arab Egypt, long live the struggle of the Palestinian people for liberation, return and self-determination.
