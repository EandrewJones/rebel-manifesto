The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine saluted the heroic operation carried out by the Palestinian fighter, Amjad Sukkari Abu Omar, at Beit El checkpoint, from Jammaâ€™in village near Nablus, and called on all strugglers in Palestine to escalate the flame of the intifada, saying that intifada is an irreversible choice of the people.
The Front, noting that the martyr was a staff sergeant in the Palestinian Authority police, said that all security coordination projects have proven to be failures and will fall in the hands of the Palestinian people. The Front also emphasized the need for a comprehensive review of the Palestinian security services to provide security for the Palestinian people and not the occupier, saying that the Beit El operation is a slap in the face of security coordination with the occupation.
