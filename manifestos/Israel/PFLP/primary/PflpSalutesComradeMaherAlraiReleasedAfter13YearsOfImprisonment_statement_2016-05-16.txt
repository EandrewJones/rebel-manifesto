Comrade Maher al-Rai (“Abu Giap”) was released from occupation prisons on May 11 after 13 years imprisonment, during which he was transferred from one prison to another repeatedly. He was greeted by a large crowd of leaders and cadres of the Front, family members, and friends and supporters, who led a procession to the city of Qalqilya.
The imprisoned General Secretary of the PFLP, Comrade Ahmad Sa’adat, and his comrades in the PFLP’s prison branch, alongside the cadres and members of the Front in occupied Qalqilya and throughout Occupied Palestine expressed their strongest congratulations to the comrade on his day of freedom.
Comrade Al-Rai belonged since he was a boy to the PFLP and was arrested several times by occupation forces, the first time in 1985 on charges of membership in the Front. He was arrested again for six months in 1989 and then held in administrative detention for another six months, and again in 1991 held in administrative detention. He was imprisoned for 10 months in 1995 pending trial for membership in the Front and was released as part of the Oslo agreement process, without signing the agreement to withdraw from struggle.
In the second Intifada, he struggled alongside his comrades in the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades and other resistance groups against the Zionist invasion and was injured with three bullets to the hand and chest. He was chased down by occupation forces in 2003 and seized and sentenced to 13 years imprisonment.
Throughout his time in prison he joined his comrades and fellow prisoners in protests and strikes of the prisoners’ movement and suffered several injuries as a result of repressive attacks on prisoners.
Sa’adat and the PFLP Prison Branch emphasized that the sun of freedom will inevitably rise for all Palestinian prisoners with their determination, steadfastness and resistance as part of the liberation struggle of the Palestinian people.
