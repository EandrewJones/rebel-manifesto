The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine salutes the memory of Vietnamese national hero, General Vo Nguyen Giap, who died at the age of 102. General Giap led the military strategy of the Vietnamese war of liberation from 1955-1975.
Giap was the first military commander to defeat a Western colonial power in Asia, and his legacy is renowned not only by the Vietnamese people but by all peoples around the world and all movements for liberation from colonialism and imperialism.
Giap’s development of guerilla tactics in Vietnam inspired liberation fighters and resistance movements around the world, including in Palestine. He is quoted as having said, “The Vietnamese and Palestinian people have much in common, just like two people suffering from the same illness.”
Giap’s legacy of resistance, commitment to liberation and mobilization of armed struggle in service of the people continues to inspire generations who fight for liberation.
