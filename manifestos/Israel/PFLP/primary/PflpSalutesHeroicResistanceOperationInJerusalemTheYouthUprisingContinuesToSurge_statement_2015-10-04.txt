The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine saluted the heroic resistance action in the occupied city of Jerusalem, carried out by the young martyr Muhannad Halabi of Al-Bireh, saying that this action is again proof that the will of our people is stronger than the tyranny of occupation, and will break the blockade and the chains of security and destruction imposed by the occupier on the sacred city.
The Front views this upsurge in Palestinian resistance operations against the occupation and the settlers, whether organizational or individual, as a confirmation that our people are determined to confront and respond to crimes of the occupation and will not back down from the right to resist and will continue to struggle until the achievement of their objectives.
The Front emphasized that the uprising of youth who are struggling for the sake of the homeland and to defend the Arab identity of Jerusalem, are imposing significant losses on the Zionist enemy and planting fear in the hearts of the occupying soldiers and settlers who are unable to cope with the high courage and spirit of these young people, armed with determination, persistence and the justice of their cause.
The Front called for the youth uprising to continue its strikes on Israeli soldiers and settlers with stones and Molotov cocktails, knives and all within reach of your hands. The enemy is cowardly and cannot bear losses and fears the language of the force of the oppressed.
The Front also salutes the night watch committees that confront the settlers attempting to invade villages and burn trees, calling for more of them to be formed throughout the occupied West Bank to confront the crimes of the occupation and settler terror.
