The Popular Front for the Liberation praised the heroic resistance operation of Beit Furik, Nablus, which led to the death of two Zionist settler colonists, noting that this resistance is a natural reaction to the escalating crimes of the occupation and the settlers against our people.
The Front confirmed that this resistance operation dealt a meaningful blow to the occupation and demonstrated the continuing ability of our people to fight back and seek justice for the blood of the martyrs Hadeel al-Hashlamoun and the Dawabsheh family, and also confirmed that the escalating occupation attempts to suppress the popular uprising and revolution of the stones raging in the streets and alleys of Jerusalem has failed also in the occupied West Bank.
The PFLP called on the resistance factions throughout the West Bank to intensify their strikes against the fascist entity with all means available, and prepare for a long battle; the resistance is the most effective means to secure our rights and freedom from the occupier.
The Front also called on the Palestinian security services to integrate with our people to defend them from the settlers and support the uprising and struggle, and for the development of popular committees to defend the Palestinian people and confront the colonizersâ€™ crimes.
