The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine saluted the three martyrs of al-Khalil city this morning, Wassem Jaber, Amir Fuad al-Juneidi, and Yousef Tarayra, saying that their struggle requires all of us to live up to their great sacrifice and move forward in escalating the Intifada and rejecting all attempts to stop its progress.
The recent Zionist escalation against our people in recent days, which takes many forms in the West Bank, in Jerusalem, in Gaza and in Occupied Palestine 48, reveals the extent of the confusion of the Zionist entity and its inability to cope with the growing intifada and uprising of the youth. It makes a practice of collective punishment, the escalation of repression, field executions, the demolition of homes and the attacks on the families of the martyrs, mass arrests, economic war on Palestinian products and preventing them from entering Jerusalem, assuming that these measures will quell the uprising.
The Front also considered that the pronouncement by chief Zionist rabbi Yitzhak Yosef, calling for the murder of every Palestinian carrying a knife, only illustrates the racist and fascist nature of the Zionist entity and its killing of women, men, children and elders.
The Front called for all national efforts and resources to form a solid wall of support for the intifada, and to protect and enhance the steadfastness of the Palestinian people, and adopt a unified national political program of resistance, to mobilize and build our alliances on popular and official Arab, regional and international levels.
