The victory of the Greek people in rejecting all of the terms of humiliation and austerity is not only one for the Greek people, but to the global working class and marginalized and oppressed peoples around the world who reject the domination and tyranny of imperialism, globalization and capitalism, said Dr. Rabah Muhanna, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
The Greek people’s OXI (NO) vote in rejecting the terms of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund in addressing the Greek economic crisis is a notable event in the struggle to confront colonialist and capitalist power and their international system of globalization, said Muhanna.
“The referendum vote of the Greek people yesterday, who rejected the EU conditions, domination and tyranny by a vote of 61% in response to the referendum called by the government of the leftist Syriza party offers an important and qualitative step forward for our global struggle of oppressed peoples,” Muhanna said.
