The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine welcomed the heroic operation carried out by Hezbollah against the Israeli army patrol in southern Lebanon, which underscores its ability to respond to attacks, and salutes the will and the courage of the resistance forces in confronting the enemy and its presence in Palestine and anywhere in Arab lands.
Beyond being a response to the assassination of six Hezbollah fighters by the Zionist military, the Front said, this operation is an expression of the commitment to continued resistance. The Front also renewed its call for a unified resistance force in Palestine and the Arab world to resist occupation and colonialism.
The National and Islamic forces in Palestine held a press conference in support of the Lebanese resistance and its operation on January 28, saying that this action demonstrates the strength of the resistance, and calling for a unified resistance fron to confront the Zionist occupation at all times.
