The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine praised the heroic battle of the resistance struggler, Mohammed al-Faqih, which lasted for hours and held off the occupation forces despite their numbers and military machine, directing sincere condolences to the Palestinian people on the martyrdom of this resistance struggle.
The Front emphasized that the martyr Mohammed al-Faqih belongs to a generation of resistance and refusal to meekly accept the status quo imposed by the Zionist occupation and its policy of terror, home demolitions, and massacres, amid Arab and international silence. The Front urged the continuing of his path of resistance, noting that the continued sacrifice of Palestinian youth confirms that the resistance is rooted in the hearts and minds of the Palestinian people and cannot be erased or repressed by the terror of the occupier.
The Front confirmed that this heroic battle comes in response to all those who would undermine resistance, the lackeys of reactionary Arab regimes and the patrons of normalization. This hero continued to resist, armed with will, determination, and conviction, at a time when these regimes stockpile tanks, planes, and weaponry used only to kill the women, children and elders of the Arab peoples.
The resistance of the Palestinian people continues, in open confrontation with the criminal enemy. We recall and salute the resisters, Moataz Hijazi, Moataz Washahe, and Mohammed al-Faqih, and all the heroes of our people, who remain torches illuminating the path to liberation and return.
