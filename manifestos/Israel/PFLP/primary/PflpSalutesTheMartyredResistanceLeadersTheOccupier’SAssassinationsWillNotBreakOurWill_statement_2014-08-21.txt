The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine joins the masses of our people and the Arab nation in mourning three of the most prominent leaders of the Brigades of the Martyr Izzedine al-Qassam, the martyrs Mohammed Abu Shamala, Raed al-Attar and Mohammed Barhoum, who were martyred with a number of our people on Thursday, August 21 in intensive Zionist raids which targeted a full residential block in the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood in Rafah city, Gaza, Palestine.
Palestine and Gaza have lost three of the greatest leaders of the resistance in Gaza at the hands of the enemy. Over the years, they caused great woes for the Zionist enemy and were responsible for a large number of quality military operations, and who always worked together with other resistance factions, in operations including the capture of the Zionist soldier Gilad Shalit, for whom over a thousand of our political prisoners were released and the development of the tunnels on the edge of the Gaza Strip from which Palestinian resistance fighters inflicted serious blows on the enemy.
The martyred leaders of the resistance in Rafah today join their predecessors, the martyred leaders Mohammed al-Aswad (“Guevara Gaza”), Wadie Haddad, Salah Shehadeh, Abu Jamal Abu Samhadana, Jihad al-Ammarin, Khaled Dahdouh and other resistance leaders who took up the commandment of resistance and gave their lives for the freedom of their land and people.
The martyrdom of the leaders in Rafah today will not break our will and will only increase our commitment and determination to continue the struggle and confrontation, adhere to the choice of resistance, and motivate the resistance factions and their military wings to attack the occupier everywhere.
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine extends its deepest condolences to the brothers in the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) on the martyrdom of its leaders, and to the bereaved families in Rafah attacked in the bombing of Tal al-Sultan. We vow to continue the resistance and the goals for which these martyrs struggled, until the achievement of the liberation of our people, the expulsion of the occupier, the return of the refugees and the establishment of our independent Palestine on the entire land of historic Palestine.
Glory to the martyrs…Victory is inevitable
