The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine salutes the masses of the Palestinian people in the West Bank, in Jerusalem, and occupied Palestine ’48 as they take qualitative actions and embody steadfastness and popular intifada and confront the occupier. This is the true picture of our people, their will and their commitment, which cannot and will not be defeated by Zionist crimes, the conditions of the moment, Arab complicity and international collusion against the Palestinian people and cause.
The Front saluted the escalating heroic operations against Israeli soldiers and settlers in occupied Palestine, especially in the West Bank and Jerusalem, noting that this is an expected response to the crimes of the occupation and that resistance is the most effective method to defend our people against the systematic Zionist war on their existence.
The Front noted the role of liberated prisoners in these heroic operations as an indication of the fact the the prisons of the occupation have been and continue to be schools to produce revolutionary heroism and sacrifice, which is a major component of our Palestinian people and their struggle against the occupation.
The PFLP noted the Israeli Ministerial Committee’s approval of proposed legislation applying Israeli law to the settlers in the West Bank as a serious development and an attempt to impose “facts on the ground” and annex the West Bank settlements to the occupation state.
The Front also denounced the recent ocucpation actions, especially the attempt to destroy Palestinian homes in Jerusalem and declare them “illegal” and the campaign of incitement against our people in occupied Palestine ’48, the demolition of the homes of the families of those who carry out operations against the occupiers, and the escalation of settlement construction, as revealing the true racist face of state terror that is inveighed against our people in occupied Palestine. They are confronting malicious attempts to break their will and force them to surrender and submission.
The Front urged the masses of our people in every part of Palestine to continue and escalate the popular struggle to an overwhelming popular intifada against the Israeli occupation, and for our people in the Diaspora to escalate their support for the struggle inside.
The Front also demanded that the Palestinian Authority and its security forces adopt a national stance to serve the people, by ending security coordination and any ties with the criminal occupier, and instead change the function of the security agencies to provide security to our people to protect them from Zionist attacks, and confront Israeli policy and practices based on a comprehensive national strategy that ends negotiations with the occupation state and prioritizes national unity.
The PFLP renewed its call for the formation of popular protection committees to confront the attacks by settlers against our people. The Front also called for an urgent meeting of the provisional leadership of the Palestinian national movement and the PLO, including all factions, to discuss the escalating Zionist aggression, and develop a unified national plan to support the steadfastness of our people and their intifada in the face of the occupation, and for the Palestinian official leadership to immediately join the International Criminal Court to prosecute the occupation for its escalating crimes against our people.
The Front called upon the Arab people and international allies and friends around the world to escalate comprehensive boycott against the occupation and expose the practices and violations of Zionism.
