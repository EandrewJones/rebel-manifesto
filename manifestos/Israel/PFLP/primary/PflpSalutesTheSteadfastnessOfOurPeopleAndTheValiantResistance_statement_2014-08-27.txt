On the occasion of the ceasefire in Gaza, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine extends its strongest salutes to the resilient Palestinian masses, to the steadfast resistance factions, and to the heroic and courageous resistance fighters who fought with unmatched courage to repel the aggression and defeat its objectives, who have elevated the Palestinian cause as a national liberation struggle and who protect our national rights which the occupier has made every attempt to liquidate over the previous years.
The Resistance protects and defends the dignity of our people, which has never faltered despite the massive assault of the occupier, the vast destruction of buildings and institutions, the killing and wounding of thousands of our people, and the suffering and displacement of hundreds of thousands of our people.
The PFLP emphasizes the role of the resistance in the battlefield in realizing these achievements, and the cohesion between the resistance and the masses of the people. We call for the consolidation and development of this resistance unity, to achieve true national unity aside from factional rivalries, which was and remains a wedge to weaken our people and fragment their energies and abilities. On this basis, we urge the full adherence to the terms of the unified delegation and the resistance to end the aggression, and warn that the enemy must not be allowed to exploit the cease-fire to escape from these terms, as we know that the Zionist entity will work to prolong the negotiations and limit the gains achieved by our people in their resistance to its aggression.
Salutes to the immortal martyrs of our people, salutes and wishes for a speedy recovery to our heroic wounded, salutes to our steadfast and resilient people, who will march and carry their flag high until full victory is achieved for Palestine, our land and our people.
