The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine saluted the heroic successive resistance actions carried out by Palestinian young people in uprising. The Front emphasized that these resistance actions in Jerusalem, Yafa and Tel Aviv prove once again that the intifada continues, and is building its achievements, and is moving toward a turning point of greater momentum that is deeply disruptive to the occupation and its normalcy.
The Front added that the youth of the intifada, with their blood, sacrifice, will and determination in their ability to penetrate the Zionist security system inside the occupying entity, are escalating their resistance against the heinous crimes of the occupation against our people.
In order to honor the sacrifice of these heroes, and all of the martyrs of Palestine, it requires all to assume their responsibilities to support and protect the intifada and formulate a political program in order to encourage its growth.
