The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine confirmed that the occupation forces’ siege on the city of Al-Khalil and the closure of its entrances wll not defeat the residents of the city or weaken its resistance, and will not bring security to the settlers.
The Front stated that the Zionist cabinet’s measures and sanctions against the city of Al-Khalil reflects their disarray and obvious inability to stop the Palestinian resistance, which continues to live in the city of al-Khalil.
The Zionist enemy will know very well that all of these escalating attacks against the people of al-Khalil will not maintain the security of the settlements or stop the Palestinian resistance.
The Front confirmed that the blockade of al-Khalil and its isolation, the demolition of the homes of the martyrs, and the attacks on the Palestinian people collectively in the West Bank and Jerusalem, and the construction of more settlement homes, are all war crimes; but that the Front does not fear for the city of al-Khalil, because its people are firmly capable of resisting the occupation and the settlers and their crimes, until return and liberation.
