The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the adoption by Netanyahu’s cabinet of the so-called “Jewish nation-state” bill as a renewed declaration of war on the historical and civil rights of the Palestinian people inside 1948 occupied Palestine.
It reflects the overt racism of the state, and attempts to “legalize and legitimize” the existing policies of discrimination, racism and oppression that have been attacking our people for the past 66 years. This is part and parcel of a strategy to pave the way for further collective expulsions, continuing Nakba, and the ongoing Judaization of Palestinian land, the Front noted.
One of the objectives of this bill is to falsely portray the occupation state’s seizure of land and expansion of colonies, annexation of Jerusalem, division of Al-Aqsa mosque, undermining of Muslim and Christian holy sites, and crimes in Jerusalem and throughout Palestine as a “religious conflict” or “religious struggle,” noted the Front
The Front called for confronting this racist legislation by escalating the level of confrontation with the racist state at all levels, on the Palestinian, Arab and international fronts. In particular, the Front noted, it is critical to build a national strategy to protect the rights of the Palestinian people and emphasize the nature of the Palestinian cause as one of a national democratic liberation struggle against a settler colonial racist state, and to quickly accede to international treaties and conventions, particularly the International Criminal Court, to prosecute the leaders of the occupation state for their crimes. In addition, the Front emphasized the importance of the continuing and growing movement to boycott and isolate the occupation state at all levels and strip it of its façade of legitimacy.
