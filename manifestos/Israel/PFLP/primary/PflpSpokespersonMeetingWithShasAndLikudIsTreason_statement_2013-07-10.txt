A spokesperson for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine sharply condemned the meeting that took place in Ramallah between Palestinian officials, including Yasser Abed Rabbo, Nabil Sha’ath, Muhammad Madani and others; with Israeli political figures from the notoriously racist Shas and Likud parties.
The PFLP spokesperson said that this meeting should be considered treason against the Palestinian people and their national cause.
The spokesperson also said that this meeting could not have taken place without the consent of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, and that he must be held responsible.
He also said that this meeting only confirms that the current Palestinian leadership has reached a dead end on the path of negotiations, warning against this and similar “back door” negotiations attempts. Furthermore, he warned against any indication that this meeting signifies Palestinian acquiescence to illegal colonial settlements in the West Bank. The spokesperson also noted that the meeting took place under the auspices of the so-called Geneva Initiative, a group that has been trying for ten years to pressure Palestinians to negotiate away the right of return.
Abed Rabbo and Sha’ath do not represent the Palestinian people and do not speak on our behalf; they do not represent the position of the Palestinian people, said the Front’s spokesperson, warning that continuing on the dangerous path of illusions will only lead to more Palestinian political fragmentation.
The PFLP is currently discussing further steps to respond to this situation.
