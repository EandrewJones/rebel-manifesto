The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine expressed its full solidarity with Venezuela in confronting US sanctions aimed at overthrowing the democratic Bolivarian government of Venezuela and undermining the will of its people, who have continually resisted US capitalism and imperialism.

The US is making clear its ongoing and continuous policy seeking to return Venezuela under the boot of US imperialism and the dictates of US policy, as was the case in the past before the Bolivarian Revolution and the election of the late President Hugo Chavez. The Front expressed its solidarity with the people of Venezuela, the government and the President, Nicolas Maduro, in continuing to resist such attempts to undermine the future of Venezuela’s popular development.
Comrade Kayed al-Ghoul, member of the Political Bureau of the PFLP, urged all progressive and democratic movements in the world to stand with Venezuela, noting the mass support of the people – and governments – of Latin America for Venezuela’s self-determination and sovereignty, rejecting and resisting the US attempt to isolate the Bolivarian Republic for its leading role in Latin America and the world in rejecting US imperialism.
Al-Ghoul added that the Front is confident that Venezuela will continue to be a thorn in the side of US capitalism and global hegemony, and a country and people who consistently stand by the side of the Palestinian people and all peoples who stand for liberation and resistance to US imperialism, which pursues global policies of plunder, exploitation, underdevelopment, occupation, war and subjugation against the peoples and oppressed nations of the world in order to further its interests.
