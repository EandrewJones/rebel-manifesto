The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine strongly condemned the decision of the major administrative court in Bahrain to dissolve the National Democratic Action Society – Wa’ad and the liquidation of its funds. The Front expresses its full solidarity with Wa’ad, its leadership and its bases inside and outside Bahrain and demanded immediate reversal of this decision.
This political action is dangerous and harmful and in no way serves the interests of claimed desires for stability or reform in the country. Instead, it only exacerbates political, social and economic injustice in Bahrain and pours oil on the fire.
The Front emphasized that Wa’ad is an authentic and integral part of the Bahraini people’s movement, with a national and progressive vision as part of the Arab liberation movement and a democratic force of change. It dedicates its efforts and struggle to the achievement of democracy, equality, political pluralism, social justice and the authentic rights of the Bahraini people. It confronts the violations and practices of the Bahraini security system and its agents.
The Front further considered that the insistence of the Bahraini state on this political decision is a blatant attack on the Bahraini people and their legitimate rights. It is not only a violation of the freedom of association and expression but on the entire Arab national liberation movement of which the Wa’ad association is part. This movement is characterized by its principled position on Arab issues, including the liberation of Palestine, and acts to confront Arab normalization with the Zionist entity, especially in the Gulf region.
