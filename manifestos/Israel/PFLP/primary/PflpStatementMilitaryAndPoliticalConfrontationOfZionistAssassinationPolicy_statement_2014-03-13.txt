The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine called for response to confront the Zionist escalation and a comprehensive political and military national strategy, first to end security coordination, put a stop to the negotiations and resist pressure from the U.S. administration and the Zionist enemy.
The last two days have witnessed the escalation of the Israeli assassination policy practiced by the Zionist army against Palestinins, most recently in the assassination of three fighters of the Al-Quds Brigades – Ismael Abu Joudah, Shaher Abu Shanab, and Abdel Shafi Muammar – southeast of Khan Younis, Fidaa Majadleh west of Tulkarem, the assassination of Comrade Saji Darwish east of Ramallah, and the martyrdom of Judge Raed Zuaiter while passing from Jordan to Palestine.
This escalation in the attacks on Palestinians in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is a continuation of the continuous and unchanging policy of the Zionist enemy – violence and murder as the one means to deal with the Palestinian people, exploiting internal division and confusion amid the Arab situation in order to achieve its goals, in particular to push Palestinian officials to concede to U.S. and Zionist demands, and to continue negotiations based on the same conditions annd with no Israeli obligations.
In addition it is clear that the Zionist concept of truce means utterly ending the resistance against the occupation forces and settlers while at the same time “Israel” upholds its “absolute right” to continue aggression, assassination, settlements and other attacks against the Palestinian people and land. The Front called upon parties committed to truce to re-examine their position and to adopt an alternative unified resistance to the occupation and its aggression in order to achieve gains on the path toward the defeat of the occupier and the achievement of freedom, self-determination and return for our people.
