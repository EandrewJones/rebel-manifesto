The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades join the masses of our people in mourning our comrade, the wounded prisoner, Raed As’ad al-Salhi, 21, who died from his injuries today in a Zionist hospital after he was kidnapped by the Israeli occupation in August, when he was shot at a point-blank range.
The Front offers its sincere condolences to the family, comrades and friends of the martyred comrade in Dheisheh refugee camp, torch of the Intifada and steadfast base of resistance. He has joined the long convoy of the martyrs of the Palestinian people at the hands of the occupation. He was always present to confront the occupation in the city of Bethlehem, where the occupation forces and their barracks have been met with numerous heroic clashes, confrontations and struggles by the Palestinian people.
Palestine, Dheisheh camp and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine have lost a courageous struggler committed to liberation of the Palestinian people from the Zionist occupation. This young struggler was committed in his very veins to loyalty to the Palestinian cause and to his people.
The Popular Front is committed to remain on the same path for which this martyr’s life was taken, the path of return, resistance and liberation. It is confident that its comrades in Dheisheh camp, who have always advanced the struggle and paid the deep prices of sacrifice, will continue to lift high the banner of resistance to the Zionist occupation, despite the continuous targeting of the comrades and the camp.
Glory to the martyrs; victory is inevitable!
