Commenting on the criminal assault on Egyptian soldiers in Sinai this evening, Sunday August 5, 2012, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and its armed wing, the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades, expressed their strongest condemnation of this heinous crime, which killed at least 13 and wounded a number of Egyptian soldiers. The Front emphasized that Egyptian Arab blood is precious and that the Palestinian people will never forget the thousands of Egyptian martyrs who gave their lives for the Arab cause and Palestinian liberation, whose blood mixed with the martyrs of the Palestinian people.
The Front emphasized that this action is unacceptable to all Palestinians and all Palestinian forces, urging all parties to be accurate in reporting the details of this criminal operation, as the Palestinian people and their struggle will never be involved in such an act. The Front also warned that the only beneficiary of such an action is the state of Israel and its plans for hegemony and control over Sinai, all of Palestine, and the Arab world, and that the Zionist state has as a strong goal undermining any and all relations – particularly improved relations – between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Palestinian people, and fraying the deep ties between the Egyptian and the Palestinian people.
The Front expressed its condolences to the families of the martyrs, the Egyptian people and leadership, and the entire Arab nation for the loss of these martyrs of the Egyptian people.
