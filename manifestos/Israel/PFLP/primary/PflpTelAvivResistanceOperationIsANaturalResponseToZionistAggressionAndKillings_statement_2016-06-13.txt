The Palestinian resistance operation in “Tel Aviv” is an act of resistance and intifada and a natural reaction to the ongoing executions carried out against Palestinian youth and the Palestinian people by the Zionist state and its occupying forces, said the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
The carrying out of this action in the heart of the Zionist entity, near the Zionist Defense Ministry sends a defiant message to Avigdor Lieberman, the fascist extremist, and reaffirms that the path of resistance is the most effective means to extract the rights of our people and reject initiatives that seek to undermine our rights.
