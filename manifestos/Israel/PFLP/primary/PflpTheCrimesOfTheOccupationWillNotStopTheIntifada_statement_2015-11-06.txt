The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine confirmed that the escalating crimes of the occupation against the Palestinian people, especially the recent actions taken by the Zionist state and its army against our Palestinian people in the West Bank and Jerusalem, will not break the will of our people or stop the valiant uprising, nor will they put an end to the heroic resistance actions of Palestinian youth.
The Zionist escalation has entered a new phase within the framework of an ongoing war against the Palestinian people, including the Zionist law imposing a minimum prison sentence of three years on stone throwers or the throwing of Molotov cocktails or any other actions against the settlers and soldiers, as well as the imposition of large fines. This also includes the delivery of notifications of home demolitions to Palestinians because they are close to settlements in the West Bank, and the serious crime of the escalation against Palestinian children, including targeting school children with tear gas; the Front also notes the targeting of health workers and hospitals, media and press crews, and the threat of gassing and killing the Palestinian refugees in Aida refugee camp by occupation forces, documented on video.
The Front said that the occupationâ€™s claims that its escalating crimes have led to the reduction of the rate of operations against it in Jerusalem and the West Bank are false and illusionary meant to deceive their audience. The Palestinian youth have not been stopped by the the occupier and all of its crimes and actions have proven unsuccessful in defeating the Palestinian resistance, only increasing the determination of our people to confront the occupier and continue the Intifada.
