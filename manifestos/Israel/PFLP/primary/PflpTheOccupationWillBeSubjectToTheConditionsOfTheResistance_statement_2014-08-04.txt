The Palestinian delegation in Cairo to confirm the terms of the resistance reflects the unity of the factions in the battlefield and the political arena, said Comrade Hany Thawabteh in televised interviews on Sunday afternoon from Shifa Hospital.
He noted the Front’s confidence in the delegation, saying it is “locked in a battle of a different kind, in the same struggle as the military combat,” and that the Palestinian people stand together to emphasize the demands, conditions and rights of our people.
“The political battle is as crucial as the military battle and requires us to stand firmer, more serious and most committed to the terms of the resistance…in order to achieve these minimum requirements…and we will commit whatever the sacrifices,” said Thawabteh.
In an interview with Palestine Today, he said that the occupation state’s refusal to send a delegation to Cairo and instead to impose unilateral resolutions is an attempt by the Zionist enemy to cover up its massive crimes through political deception. “In the end, the occupation will be subject to the conditions of the resistance,” said Thawabteh.
