The murder of the boy martyr Mohammed al-Kasbah in a Zionist execution at dawn on July 3 will not pass silently, said the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Al-Kasbah, 17, was killed in cold blood by Zionist occupation forces as he sought to enter occupied Jerusalem. The murder of al-Kasbah will only increase our determinate to continue the struggle for freedom from occupation, said the Front.
The intensified Zionist campaign against our people, which has included ferocious targeting and arrests against our people in Jerusalem and the West Bank, the closing of the houses of martyrs and the expulsion of their families, and most recently, the killing of the boy al-Kasbah in a cold blooded murder will not be able to stop the march of the people to achieve their national goals of liberation and return.
The Front praised the return of heroic resistance actions coming to the forefront in the occupied West Bank to confront the occupation, in addition to the legendary steadfastness of our people in Jerusalem who confront the arrogant and racist policies of the occupier.
The Front emphasized the need to continue the resistance in all its forms against the occupation, to surround and confront the occupier on all levels, and to promote economic, political, academic and cultural boycott. It demanded that the Palestinian leadership implement the Palestinian Central Council resolutions to end security coordination and the political arrests in the West Bank, which have escalated in recent days; these arrests serve only the occupation and its agenda.
The Front also called for a national recognition of the current political moment and the sensitivity of the Palestinian struggle amid the continued division and the crimes of the occupation, to take action that is consistent with the requirements of the era, to escalate the confrontation with the occupation and strengthen the steadfastness of our people and also to confront all of the suspicious projects and plots, including the French initiative and the attempts of the occupation to confiscate our rights through “economic peace,” the isolation of villages and cities, or projects aiming to disarm the resistance and undermine the freedoms of our people in the Gaza Strip in exchange for lifting the siege.
