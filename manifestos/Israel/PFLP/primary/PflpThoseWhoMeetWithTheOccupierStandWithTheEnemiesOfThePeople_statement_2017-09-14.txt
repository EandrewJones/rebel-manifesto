The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine strongly condemned Palestinian Authority officials and merchants in Jenin for participating in a farewell ceremony for the Zionist liaison officer in the criminal occupation army, Samir Kioff.
The Front considers that the participation of a Palestinian delegation in the farewell of a Zionist war criminal who stained his hands with the blood of our people is a disgrace on those officials and a poisoned stab in the back of our people, disregarding the blood of the martyrs and the sacrifices of our people who are still struggling under the weight of the crimes of the occupation, in order to be exploited by the occupation to beautify this image.
The Front emphasized that this gathering in the so-called Salem settlement camp which has been a consistent source of suffering for our people, is yet another proof that the Palestinian Authority does not learn any lessons from its continuing great sins against the resistance of our Palestinian people, as shown in the rush of its leaders toward normalization and meetings with the enemy, and in light of the continuation of security coordination with the enemy by the security apparatus.
The Front pointed out that those who continue in the field of normalization are putting themselves in the path of confrontation of our people and should expect punishment for their actions, as national crimes have no statute of limitations.
The Front further emphasized that the Palestinian national responsibility requires all national, community, cultural and commercial actors to condemn these normalization meetings and to expose, besiege and boycott them.
