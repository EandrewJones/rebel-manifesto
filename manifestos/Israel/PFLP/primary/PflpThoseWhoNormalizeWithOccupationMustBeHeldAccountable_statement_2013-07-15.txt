The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine issued a statement supporting the popular movement for the rejection of and accountability for the Palestinian officials who have become symbols of normalization. The Front warned that the ongoing normalization meetings, including the latest which took place at PLO headquarters in Ramallah under the banner of the notorious so-called “Geneva Initiative,” seek to provide cover for US Secretary of State John Kerry’s latest attempt to mire the Palestinian national movement in the swamp of negotiations and free concessions to the occupier at the expense of Palestinian national constants, the unity of our people, and national steadfastness.
The Front also announced its support for the popular movement and general strike against the Zionist Prawer Plan that aims to displace our Palestinian people in the Negev, occupy our land, in yet another expression of the crimes of the Zionist project, which is fundamentally based on the theft of the land and the uprooting of the Palestinian people and the liquidation of our inalienable national rights.
