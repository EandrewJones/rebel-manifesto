The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine announced that it was boycotting the central festival being organized in Ramallah on May 17 in commemoration of the Nakba, because the program is being organized as a festive occasion without a program of struggle against the catastrophe committed against the Palestinian people.
Instead, the Front said, the Nakba must be commemorated in an atmosphere of struggle consistent with the occasion, and urged people to participate in the commemoration in Jalazoun refugee camp on Sunday with the participation of the Khaled Bakir center, the Nabd youth forum, and other organizations, insisting on the right of return of the Palestinian people.
