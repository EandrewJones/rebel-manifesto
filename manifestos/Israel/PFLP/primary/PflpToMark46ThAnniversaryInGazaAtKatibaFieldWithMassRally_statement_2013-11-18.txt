The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine will hold the rally in Gaza to mark the 46th anniversary of its founding in the Katiba field in Gaza City on December 7, 2013 at 12 pm.
The slogan of the anniversary rally will be “Hold fast to resistance, unity and the national constants.” The Front said that the anniversary rally will be a national event that upholds loyalty to the martyrs and prisoners, and to the national cause, especially the right of return and the liberation of Palestine, and the establishment of a revolutionary democratic national leadership to restore unity.
The Front said that the anniversary is a time to celebrate struggle, review our experience, and as a station on the road to assess the national experience, for which thousands of martyrs have given their lives, and to emphasize resistance as a strategic path and the commitment to the rights and interests of the popular classes, the refugees in the camps, and to raise the banner of the people, the workers, and the poor.
The Front called on all of our people to participate in this national celebration to emphasize the Palestinian national constants under which all forces have fought together in the trenches and fields of heroism.
The rally in Gaza will be part of a series of events and activities in all areas of the homeland and exile marking the anniversary.
