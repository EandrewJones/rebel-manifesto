The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounced the remarks of Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal in Paris before a meeting of the Iranian opposition. These positions fully coincide with the positions of the Zionist entity, which is working in cooperation with some Arab regimes to divert the character of the contradictions in the region, into a sectarian struggle between Sunnis and Shi’a, rather than the reality of the contradiction between the Arab people and the Zionist entity which targets the people and their interests.
The Front considered that this intersection of perspectives is the key explanation for the statement of al-Faisal that Iranian support for resistance forces creates chaos in the region. This statement distorts the reality of the resistance forces, of the Iranian position and support for them, and demonstrates the adoption of the Israeli narrative on the basis of which are launched continuous wars and aggression against the Palestinian people and the resistance forces in the region.
The PFLP further emphasized that as it strongly condemns al-Faisal’s statements, it is also deeply appalled by the continued promotion of such positions without accountability, demonstrating accelerated destructiveness of the official Saudi policy, which interferes in the internal affairs of many Arab countries, is involved in direct and proxy wars on Arab peoples and openly calls for the overthrow of regimes. This policy is woven into declared and undeclared relationships and alliances with the Zionist state, in the context of a growing interdependency of policies and plans hostile to the Arab people and their interests.
