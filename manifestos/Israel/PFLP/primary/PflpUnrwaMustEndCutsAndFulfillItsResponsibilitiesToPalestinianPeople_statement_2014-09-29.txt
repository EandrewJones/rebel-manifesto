The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is deeply concerned about growing reports of evasion and erosion of the responsibilities of the United Nations Relief Works Agency for Palestinian refugees in Gaza, particularly the duties toward the refugees displaced from their homes in the Zionist aggression.
The Front has been involved with many sectors of our people since 2007 in campaigns against programs to reduce services or cut costs at UNRWA, and with the start of the new academic year, it is once again concerned about the implementation of such austerity policies, particularly in the Gaza Strip, which is still suffering immensely from the impact of the brutal Zionist aggression. In response to the continuation of these policies and restrictions, our people organized protests in the camps in the Strip to condemn this policy and calling for UNRWA to fulfill its obligations to the children, the students, of Gaza.
We in the PFLP stand with our people, demanding that UNRWA take urgent action to fulfill its duties set by the decision of the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1949, and we emphasize the following:
First, the immediate restoration and reconstruction of the schools targeted in the aggression as the first priority of UNRWA
Second, the provision of school supplies and uniforms for students of UNRWA Schools in the devastated areas, and relief for the poor families who bore the heaviest costs of the aggression
Third, beginning housing programs for those residents in shelters in schools, in order to open the schools for education
Fourth, we urge Palestinian parents to continue their protest movement to achieve the rights of their children
Fifth, we call on national and Islamic factions to carry out their duties and to address those actions and decisions by UNRWA and other agencies that are unjust to our people and our children
Long live the struggle of the Palestinian people!
