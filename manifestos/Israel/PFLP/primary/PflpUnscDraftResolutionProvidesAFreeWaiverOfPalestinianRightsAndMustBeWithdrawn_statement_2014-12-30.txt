The draft resolution submitted to the United Nations Security Council is a free waiver of Palestinian rights, especially in reference to Jerusalem, the colonies, the right of return, the resistance and Palestinian national constants, said Comrade Zaher al-Shishtari, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.

Shishtari emphasized that this project reflects the exclusivity and dominance of the monopolistic leadership in pursuing this project, which is rejected by the Palestinian people and the Palestinian factions. “The Popular Front does not oppose raising the Palestinian cause in the United Nations and the Security Council, provided that the resolution submitted supports the Palestinian people’s rights in full and does not undermine or compromise those rights, and is based on a consensus which involves everyone in its drafting…and which goes alongside the move to enter all international institutions, particularly the International Criminal Court to prosecute the occupation for its crimes against our people and our land. None of this is the case in the submitted draft resolution.”

The PA leadership has done nothing to respond in a fitting way to the continuing crimes of the occupation, Shishtari said, including the killing of Ziad Abu Ein “such as ending security coordination, abolishing the Paris economic protocol, and the cancellation and rejection of the infamous Oslo agreement. On the contrary, the monopolistic leadership is still sticking to the futile path of negotiations, betting on the United States, the chief ally of the occupier. It has violated the rejection of the people and the factions to these negotiations. Now is the time for resistance in all forms. The masses of the Palestinian people reject this approach of settlement and concession and suspicious projects,” said Shishtari.
