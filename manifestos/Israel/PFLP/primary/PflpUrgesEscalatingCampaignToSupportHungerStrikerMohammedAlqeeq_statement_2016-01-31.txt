The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine urged an escalation in the support campaign for hunger-striking imprisoned Palestinian journalist Mohammed al-Qeeq, on hunger strike for over 65 days, noting that his health had deteriorated dangerously while the occupation refuses to release him.
The PFLP urged all Palestinian bodies, official and popular, to act on this issue, and for human rights organizations and institutions to raise his case in all international forums and expose the occupation’s policies against the prisoners, particularly highlighting the transfer of prisoners, isolation, administrative detention, ill prisoners and child prisoners as issues that should be raised before international courts.
The Front also commended the PFLP comrades in prison who launched a strike in support of Al-Qeeq and isolated comrade Bilal Kayed, urging all to keep the issue of prisoners in the forefront of the struggle, who stand on the front line of confrontation with the occupation.
Comrade Jamil Mizher, leader of the PFLP’s branch in Gaza and member of the Political Bureau, said that a victory for Al-Qeeq is necessary, calling for all action to protect his life and demand his release. He further noted that the occupation threat to the life of Al-Qeeq will only increase the determination of the Palestinian people to confront the crimes of the occupation and pursue the path of resistance.
Furthermore, Mizher noted that it is no surprise that the so-called Supreme Court of the Zionist entity refused to order Al-Qeeq’s release, saying that this is exactly what is to be expected from this illegitimate court that is a full part of the occupation against our people, which legitimizes the torture, abuse and imprisonment of Palestinians.
