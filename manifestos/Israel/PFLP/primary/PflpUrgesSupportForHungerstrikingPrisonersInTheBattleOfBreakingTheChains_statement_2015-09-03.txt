The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine urged broader support and organizing to support the Palestinian administrative detainees engaged in an open hunger strike in the Naqab desert prison for fourteen consecutive days in rejection of the policy of administrative detention, who have now been transferred to solitary confinement in Asqelan, the Naqab and Ella.
The striking prisoners, the leader Nidal Abu Aker, Shadi Maâ€™ali, Ghassan Zawahra, Munir Abu Sharar and Badr al-Ruzza, have launched this open hunger strike after their decision to boycott the military tribunals, emphasizing their determination to continue their strike in Israeli jails until the prison administration responds to their demand to end the policy of administrative detention.
The Front demanded that international human rights organizations exercise their duties to expose the crimes of the occupation against the prisoners, including the policy of administrative detention, which constitute a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and international conventions.
The Front emphasized the importance of public support and activity for the administrative detainees on hunger strike, in a tough battle they are waging which could last for some time. Escalating the efforts to support the prisoners is a major factor of pressure on the occupation as well as supporting the morale of the prisoners to continue their strike until liberation.
The Front expressed its confidence that the administrative detainees would achieve victory in this battle, like the victorious former prisoners Khader Adnan, Mohammed Allan and other heroic prisoners.
The Front said that it will organize a continuous series of events in the homeland and diaspora to support the strike and their victory in the battle.
