On behalf of the General Secretary, Ahmad Sa’adat, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine expresses its sincere congratulations to the people of Bolivia, the popular movements of Bolivia, and the progressive forces of the world on the occasion of the victory of internationalist Bolivian President Evo Morales for a third term. This victory is a victory for the values of freedom and social justice, confrontation of imperialism and its policies on a global level, and for the Palestinian people and their struggle for liberation.
The victory of President Morales, who is of the indigenous people of Bolivia, is a clear demonstration of the Bolivian people’s support for his policies in the direction of the country, the escalation of the struggle for socialism, building support for the popular classes and Bolivian masses, and confronting the capitalists and wealthy forces who were defeated in this election.
These election results provide further support to the Palestinian people in their just struggle against the Zionist occupation, noting in particular the clear and bold positions taken by Bolivia upholding the rights of our people, including the statements of President Evo Morales during the recent aggression on the Gaza Strip, including his statement that the occupier is a terrorist state.
