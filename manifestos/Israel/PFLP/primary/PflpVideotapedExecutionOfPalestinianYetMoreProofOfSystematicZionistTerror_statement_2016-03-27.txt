The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine stated that the publication of a video showing an Israeli soldier executing a young Palestinian in Tel Rumeida, al-Khalil, is yet another evidence of the nature of the fascist and criminal Zionist entity and its systematic terror against the Palestinian people.
The criminal methods of the occupation are diverse and growing, including the siege of cities and villages in the West Bank and of Jerusalem, the imposition of more walls and barriers, acceleration of home demolitions, including the demolition of 18 homes in Khirbet Tana east of Nablus; ongoing mass arrests, attacks and violence against the people, ongoing threats against Al-Aqsa, all in a desperate attempt to stamp out the flame of intifada nurtured by Palestinian youth. This is a new reality that the occupier is incapable of breaking and destroying.
This crime and all of the ongoing crimes of the occupation are a stain on the conscience of the international community which remains silent and inactive with a policy of double standards, that mourns for some victims of terror in the world while ignoring victims or legitimating the terror against them elsewhere, particularly against our people in Palestine for the past 68 years of occupation terror, crimes and massacres.
The Front renewed its call for investing all of the energies of the Palestinian people to serve the goals of the intifada and confronting all attempts that seek to undermine it.
