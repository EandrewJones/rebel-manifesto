The criminal Benjamin Netanyahu is now using the arena of the United Nations to continue his deception, lies, threats, intimidation and misdirection, attempting to cover up his and his army’s terror massacres against Palestinian civilians, children and elders, who are still being killed in cold blood in full view of the world, said the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in response to Netanyahu’s speech at the UN General Assembly.
The Front noted that Netanyahu tried and failed to assume the role of the victim, marketing the Zionist narrative and attempting to discredit the Palestinian resistance factions by putting it in one basket with terror organizations created and supported by the U.S. and Western powers.
Netanyahu has no place speaking before the General Assembly of the United Nations, said the Front – instead, the only place he should be speaking is before the International Criminal Court in the Hague and charged with war crimes, genocide, incitement to genocide and responsibility for the horrific massacres against the Palestinian people.
Once again, the Front emphasized the importance of prosecuting the Zionist war criminals in international courts for their crimes against the Palestinian people, which requires Palestinian officials to urgently sign the Rome Statute and join the International Criminal Court, and immediately file to prosecute the leaders of the occupier as war criminals.
The Front also reiterated that the solution for Palestine does not lie in the adoption of the so-called “Arab peace initiative” or the notorious negotiations, but in the use of all means of resistance – political, diplomatic, popular and armed – to secure our legitimate rights.
Unity of the Palestinian position behind our national constants, the resistance and the rights of our people is the path forward to end the division and restore unity, and must include ending negotiations and security coordination with the occupier, said the Front.
