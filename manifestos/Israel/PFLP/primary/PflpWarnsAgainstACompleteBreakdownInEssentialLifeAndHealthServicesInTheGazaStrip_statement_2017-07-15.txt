The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine warned of a complete breakdown of the conditions of life, existence and health in the Gaza Strip as a result of the collective punishment policies adopted by the Palestinian Authority and its government, which has led in recent days to the collapse of infrastructure in the Strip, especially the electricity and health sectors, calling upon them to end this policy immediately.
The Front said that these measures reflect a policy of collective punishment that require the Executive Committee of the PLO to lift the cover from and expose those responsible and the forces directing them from behind for holding the lives of over two million Palestinians hostage.
The price paid by the Palestinian people at the moment in the Strip is much more valuable than any partisan gains or narrow factional achievements by a party attempting to achieve this or that by manipulating the lives of innocent civilians.
The Front also blamed the United Nations and international institutions responsible for the lives of the Palestinian people for their silence and inaction on the Gaza Strip while vital services like electricity, water and health are disrupted and threatening a disaster for the lives of thousands.
The PFLP emphasized that the occupation is responsible for all of these crimes, warning of the consequences of the continuing siege imposed on the Gaza Strip for over 10 years. The popular explosion will rebound against the occupation and against all those who contribute to the escalation of the suffering of our people.
