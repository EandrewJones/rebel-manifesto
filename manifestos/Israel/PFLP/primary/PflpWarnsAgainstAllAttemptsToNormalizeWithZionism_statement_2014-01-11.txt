The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine warned against all attempts to open channels of normalization with the Zionist entity under various suspicious names and defeatist objectives, calling for accountability for the personalities responsible for sponsoring and participating in the normalization conferences held at the City Inn Ramallah and in Jerusalem on January 9 and 10.
These conferences were disrupted by strong protests from Palestinian youth who made clear their firm rejection of normalization. The Front saluted the young Palestinians who confronted these normalization events inside and outside the hotels where they took place; those Palesitnian youth expressed the true position of the Palestinian people which reject all forms of normalization and encounters with suspicious Zionist projects under any pretext whatsoever.
In a press release, the Front said, “Zionist assaults are continuing against cities, villages and refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza and the siege continues on Gaza, with starvation, bombardment and the killing of children. The participation of defeated Palestinian elements in the normalization conference in Ramallah under empty and defeatist slogans about so-called ‘peace’ and ‘ending the conflict between two peoples,’ aims first to market and to provide cover for the Zionist racist policies practiced against our people since the Nakba of ’48, which resulted in the imposition of control by force of arms on the entire Palestinian soil.”
Furthermore, the Front rejected such meetings and activities that threaten serious damage to the Palestinian national liberation struggle and work to legitimize the occupation, settlement, and the liquidation of the right of return.
