The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine warned the monopolistic Palestinian leadership in the Palestine Liberation Organization against any attempts to obscure or hide information regarding meetings with Zionist representatives in London in late 2016.
The Front called upon this leadership to respond to media reports issued on 31 March regarding so-called “track two diplomacy” meetings in London with Zionist “current and former” officials and academics in late 2016, revealed by British Zionist lobby organization BICOM and reports in the British media. These meetings were designed in order to develop new pathways for negotiations and the so-called “peace process” in Palestine.
The Front stated that such actions and reports undermine the growing international boycott movement and constitute a stab in the back to thousands of Palestinian, Arab and international campaigners in the movement that calls on all to isolate the occupying power and bring it before international courts for its war crimes against the Palestinian people.
The PFLP said that these frequent reports of public and private meetings indicate continued reliance on the path of failure and liquidation, the so-called negotiations under US auspices, noting that covering up such meetings under the guise of “academics and politicians meeting” is an attempt to hide these meetings behind the back of the Palestinian people. The return of the monopolistic PLO leadership to this path of negotiations is rejected strongly by the Palestinian people.
The Front called upon Palestinian national forces and the Palestinian people everywhere to confront these policies that have proven their failure over the past decades, which threaten to liquidate our national rights and distort the cause of our people. The PFLP demanded that the PLO leadership admit the failure of this path and immediately end all such activities which threaten to drag the Palestinian people into disaster.
