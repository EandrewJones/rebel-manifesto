The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine warned against dealing with the US Secretary of State John Kerry in his visit to the region, which is aimed to pressure Palestinians to stop the intifada and return to the spiral of senseless and harmful negotiations, and to provide security for the occupation which is attempting to emerge from the situation imposed upon it by the rising intifada.
The Front noted that United States imperialism is a full partner with the Zionist occupation in the ongoing crimes against the Palestinian people. Therefore, such visits only bring more disaster, devastation and Zionist crimes for the Palestinian people.
Furthermore, the Front noted that the remarks of Nikolay Mladenov, the United Nations coordinator for the peace process in the Middle East and representative of the Secretary-General regarding the current situation were entirely biased in favor of the occupation. The role of the United Nations is to press for the implementation of resolutions of international legitimacy and protect our occupied people from the crimes of colonialism, not to propose “solutions” to serve the interests of the occupation and strengthen its control over Palestinian land.
The Front noted that Mladenov’s proposed political and procedural steps to change the situation in Palestine predominantly represent the Zionist position, attempt to justify the crimes of the occupation against our people and return us to the fruitless path of endless negotiations.
The Front also emphasized that the primary problem for the Palestinian people is the occupation, which is the perpetrator and the source of hatred and terror, and that the Palestinian people are working to resist terror and colonialism and recover their stolen rights, as is legitimate under international law.
Mladenov’s call upon the Palestinian Authority to continue and improve security coordination is a call to attack the resistance and undermine the intifada on behalf of the occupation. The Front emphasized that the responsibility of the United Nations is to listen to the voice of the Palestinian people and to respond to its just cause, which is recognized by the United Nations’ own resolutions and institutions.
