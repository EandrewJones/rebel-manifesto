The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine warned against any attempt to impose a “French initiative” as a replacement for the implementation of the rights of the Palestinian people. While welcoming all international efforts to end the Israeli occupation, the Front noted that the French initiative is framed as an attempt to save the “two-state solution” and not to implement international resolutions and law, including the right of return of Palestinian refugees and full Palestinian self-determination and sovereignty.
Furthermore, the Front said that the timing of the re-launched French initiative, which appears as a reaction to the continued intensifying Zionist settlement policy which blocks the “two-state solution,” also comes in the context of international efforts to exploit ongoing conflicts in Arab countries to impose a “solution” on the Palestinian people that falls far short of the implementation of their rights.
The Front also demanded that the Executive Committee of the PLO adhere to the full implementation of the rights of the Palestinian people, and to reject any initiative that inhibits these rights.
