Comrade Hani Thawabteh, member of the Central Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said that the so-called ceasefire proposal is a new attempt to chain the Palestinian resistance, and that the response of the resistance to this initiative will come through targeting Zionist settlements and sites.
The Arab regimes and “international community” are co-conspirators in the Zionist aggression on Gaza, said Thawabteh. Thawabteh noted that the so-called ceasefire initiative excludes the needs of the Palestinian people, and guarantees no “calm” from the ongoing attacks by settlers in the West Bank and Jerusalem and the ongoing Zionist attacks of all forms against our people everywhere.
In an interview with Al-Quds TV, Thawabteh said that the Palestinian resistance was able to record real advances in their response to the Zionist assault on Gaza, forming a dilemma for the Zionist enemy which seeks to grasp at an initiative for “calm.” The occupation state launched a war against civilians in full view of the people of the world, said Thawabteh, and meanwhile the resistance proved its readiness through tactics presented by the resistance in the field, and despite its modest resources, it has shaken the strongest military arsenal in the Middle East.
Responding to the threats of occupation Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue and escalate their assault in the event of non-compliance with the so-called ceasefire, Thawabteh said that “the Palestinian people have the will and determination to continue their struggle until the last drop of blood. Zionist threats have been continuous since the first Zionist assault on Gaza.” He warned that any ground invasion and war will become a cemetery for the soldiers of the occupation, and that the enemy understands that such a ground invasion will be very costly.
