The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine expressed its solidarity with the struggle of the Moroccan people and in particular with that of the impoverished classes and social sectors struggling for their just and legitimate rights, especially under conditions of deprivation, isolation and the policy of marginalization of rural areas.
The Front noted that the system of social and class oppression in the country drives thousands of young Moroccans to migrate abroad, especially with the increase in poverty and unemployment rates, growing illiteracy rates, rampant capitalism and privatization and the confiscation of basic human rights.
The PFLP further emphasized that the reactionary Moroccan regime, which engages in normalization with the Zionist entity and works to forward its policies according to the U.S. agenda domestically cannot support the Palestinian people and the cause of Jerusalem and liberation on this reactionary path.
Further, the Front stressed that the just struggle of the Arab people to achieve their goals of social justice, equality, fair distribution of wealth, fighting corruption and abuse of power and influence is one of the most important conditions to restore the cause of our Arab nation, foremost of which is the cause of Palestine at the center of the Arab struggle.
The Front also urged the release of all political prisoners in Moroccan prisons and an end to the use of torture in prisons.
