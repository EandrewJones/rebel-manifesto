The Palestine Today newspaper conducted an interview with comrade Abu Ahmad Fuad, member of the political bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), where he stated that “the main point of disagreement between the Palestinian factions is the condition to be committed to peace deals, such as the Oslo agreement, signed between the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel.”
Comrade Abu Ahmad Fuad also stated that the Front does not accept these agreements, and will not agree to be committed to them. He also said that the PFLP rejects the conditions of the Quartet. The interview was conducted on March 25, 2009.
Abu Ahmad said that the main obstacles in the internal talks are issues regarding the government, its agenda, its formula and the agreements signed by the PLO.
“If the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank keeps its stance regarding recognizing previously signed peace agreements, then there will be no unity government”, Abu Ahmad said, “Any attempt to force the factions to be committed to the Oslo deals and the Road Map Plan, the Paris Economic deal or the security deals signed with Israel, will not lead us to a unity deal”.
He said that peace talks with Israel were not conducted in order to achieve the Palestinian rights as they only served the Israeli interests, and added that these agreements only brought more losses to the Palestinians and more concessions.
Comrade Abu Ahmad Fuad also said that “even if Hamas and Fateh sign a deal based on recognizing previously signed peace agreements, the PFLP will not deal with this government and will not recognize it”.
He added that “Israel never officially recognized the internationally guaranteed right of return, and refused to fully withdraw from all of the occupied territories, included Jerusalem.”
