The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine welcomed the release of 26 of the Palestinian prisoners held since before the implementation of the Oslo agreements, and sent its congratulations to the heroic freed prisoners, their families, and all people of freedom. At the same time, the Front warned against subjecting the file of the prisoners to the futile ‘negotiations’, saying that for twenty years, the prisoners and the nation have paid a great price. The experience of Oslo and the repeated broken promises of prisoner release was a bitter experience that threatened the rights of all prisoners as a whole and kept them subject to the blackmail of the occupation and its security forces, and turned the unprecedented arrests and decades-long detention of prisoners into a normal topic of the ongoing negotiations. This runs contrary to all experiences of national liberation movements and the revolutionary struggle against colonialism and occupation.
The Front called on all the forces of our people to reject these negotiations, which resumed August 14 in occupied Jerusalem, and demanded that the Palestinian Authority leadership retreat from its dangerous decision, which serves the occupation and its strategic objectives alongside its US ally. Further, it called for an immediate end to these negotiations in accordance with the Palestinian national consensus and the decisions of PLO institutions.
The Front said that it will remain, whatever the cost, with our people, in a continuous path of struggle in a grassroots campaign to bring down the Oslo accords and their devastating consequences for the Palestinian cause.
