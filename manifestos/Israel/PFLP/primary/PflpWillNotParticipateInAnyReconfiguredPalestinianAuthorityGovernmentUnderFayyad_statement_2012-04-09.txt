The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine stated on April 9, 2012 that it will not participate in any way in a new or rearranged Palestinian Authority government under Salam Fayyad. The Front said that any such configuration laks legitimacy, has not been given confidence by the Legislative Council nor does it enjoy a national consensus of national and Islamic forces.
The Front said that any such attempt would only be an obstacle in the path of meaningful national unity and reconciliation and only exacerbate the national crisis. The Front once again reiterated that the Palestinian Authority must cease all forms of security coordination with the occupation. It said that the governments of the status quo – whether in Gaza or Ramallah – are not sufficient to confront the dangers to the Palestinian people, their land and cause, and urged national unity to confront the occupation and its plans to confiscate Palestinian land and liquidate Palestinian rights.
