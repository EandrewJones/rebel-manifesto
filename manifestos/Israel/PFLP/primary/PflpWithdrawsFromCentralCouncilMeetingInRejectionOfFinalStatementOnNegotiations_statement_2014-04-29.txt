The representatives of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine withdrew from the closing session of the PLO Central Council in rejection of the final statement of the Council on the return to the negotiations, as the statement supports the persistence of the negotiations approach and preparing for their resumption, clearly part of the negotiating track under the auspices of the United States. Based on our call to end the negotiations and the policy of security coordination of the Palestinian Authority, the PFLP announced its withdrawal from the final session of the Central Council so as to not constitute a political cover for the approach of negotiations.
The Front had earlier demanded that the final statement make clear not only its rejection of the liquidationist Kerry plan but also call for a final end to the negotiations project as a whole and to security coordination.
