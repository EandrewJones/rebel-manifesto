The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said that the frenzy for cold-blooded murder sweeping the occupation soldiers will not bring any security or safety to the occupation state but will only inspire greater resistance, and will not break the resolve of Palestinian youth to confront the occupation.
The occupying soldiers opened fire on Palestinian youth on January 12 in Al-Khalil and Bethlehem, killing three youth, the martyrs Mohammed Ahmad Kawazbeh, 23; Adnan Hamid Halaiqa, 17; and Srour Ahmad Abu Srour, 17, in an attack of Zionist terror against our people, which comes in the framework of an overall war against the Palestinian people by the occupation and an attempt to eliminate the intifada.
The occupation soldiers are utilizing a war machine and heavy weaponry against youth armed with will and determination, indicating the failure of the arrogance and systematic criminal policy of the occupation and its inability to stop the intifada.
The Front demanded international action to hold the occupier accountable for its ongoing war crimes and collective punishment against the Palestinian people.
