The Progressive Labor Union Front in Palestine mourned the martyr of life, Palestinian worker Adel Mohammad Yacoub, of Balaa in Tulkarem, who lost his life at the Taybeh checkpoint south of Tulkarem, when he attempted to pass through the checkpoint allocated for the entry of Palestinian workers into occupied Palestine â€™48 in order to work.
Yacoub passed as a result of overcrowding at the checkpoint, which sees 10,000 Palestinian workers crossing daily. The Front confirmed that the suffering of Palestinian workers at the occupation checkpoints and the martyrdom of Yacoub come within a systematic policy of the occupier that treats Palestinian workers as less than human, suppressed and their rights denied through national and class oppression.
Furthermore, the PLUF noted that the occupation takes advantage of the dire economic situation dire experienced by our people due to the policies and practices of the occupation. The PLUF called for the adoption of economic policies to alleviate poverty and unemployment and contribute to saving hundreds of thousands of workers and their families from the impacts of the desperate economic situations. The Front also called upon all Palestinian unions to expand their international work, in particular international trade union meetings and forums, to expose Israeli practices and push for concrete steps and action against the racist occupation and its policies, including expanding the international boycott and isolation of Israel.
