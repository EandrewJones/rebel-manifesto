The Progressive Labor Union Front renewed its rejection of the Social Security Act No. 6 of 2016 of the Palestinian Authority, saying that it fails to provide social protection or dignity for workers.
The Progressive Labor Union Front is part of a national campaign for social security and participated in a Palestinian national meeting about the Social Security Law on April 5 in Ramallah, with the wide participation of trade unions, civil society organizations and members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, unified in rejecting the law.
Mohammed Jawabra, a leader in the PLUF, said that the process of drafting the law failed to prioritize the interests and needs of workers, and that the law creates a social security system that ensures workers with disabilities and retirees will live in poverty. Private sector workers are disadvantaged by the law, which requires high individual contributions.
The PLUF criticized the involvement of Palestinian union officials in approving the draft law under pressure from employers, and called upon them to rescind their endorsements. The PLUF called for the rejection and repeal of the law and its revision into a law that supports workersâ€™ rights and social justice.
