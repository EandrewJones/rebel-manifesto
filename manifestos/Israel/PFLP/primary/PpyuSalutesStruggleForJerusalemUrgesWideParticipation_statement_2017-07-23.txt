The Palestinian Progressive Youth Union (PPYU) presents its strongest revolutionary greetings to the Palestinian masses in Jerusalem, facing the naked brutality of the occupation and its barbaric forces, which persist in their aggression and fascist measures against the land and the people, persisting in their crimes and reaching the level of direct harm to the holy sites in general and the Al-Aqsa Mosque in particular.
The Union considered that the true face of the Palestinian people today is reflected in the heroic revolutionary efforts in Jerusalem, refusing submission and retreat in the face of Zionist attacks. This proves that the uprising of Jerusalem continues the struggle of Palestinian revolutionary youth in every part of Palestine from the river to the sea who cast aside all illusions. The martyrs of Deir Abu Mashaal merge with the blood of the martyrs of the Jabareen family from Umm al-Fahm, and before them the martyr Bahaa Alyan, the son of Jerusalem, and the martyr Muhannad al-Halabi, the son of Ramallah.
The Union called upon the Palestinian people everywhere they are, in diaspora, in the Gaza Strip, in the occupied West Bank and occupied Palestine â€™48 to rise up and take to the squares in active struggle, widening the confrontation with the occupation on all points of contact in support of our Palestinian people in occupied Jerusaelm and against the attacks on Al-Aqsa Mosque. The escalation of the intifada is the true gate towards the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people and the confrontation of escalating Zionist crimes.
