The Progressive Labor Union Action Front called upon all labor unions on Palestinian, Arab and international levels to develop and promote the boycott campaign in all forms against the Zionist occupation state, “Israel,” and its brutal and genocidal crimes, its occupation imposed on the Palestinian people and denial of Palestinian rights, and its fascist practices of fascism, settlement, siege, killing children, women, men and elders, and the demolition of homes around their occupants, as were vividly manifested in its aggression on the Gaza Strip.
The Front called on all Arab and international labor unions to practice their international solidarity obligations and practice boycott, divestment and sanctions against the occupation state and all of its institutions, at the forefront, the Histadrut, the Zionist labor federation which is part and parcel of the occupation state, plays a major role in the continuation and support of the occupation, and seeks to improve its image before the world. The Histadrut is in direct conflict with values of international labor solidarity, anti-racism and justice for oppressed people.
The Progressive Labor Union Action Front also called upon the Palestinian officialdom to act immediately to join all relevant international conventions and organizations, in particular the International Criminal Court, and to sign the Rome Statute, and work to bring the Zionist occupation to trial in international courts for its crimes against the Palestinian people.
It also called for intensifying the movement to boycott the goods and products of the occupation within Palestine and to shatter the economic dependency and policies created by the Oslo accords and the Paris economic protocal, saying that Palestinian economic policies that support the steadfastness of the Palestinian people and confront the occupier are necessary to address unemployment and poverty.
