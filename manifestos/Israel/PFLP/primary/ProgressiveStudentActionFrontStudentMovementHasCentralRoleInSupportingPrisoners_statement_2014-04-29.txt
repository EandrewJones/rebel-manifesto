The Progressive Student Action Front said that the Palestinian student movement has a central role to play in supporting the prisoners’ struggle, the spearhead in exposing the policies and practices of the occupation. The issue of prisoners, said the Front, is a popular and national cause that requires a united stand at the grassroots and political level to intensify efforts and build cohesive programs to support the struggle of the prisoners and their rights.
The PSAF called for the pursuit of all available means for their release and return to their homes among their families and communities, and to organize among the Arab masses on the issue of Palestinian prisoners, especially since the international struggle for the Palestinian cause requires the Arab and Islamic nations and the whole world to stand in support of the rights of the Palestinian people to achieve self-determination, liberation, and the freedom of our prisoenrs from the clutches of oppression.
The Front saluted the prisoners’ steadfastness and confrontation of the Zionist occupation from behind bars, and hailed the resilience of the prisoners’ families in demanding their imprisoned family members’ rights. The Front said further that commitment to the national resistance program is a means of salvation for the prisoners and that their liberation will come through the guns of the resistance.
This came during the Front’s participation in a week of prisoner solidarity at the Islamic University of Gaza.
