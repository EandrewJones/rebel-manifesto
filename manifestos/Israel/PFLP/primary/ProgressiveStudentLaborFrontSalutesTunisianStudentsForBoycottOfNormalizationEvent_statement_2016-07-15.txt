The Progressive Student Labor Front directed its sincere pride and warm greetings to their comrades and colleagues in the General Union of Tunisian Students (UGET) on their decision to withdraw from an international conference on higher education rather than participate in a joint panel with representatives of Zionist student organizations. They expressed a clear and explicit rejection of normalization with the Zionist entity and full support for the Palestinian cause.
The PSLF denounced the pressure by some parties (including, unfortunately, some Arab parties) to participate in “joint events,” considering such pressures to be suspicious attempts aimed at expanding the scope of normalization. The PSLF expressed its high confidence in the General Union of Tunisian Students that it will not be deceived by such schemes.
The General Union announced on July 11 that it was wighdrawing from an international symposium in Brussels, Belgium, on the development of higher education, “when we arrived and saw the seminar program, which included a list of participating delegations, we were surprised by the participation of a student delegation of the Zionist entity.”
The UGET boycotted the seminar, titled the “Third dialogue with Southern Mediterranean countries on higher education policies,” saying that normaliation is contrary to the principles and constants of the Union and the Tunisian people.
The General Union of Tunisian Students expressed its opposition to the continued participation of the Tunisian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, and the Tunisan student movement arm of the Ennahda party, in the seminar despite the normalization with the Zionist entity. It called on Arab and European organizations to boycott the seminar and normalization activities in support of the just cause of the Palestinian people.
