A statement issued by the Palestinian Youth Organization in Lebanon:
The Palestinian Youth Organization is demanding the immediate release of Turkish members of the World Anti-Imperialist Youth Union from Turkish government jails.
Çagdas Cengiz, chair of the Turkish Youth Union; Elif Ilhamoglu, secretary of the World Anti-Imperialist Youth Union; and Ugur Aytaç, deputy chair of the Turkish Youth Union, and 13 more comrades, were arrested by the Turkish government following their protest against the entry of the US warship USS Ross (DGG71) to Turkey.
The youth protested at the shores of Istanbul’s port, working to prevent US soldiers from entering Turkish beaches; the US soldiers were there for a NATO mission in the Black Sea. The USS Ross is a guided-missile destroyer warship. The youth protesters chanted “Down with American imperialism!” and “Yankee go home!”
It is critically important to unite all progressive and leftist forces and youth in their struggle against the assaults of US imperialism and Zionism, which aim to destroy our homeland and subjugate our people to the dominance of US imperialism and Zionism.
We in the Palestinian Youth Organization stand in solidarity with our international comrades who struggle against US imperialism and the Zionist enemy, with a unity of purpose to confront our common enemy. We call for the release of all detained comrades.
Long live Palestine! Long live international struggle against imperialism and Zionism!
Freedom for our prisoners in Israeli occupation jails and in the prisons of all states.
Victory is ours!
