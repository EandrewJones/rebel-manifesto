Comrade Abu Ahmad Fouad, Deputy General Secretary of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine sent a letter of condolences to the family of the child martyr Mohammed Abu Khdeir, brutally murdered and tortured at the hands of Zionist settlers.
“On behalf of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, its leaders, cadres, members and supporters in the homeland of Palestine and in exile and diaspora, we convey our deepest and sincere sympathy, solidarity and support. The hero and martyr Mohammed, who fell at the hands of criminal Zionist fascists, shines in the skies of Palestine as a star. The martyrs of Palestine will always fly in the sky above our homeland and live deeply in the pulse of the people and their hearts and minds,” wrote Comrade Abu Ahmad.
“The fascist terrorism of the occupation state and its rampant brutal criminality will not terrorize our people, will not deter us from demanding our legitimate rights to freedom, self-determination and return,” said the letter.
“The Zionist entity will come to an end like all invasions that have come through our region, they have all ended and gone, and this is what awaits the Zionist occupation at the end. Palestine has paid a dear, costly, and irreplaceable price in martyrs, prisoners, wounded and suffering. Victory is definitely coming sooner or later, and the Zionist entity will go to the dustbin of history.”
