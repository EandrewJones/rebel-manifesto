The Progressive Student Action Front issued the following statement on the current situation in Palestine, honouring the anniversary of the martyrdom of leaders Yamen Faraj and Amjad Mleitat:
To the great masses of our people:
Today is the anniversary of a heroic battle of resistance and pride, the martyrdom of the heroic leaders Yamen Faraj, secretary of the Progressive Student Action Front at An-Najah University, and his comrade Amjad Mleitat, leader of the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades, in Nablusâ€™ Mountain of Fire.
These days are times of pride and dignity, written in the words and actions of the masses of our people in occupied Jerusalem, our steadfast people in the lands occupied in 1948 and all the masses of our people in the occupied West Bank and our steadfast people in the besieged Gaza Strip and its proud resistance, of an uprising of anger toward the occupiers and criminal settlers, asserting that the Palestinian people do not and will not give in to the occupier and will not accept the crimes of its army and its hordes of settlers.
We in the Progressive Student Action Front, on the anniversary of the martyrdom of these heroes, declare the following:
The blood of the child martyr Mohammed Abu Khdeir will not be forgotten, it will remain an indelible stain of fire pursuing the occupier and its hordes of criminal settlers.
We urge the masses of our people to continue their mass movement and confront the Zionist occupier in points of contact in every corner of our occupied homeland.
All forms of security cooperation and coordination with the occupier must end immediately; our people will not forgive those who stabbed them in the back.
We confirm that all of our comrades everywhere in Palestine are fully ready to commit in the ranks of Popular Protection Committees in all villages and camps to defend our people in the face of attacks by the occupiers and criminal settlers.
We promise our people that we will be at the forefront of confrontations with the occupier and stand on the front lines and we assure all our comrades that honouring our commitment to these leaders means opening wide the doors of confrontation with the occupier.
The story of the martyrs is not one of defeat. Victory is narrated in the words of their blood. Forward to continue the popular movement against the occupier towards a third popular Intifada
Long live the struggle of our people
