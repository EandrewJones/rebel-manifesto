guarantee the rights and security of the Palestinians in their steadfastness and unity
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine stated on September 15, 2012 that the Sabra and Shatila massacres, and the massacres against the Palestinian people from Deir Yassin until today, confirm that no countries or authorities can be entrusted with the lives of the Palestinian people and their inalienable rights, and that the only guarantee is steadfastness and unity in the struggle for national rights and economic, social and cultural rights within the occupied homeland, in refugee camps and in all areas of exile and diaspora.
On the 30th anniversary, the Front said that the Sabra and Shatila massacre, in which thousands of Palestinians and Lebanese were massacred under the responsibility of the war criminal Ariel Sharon after the exit of the PLO from Lebanon in 1982 came as part of a continued policy of massacres against the Palestinian people, land and dignity inside and outside Palestine since its occupation in 1948 and the displacement of its people. It also confirms that to this day, Zionism, the Zionist state and its leaders have been fully supported by US imperialism in a policy of terror and genocide against the Palestinian people, with the silence, complicity and support of the international community, with complete impunity from justice.
The Front demanded that the Palestinian leadership must uphold its responsibilities to our people in the refugee camps to stand firm to win their national rights, in particular the right of return to the homes from which they were displaced, as recognized internationally, first and foremost in Resolution 194. The Front also demanded the exertion of all sincere national efforts to implement reconciliation and end the internal division which depletes the forces of our people and their struggle and which provides a favorable environment for the occupationâ€™s attempts to liquidate our national cause and return it to an era of dependency and external guardianship.
