Comrade Ahmad Sa’adat, the imprisoned General Secretary of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, sent a message to re-elected Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, congratulating him for his success in the presidential elections and historically significant victory.
Sa’adat expressed confidence that the defense of freedom, real dignity, and the values of social justice, indigenous rights, and the high level of development of a democratic social and political culture of the Venezuelan people is the key to the continued victory of President Chavez and the Bolivarian revolution in the march of national sovereignty, true independence, and social progress on the road to socialism in Venezuela.
Sa’adat emphasized that the Palestinian people everywhere have great pride and solidarity with President Chavez’ support for the Palestinian people in the face of occupation and continuing Zionist aggression, and his stand for the just and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. He saluted the Venezuelan people and their democratic and progessive forces, emphasizing the importance of strengthening the bonds of Palestinian-Venezuelan friendship and the joint struggle of our peoples.
PFLP spokesperson Khalil Maqdesi also expressed the congratulations of the Front to the Venezuelan people as they continue on their path of Bolivarian revolution, saying that the electoral victory in Venezuela was also a sharp blow to the efforts of US imperialism to reestablish hegemony in Latin America. Maqdesi saluted the revolutionary processes taking place throughout Latin America, noting that the continent is a centre of struggle, of political and social development, and of resistance to imperialism that stands in clear counterpoint to the role of the United States.
He noted in particular that the Venezuelan people have for the past 12 years been building a revolutionary legacy of popular engagement and true social change, mobilizing in massive numbers both to defend and to advance their revolution, and that the reclaimed legacy of Bolivar is one of national liberation, and one which also speaks to the ongoing Palestinian and Arab national liberation struggle.
