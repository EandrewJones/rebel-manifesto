The arrest of Palestinian leader and parliamentarian Khalida Jarrar is a clear part of the Zionist policy of systematic targeting of the leaders of Palestinian resistance, said Comrade Zaher al-Shishtari, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
One of the most important reasons for the arrest of Jarrar is her resistance to the order expelling her to Jericho seceral months ago and the resulting campaign of support and solidarity on a Palestinian, Arab and international level, Shishtari said.
In an interview on Al-Quds TV, he said that “it is clear that the occupation is expanding its aggression against our people, and the arrest of PLC member, Comrade Khalida Jarrar, is meant to deliver a message to the Palestinian people and to the Popular Front that they are being targeted by occupation forces.”
He urged national Palestinian action to seriously resist all Zionist crimes, from the ethnic cleansing of Jerusalem, to settlement building, to the targeting of the Palestinian people and national leaders, including pursuing action at the International Criminal Court to prosecute the political and military officials of the occupation as war criminals.
Comrade Shishtari praised Jarrar, noting her consistent struggle against the occupation and defense of the just cause of the Palestinian people whether as a deputy in the PLC or a leader of the PFLP. He also demanded that the Palestinian Authority end security coordination with the occupation.
Reviewing the Palestinian positions and statements issued following the arrest of Jarrar, he emphasized that this indicates a clear Palestinian consensus against the escalating arrests, and noting that this must be met with real unity and earnest work to end Palestinian internal division and confront the occupation.
