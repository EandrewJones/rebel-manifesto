A statement issued by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
To the masses of our people, we mourn the martyrs of the heroic “Promise of al-Buraq” operation
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine mourns the heroes of the village of Deir Abu Mishal, the two struggling comrades and released prisoners:
Bara’a Ibrahim Saleh Atta (18 years old)
Osama Ahmed Mustafa Atta (19 years old)
alongside the heroic martyr:
Adel Hassan Ahmed Ankoush (18 years old)
They carried out the heroic “Promise of al-Buraq” operation on Friday evening in Jerusalem. It was they who cast Molotov cocktails and stones against the attacks of the occupation forces and the settlers on the bypass roads to the Halamish settlement adjacent to the steadfast village of Deir Abu Mishal. In this resistance activity, the martyr Comrade Bara’a was arrested in 2015 for several months, and the martyr Comrade Osama was imprisoned in 2014 for a year, where he was responsible for the imprisoned comrade Cubs (child prisoners).
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine affirmed its renewal of its promise to the Palestinian people, the covenant and the determination to carry forward the resistance until return, liberation and the establishment of our liberated Palestinian state on the entire land of Palestine from the river to the sea, with Jerusalem as its liberated, united capital.
Glory to the martyrs; victory is inevitable!
