Youth and student organizations of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Palestine and in diaspora strongly condemn the criminal bombings in the southern suburbs of Beirut, in the home of glory and resistance. This heinous massacre perpetrated by the hands of murder and crime against our people in Lebanon, is a massacre perpetrated against the people of the resistance that defeated the Zionist enemy and rubbed his nose in the dirt, is a massacre perpetrated against the Palestinian people, and is a massacre against all those who are committed to resistance until liberation as the only way to defeat the Zionist occupation and settler colonial project in Palestine and the Arab region.
The student and youth organizations of the PFLP reaffirm their solidarity with the Lebanese people and the Lebanese resistance, and emphasize that the fingerprints of the Zionist enemy and its collaborators are clearly visible on this bloody scene. The battle between the occupier and its tools on the one hand and between the forces of resistance and liberation on the other hand is a long and difficult fight, that will end with the achievement of victory for our people. The objective of this massacre is to divert once again the popular compass of the nation away from the Palestinian cause as a central issue, and to divert attention from the rising intifada in occupied Palestine.
The student and youth organizations of the PFLP call on all youth and students in the Arab nation, from the Atlantic to the Gulf, to be vigilant and aware and not misled and dragged by misinformation and deception from Washington, the Zionist entity and all their tools in the region.
Glory to the martyrs, healing to the wounded, victory to the resistance
