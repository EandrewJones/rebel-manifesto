Comrade Dr. Maher Taher, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and leader of its branch in exile, strongly condemned Palestinian and Arab figures participating in the Zionist Herzliya conference, which will take place in February 2012.
Saeb Erekat, Palestinian Authority negotiator, Riad al-Khoury, a Jordanian economist, Salman al-Sheikh of the Doha-based Brookings Institute, Sherif al-Diwany, chairman of Marsad (Observatory) Inc. in Egypt, and others, are scheduled to speak at the conference. Palestinian figures such as Salam Fayyad and Yasser Abed Rabbo have spoken at the conference, which sees itself as a key center for planning Zionist security and political strategy, in past years.
Taher said that “Participation in such conferences held by the Zionist entity, whose purpose is to strategize to destroy the Palestinian people, liquidate their national rights, and plan for control of the entire region, constitutes a great service to the Zionist project and a betrayal of the just struggle of the Palestinian people.” Taher called for a boycott of all such conferences, a clear line against normalization, and for the Herzliya conference’s aggressive aims to be exposed.
