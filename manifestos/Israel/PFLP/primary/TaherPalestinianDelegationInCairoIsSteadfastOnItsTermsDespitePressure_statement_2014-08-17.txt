The political battle taking place in Cairo is a continuation of the military battle waged by the resistance on the battlefield, said Comrade Maher al-Taher, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, in an interview with Al-Mayadeen TV.
He said that the Palestinian delegation remains united on its terms and conditions, the conditions of the people and the resistance, noting that the Zionist state is the one which, as always, is intransigent and attempting to prolong the negotiations indefinitely while denying Palestinian rights.
The Palestinian people are steadfast and committed to resistance, and will carry on the battle if the negotiations in Cairo fail, Taher said, noting that the Palestinian delegation in Egypt is being subject to considerable pressure in an attempt to undermine its position.
