Comrade Maher al-Taher condemned the official Arab silence on the continued Zionist aggression on occupied Palestine, which has led to the murder of tens of martyrs, including children, and hundreds of wounded, the demolishing of homes and destruction of infrastructure, while the Arab League has not moved a muscle, confirming its transformation into a corpse.
“The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine urges political parties, national leaders and popular Arab forces to mobilize the broad public in Arab capitals to express their support for the steadfast Palestinian people and their condemnation of the treacherous Zionist aggression,” he said. The PFLP has previously called for an end to normalization, the withdrawal of Arab ambassadors from the Zionist state, and the closure and ejection of Zionist embassies in Arab countries.
Taher also called upon all of the supporters of freedom and justice in the world to condemn the crimes committed by the terrorist leaders in Tel Aviv.
He emphasized that the Palestinian people, in the West Bank, Gaza, Jerusalem, Haifa, Yafa, Akka, Nazareth and throughout occupied Palestine will confront the aggression with resistance and steadfastness, and prove to the Zionist terror leaders and settlers that they will pay dearly for their brutality and crimes.
