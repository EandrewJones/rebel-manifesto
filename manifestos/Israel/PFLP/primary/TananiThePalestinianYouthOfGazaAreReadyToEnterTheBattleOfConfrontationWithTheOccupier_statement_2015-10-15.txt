Comrade Ahmad Tanani, member of the Central Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and secretary of the Progressive Student Labor Front in Gaza, sent his salutes to the young Palestinian men and women carrying out resistance operations shaking the occupation state, its soldiers and settlers, denouncing the curfew and closure imposed on Jerusalem.
“The Zionist occupation believes that they can escalate, kill Palestinians, remove them from the city of Jerusalem and the holy sites, arrest them, and that this will suceed in stpping the uprising. However, the masses of our people are moving toward a massive popular uprising and the occupation will not be able to stop them.” He urged the formation of a unified national leadership of the uprising and the organization of joint work among all national and Islamic forces in all aspects of struggle.
“From Gaza, we went on marches toward the points of contact to confront the Zionist occupation, and were hit with bullets and tear gas, and suffered many injuries and martyrs in the confrontations. Gaza will remain a thorn in the throat of the occupation. No matter how they try to separate us from the rest of our people or stifle us through siege and closure, we remain linked to the rest of occupied Palestine, by blood, spirit and identity, and these clashes with the occupation forces are a message that the youth of the Gaza Strip and its resistance fighters are ready to enter the battle with the occupation and affirm the unity of our land, and embody the unity of our struggle,” said Tanani.
