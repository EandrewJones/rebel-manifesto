July 4 – Comrade Hani Thawabteh, member of the Central Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said that the Palestinian people must unite to confront the occupation threats, calling for the military wings of the Palestinian resistance factions to unite to build a unified resistance front to plan the nature of its response to occupation attacks, in an interview with Al-Alam television.
“It is clear that the Zionist enemy is in the process of launching a new aggression on Gaza; the indicators of this aggression became clear several days ago, when the Gaza Strip was bombed heavily through the night until the early morning hours.”
Thawabteh said that any attempt to re-occupy the Gaza Strip is a project of defeat that will cost the occupation dearly. “Aggression on Gaza will involve limited partial invasions in some areas of the Gaza Strip and the intensification of airstrikes targeting Palestinian institutions, buildings, and leaders of political factions….The primary objective of this aggression is to subdue the resistance and to destroy its resources and capacity, which have grown in recent years and now enable it to hit deep inside the Zionist entity.”
Furthermore, Thawabteh said that the Zionist occupation government is in an internal state of confusion and pressure inside, and so is escalating its aggression on the Palestinian people in a failing attempt to assure its public that the Zionists control all of Palestine and are able to suppress resistance.
