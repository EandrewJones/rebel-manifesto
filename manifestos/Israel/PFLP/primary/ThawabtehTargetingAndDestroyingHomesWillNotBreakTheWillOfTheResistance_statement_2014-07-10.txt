Comrade Hani Thawabteh, a leader in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, saluted the Palestinian people, especially the Palestinians in Gaza, who are facing one of the most severe attacks in the long history of Zionist attacks on the Palestinian people, emphasizing that there is no substitute for struggle and resistance in all forms, methods and at all levels for the Palestinian people.
In an interview with Sawt al-Shaab (Voice of the People) radio, Thawabteh noted that the Zionist enemy had targeted the home of Comrade Marwan Abu Nasr, a member of the Central Committee of the PFLP, for bombing by an F-16, US-made airplane. Comrade Abu Nasr’s home was destroyed entirely. Thawabteh noted that this tactic of home demolitions through aerial bombing is being used repeatedly all over Gaza as a brutal, murderous method of aggression against the Palestinian people, but that this tactic will not undermine the determination of the Palestinian people, or that of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. “The PFLP will keep fighting alongside our people and the resistance factions until victory over the Zionist enemy,” Thawabteh said.
The Front will keep fighting until the Zionist enemy is defeated in Palestine, and until the liberation of all of our occupied Palestine, the return of the refugees, self-determination and the establishment of a Palestinian state with full sovereignty over every inch of the land of Palestine with Jerusalem as its capital.
