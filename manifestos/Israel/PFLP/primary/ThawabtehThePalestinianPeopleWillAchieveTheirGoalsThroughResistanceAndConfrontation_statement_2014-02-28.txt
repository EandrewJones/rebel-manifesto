Comrade Hani Thawabteh, member of the Central Committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said that the Zionist enemy understands only the language of force and confrontation and that the Palestinian people will only achieve their goals by confronting the enemy and resisting.
Thawabteh, speaking with Al-Quds TV, said that “the resistance program is a realistic and practical alternative to the program of sterile negotiations which have achieved nothing for the Palestinian people and are part of the attempt to impose a U.S./Zionist project on the Palestinian people.” He noted that Kerry’s plan represents the clear adoption of the full vision of Zionist security, and perpetuates settlements and occupation.
Further, he noted, “this proposal violates Resolution 194, which provides for the return of all refugees to their homes which they were expelled in addition to their right to compensation. This scheme aims to liquidate and cancel the right of return.” Thawabteh said that “Kerry and the U.S. will not bring our people their inalienable rights. They will not dry the tears of a Palestinian refugee child in Yarmouk, Baddawi, Bureij, Nuseirat or Jabalya.”
He said that Palestinian national interests must be placed above narrow and individual interests, and as such, a comprehensive national dialogue to end internal division and build a political strategy to confront aggression and to act at all levels to struggle for the rights of our people, in particular the right of return.
