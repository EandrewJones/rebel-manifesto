The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine salutes and mourns the young martyr, Imam Jamil Dweikat, the boy who was murdered on Monday by Israeli occupation soldiers who shot him in cold bloods. His blood and the blood of all  of those who have fallen for Palestine will not be shed in vain; we will continue the struggle to liberate our land from this occupier.

The PFLP confirmed that responding to this crime and the ongoing Zionist escalation requires all of us to escalate the resistance in all forms and strengthen a unified Palestinian position to  uphold the rights of our people and the constants of our cause.

The PFLP demanded the Palestinian official leadership end its exclusivity and domination on critical  decisions, which requires the immediate withdrawal of the draft submitted to the United Nations Security Council which threatens Palestinian rights and constants and offers free concessions of critical issues. The alternative program requires the formulation of national strategy that brings the Palestinian cause to the United Nations to deal with it on the basis of the implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy and our legitimate rights without compromising any of the rights of our people especially on the issues of the right of Palestinian refugees to return and the right of self-determination. In addition, the Front emphasizes the need to join all international institutions, especially  the International Criminal Court, to put the occupation on trial for their crimes against the Palestinian people, including their crime today against Imam Dweikat.

The Front demanded that the Authority and its security forces must end security coordintion and all relations with the Zionist occupation, and end political arrests, which have been escalating even more in the last period, especially targeting journalists.

The Front emphasized the need to end the division and build Palestinian unity, including supporting and sustaining our internal front to protect the Palestinian people from any potential escalations and adventures of the Zionist occupation linked to their game of elections.
