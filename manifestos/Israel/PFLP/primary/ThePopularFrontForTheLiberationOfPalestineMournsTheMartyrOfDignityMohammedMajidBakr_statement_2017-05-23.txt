With great pride, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) mourns its son, the heroic martyr Mohammed Majid Bakr, whose pure soul has joined the souls of the martyrs after he was targeted by Zionist gunboats and shot down in cold blood.
These ongoing crimes against humanity of the Zionist enemy target our people day after day in front of the world which stands silent in front of this brutality and barbarism. These actions show once more that this enemy only understands the language of force and the voice of the Palestinian resistance.
The Front emphasized that this crime against the fishermen who seek to feed and provide for their families reflects the extent of the racism and fascism of the Zionist enemy which continues to hunt down the fishermen and subject them to killings, attacks and oppression at all levels, either through targeting and arrests or through the confiscation of their boats.
The Front called upon all to confront these ongoing crimes and hold the occupation accountable for this racist policy, including bringing occupation officials before the International Criminal Court. Action is necessary to deter the occupier from its ongoing crimes and strengthen the steadfastness of the Palestinian fishermen. Palestinian fishermen need international protection and support. In recent years, dozens have suffered injury, arrest and even death, with significant material losses to the fishermen, especially the destruction and sinking of fishing boats.
The Popular Front, as it mourns the heroic martyr Mohammed Majid Bakr, salutes his family, who exemplify the meaning of national solidarity and struggle, amid the loss of one of the precious sons of this struggling family, who have given dozens of their children for Palestine and their belief in its just cause. We commit ourselves to confront and expose all practices of the enemy against the fishermen and our peopleâ€™s rights in general.
