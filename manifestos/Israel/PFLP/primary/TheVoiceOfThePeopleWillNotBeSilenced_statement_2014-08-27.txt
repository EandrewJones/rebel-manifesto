As part of the Zionist enemy’s continued barbaric aggression against our people for 51 consecutive days, the studio of the Voice of the People Radio station, the national democratic progressive voice in the Gaza Strip, was attacked and destroyed in the al-Basha building. This attack comes in conjunction with mass arrests of the Popular Front in the West Bank and the thirteenth anniversary of the martyrdom of the Front’s General Secretary, Abu Ali Mustafa, who was assassinated by enemy helicopter-fired missiles. All of these events are part and parcel of a concerted campaign to silence the voice of the Palestinian resistance.
The Zionist entity is continuing its war crimes and genocide against the Palestinian people, its institutions, its public and private property, and is targeting media organizations, journalists, their homes and workplaces in order to stop them from transmitting the truth of the criminal assault against our people.
From under the bombs, we urge international institutions and media rights organizations to take their responsibilities to stop this aggression and the occupation’s assaults on journalists and the press, which violate all forms of international humanitarian law and human rights conventions, and the professional protection of journalists that enables them to perform their duties.
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine denounces this criminal aggression on the Palestinian media, which aims to crush human freedoms. 17 journalists have been murdered by the occupation’s assault. We demand international prosecution of the occupation and its leaders to hold them accountable and bring them to justice for their ongoing crimes.
