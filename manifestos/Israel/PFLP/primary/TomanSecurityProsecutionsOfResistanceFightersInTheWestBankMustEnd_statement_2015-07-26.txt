Comrade Mohammed Toman, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said that “the continuing [Palestinian Authority] security prosecutions of resistance fighters and militants in the West Bank is unacceptable ethically and nationally.”
Speaking on behalf of the National and Islamic Forces, Toman noted that “the Palestinian Authority has not, to this moment, implemented the decision of the PLO Central Council, demanding an end to security coordination with the occupation. Coordination between the security forces and the occupation are continuing until this moment. In order to confront the actions of the occupier against the Palestinian people in the West Bank, and most recently, the construction of new colonies, security coordination must be ended immediately. Instead, it is time to complete the Palestinian reconciliation and implement signed agreements among the Palestinian factions for national unity and struggle.”
“Palestinian reconciliation is not primarily about a government being formed, but the framework of the new provisional leadership of the PLO, representing all Palestinian factions, must come together to develop a clear political vision to serve the aspirations and needs of the Palestinian people,” said Toman.
