We call for a day of massive popular anger against the occupationâ€™s attacks on prisoners in Nafha prison
In light of the systematic campaign of brutal escalation against Palestinian prisoners by the prison authorities and intelligence agencies, especially in Nafha prison, and after the storming of a number of sections in Nafha prison by heavily armed special repressive units several days ago, which caused dozens of injuries among prisoners; and in light of the repetition of this attack today, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine branch in Israeli prisons urges the masses of the Palestinian people in Palestine and in diaspora, and the free people of the world, to organize days of popular anger against the occupation beginning tomorrow, Thursday, April 21. These days of anger come in support of the prisoners struggling to confront the attacks by the Zionist prison administration and to support the prisoners in Nafha prison facing violent attack.
