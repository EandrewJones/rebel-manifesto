Comrade Khalida Jarrar, deputy in the Palestinian Legislative Council and leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, announced on September 16 that the occupation’s order to expel her to the city of Jericho effectively ended the previous day after the military court revised the expulsion order from six months to one month, which then expired.
Jarrar spoke at a press conference in the permanent solidarity tent she erected in the yard of the Palestinian Legislative Council in Ramallah, in protest as she refused to abide by the expulsion order. She immediately moved to the protest tent on August 20 after the order was delivered by over 50 armed occupation soldiers invadint her Ramallah home.
Jarrar said that the rejection of the occupation’s order, the public pressure campaign and the international solidarity movement around her case forced the occupier to back down and yield to these pressures. She saluted all of the international parliamentarians and organizations who rejected the expulsion order and supported her rejection of the unjust action, noting the widespread recognition of the illegitimate and illegal order by Arab and international forces.
Omar Nazzal read a statement on behalf of the Committee in Solidarity with Khalida Jarrar, noting that dozens of delegations have flocked to the protest tent, organized sit-ins at the UN building, and engaged in a public and media campaign at the Palestinian and international levels.
The Committee considers this to be a victory for the Palestinian national cause, not simply Khalida Jarrar as an individual said Nazzal, noting that there is popular strength and willpower confronting the occupier.
