The Jordanian Democratic Popular Unity Party (Wihda Party) denounced the arrests of anti-Zionist and anti-normalization activists in Jordan on January 13, noting that about a dozen members of the Kalouti group (known as “JK”) were detained for a day by Jordanian security forces, preventing them from holding their weekly sit-in outside the Zionist embassy in Jordan in rejection of the Wadi Araba normalization treaty.
These measures come as a continuation of the ongoing approach of the government, including the restriction of freedoms and prohibiton of events and detention of activists, especially to prevent events outside the United States embassy, in solidarity with Al-Mayadeen and other targeted Arab satellite channels, and now the Kalouti demonstrations against the Zionist embassy.
The party noted that these actions are not simply a violation of civil freedoms and public rights but also an attempt by the state to suppress the broad popular rejection of the Wadi Araba treaty, working hand in hand to meet the demands of the Israeli state to suppress any manifestations of rejection of the occupation state and its embassy on Jordanian land.
The party saluted the comrades and friends in the JK group who have protested near the Zionist embassy weekly for over five years, demanding the abolition of the Wadi Araba treaty and the expulsion of the Zionist ambassador.
