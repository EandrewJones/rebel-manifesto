A special unit of the Prison Services broke into one of the prisoners’ rooms yesterday morning in Ramon prison, emptying Section 5 of Palestinian prisoners and redistributing them to other sections and rooms – a “usual inspection” following normal practices.
In this context, the prisoners are continuing to strategize and struggle, studying all means to end the sanctions imposed upon them. At the present time, Palestinian political prisoners are exploring the possibility of escalating steps of struggle and collective protest in order to end the sanctions and improve the conditions of prisoners’ lives, especially those who belong to Hamas, the Popular Front, Islamic Jihad, the Democratic Front and the People’s Party, considering that these prisoners are most impacted by the sanctions that have been imposed upon the prisoners following the disappearance of three settlers in Hebron in June 2014.
These steps of protest will be initiated in response to the ongoing delays and evasions of the prison authorities in regard to repeated calls to end the sanctions imposed on prisoners.
With respect to media statements on prisoners and the conditions of their lives, we hope that all will follow reliable sources and try to avoid media hype, inaccuracy and exaggeration.
