The Zionist plan to exchange land in the Triangle area, seeking to exchange territory and population, as reported in Maariv newspaper on the eve of US Secretary of State John Kerry’s visit to the region, is a war crime that should be addressed by all means, said Comrade Dr. Maher al-Taher, member of the Political Bureau of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
The first step in confronting this crime is to immediately end the so-called negotiations being conducted under American auspices, designed to provide cover for Zionist schemes of Judaization, settlement, transfer, and the liquidation of Palestinian national rights, said Taher.
The Zionist plan to exchange land and people seeks the deportation and displacement of 300,000 Palestinians from the Triangle area and seeks to legitimize the settlements in Palestine’s West Bank. Combined with the Knesset bill seeking to annex the Jordan Valley, these actions make clear to all that negotiations are no more than a farce that is completely incompatible with the fundamental interests of the Palestinian people, Taher said.
The PFLP calls on all factions and forces inside and outside Palestine to build comprehensive plans to confront the US/Zionist schemes and end the negotiations, Taher said, also urging Arab popular forces and progressive forces around the world to expose and confront these malicious policies of Zionist terror.
