The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine described the so-called “Breaking the Impasse Initiative” by a self-identified team of Palestinian and Israeli businesspeople, announced on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum for the Middle East and North Africa in Jordan, as a harmful activity that does not serve the Palestinian people’s struggle and is consistent with US pressure and policies to force a Palestinian return to US-led negotiations, bilateral “solutions” and damaging “peace process” under the requirements of the settler government led by Benjamin Netanyahu.
The Front said that this initiative, under which Israeli and Palestinian businessmen are purporting to call upon “the leaders of the two countries to be bold and revive the political process,” equates the occupation with the occupied Palestinian people and attempts to re-invigorate the so-called “negotiated two-state solution,” instead of implementing international law.
The PFLP further condemned the meeting between PA President Mahmoud Abbas with Shimon Peres, head of state of the occupation state, as participating in this marketing of illusions of “peace”, serving to enforce Netanyahu’s policies and the US drive to return to absurd negotiations and impose the recognition of the so-called “state of the Jewish people” in Palestine. The Front demanded that all parties concerned, including businesspeople and independents, to put an end to this chaos and normalization ongoing in their name in yet another attempt to liquidate the Palestinian cause.
