The Pridnestrovien Moldavian Republic attentively examined reaction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration of the Republic of Moldova to the decision of the Russian Federation to open polling stations at the forthcoming elections to the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian   Federation in Pridnestrovie due on December 4, 2011.
The Pridnestrovien side marks that decision on opening polling stations in Pridnestrovie was performed  in full measure in accordance with legislation of the Russian Federation and the Pridnestrovien Moldavian Republic, as well as international standards in the sphere of human rights provision, and in no degree touches upon “sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova”.
It should be reminded that there is nothing unexpected in the reaction of official Kishinev. Position of authorities of the Republic of Moldova in previous periods connected with organization of elections of the President and deputies of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation on the territory  of Pridnestrovie was the same as today.
Therefore, we cannot but point out retention of alarming malpractice which lies in aspiration of the Moldovan authorities to restrict rights of the citizens residing in Pridnestrovie. Detailed information on such practice was conveyed to UN High Commissioner on Human Rights and delegation of guarantor countries, mediators and observers in the Moldova-Pridnestrovie settlement at the beginning of November 2011.
We are convinced that attempts of politically motivated violations of human rights made by Moldova's authorities have no grounds or justification, and fail to promote development of constructive interaction between all parties concerned.
The Pridnestrovien Moldavian Republic reaffirms that elections of deputies of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation on the territory of Pridnestrovie will be held, as before, at high organizational level in the framework of fruitful interaction of authorized organs of Russia and Pridnestrovie.
