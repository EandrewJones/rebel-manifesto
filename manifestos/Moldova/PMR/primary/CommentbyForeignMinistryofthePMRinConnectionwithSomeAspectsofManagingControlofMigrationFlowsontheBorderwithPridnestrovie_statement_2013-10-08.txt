As the official web-site of the Foreign Ministry of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic previously informed, on October 7, 2013, representatives of the Permanent Conference carried out introductory visit to the territorial office of the Bureau for Migration and Asylum of the Republic of Moldova located near Gyrbovets village.
The foreign office of Pridnestrovie expresses concern about the fact that placing five migration check points in the Security Zone – which are in fact full-fledged infrastructure facilities equipped to carry out different forms of control on the border – was not coordinated with the Joint Control Commission.
According to the information provided by the Moldovan side, territorial offices of the Bureau for Migration and Asylum of Moldova will be used solely for the purposes of migration registration of foreigners arriving in Moldova from/via Ukraine. However, regardless of the name of the facility and its declared purpose, it is clear that its current functions will be defined by the domestic law of the Republic of Moldova and therefore can be changed at any time towards sufficient enhancement of forms of control.
Actions of the Republic of Moldova uncoordinated with the JCC raise separate concern in the context of the work of mobile groups of border police of the Republic of Moldova which has begun, with their powers and actions in the Security Zone being still unclear.
Pridnestrovian MFA expresses hope for these questions to be discussed at length by the sides in the framework of the Joint Control Commission in the near future.
