The Ministry of Foreign Affairs got acquainted with the Office of the Representative for Political Affairs of the Republic of Moldova information message which states that Pridnestrovie did not allegedly respond about a regular meeting of Expert (Working) Groups on health issues holding.
This information is incorrect since the answer was indeed sent on April 8.
In a detailed letter, the Pridnestrovian side particularized the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic’s practical experience in countering the coronavirus infection spread. Recommendations that proved to be highly effective were emphasized, especially with regard to the timely introduction of a quarantine regime for border crossing, the widespread use of personal protective equipment for medical staff and the safe quarantine accommodations arrangements for physicians who directly work with infected patients. An emphasis was made to the openness for cooperation, which is carried out at the level of specialists on a daily basis. 
Pridnestrovie counts on Moldovan experts to have a careful analysis of the experience gained. If the Moldovan leadership would timely applicate similar measures to counter the pandemic there could have been a very positive effect on the epidemiological situation in the neighboring republic.
It is also worth noting that today the PMR Ministry of Foreign Affairs received an appeal from the political representative of the Republic of Moldova informing about the refusal to hold the meeting of Expert subgroup on banking issues and to solve the problem of blocking the PMR citizens’ access to international payment systems cards, explaining this by fact that the period of April 7-17 in Moldova is inoperative for most of state institutions employees of the Republic of Moldova.
We urge the Moldovan side to take a distinct position and manage to the real readiness for expert work without imaginary obstacles.
