In connection with the position defined by the MFAEI of the RM regarding appointment of Dmitry Rogozin as a Special Representative of the President of the Russian Federation for Pridnestrovie, we deem it necessary to clarify several aspects taking into account a longstanding process of the Moldova-Pridnestrovie relations settlement. Pursuant to Agreement on the Principles of a Peaceful Settlement of the Conflict signed in 1992, the Russian   Federation carries out a peacekeeping mission and is a guarantor country in the settlement process of the Moldova-Pridnestrovie conflict - the fact which predetermines its official position.
Considering references of the foreign office of Moldova on the need to comply with international-legal documents, we find it important to remind of the Memorandum on the Bases for Normalization of Relations between the Republic of Moldova and Pridnestrovie which was signed on May 8, 1997, by the President of the Republic of Moldova including. In accordance with Article 3 of this document, Pridnestrovie has the right on a free-standing basis to establish and maintain international contacts in economic, scientific-technical, cultural and other spheres.
The Russian Federation is an independent subject of international law and a party to the above mentioned document, and its sovereign decisions as to the forms and parameters of cooperation with Pridnestrovie are seen as logical and grounded. In our opinion, this decision of the President of the Russian  Federation fully corresponds to the official position of Russia as a participant of the Moldova-Pridnestrovie settlement aimed at protection of interests of more than 160 thousand citizens of the Russian Federation residing in Pridnestrovie.
We suppose that a more systemic and many-sided involvement of guarantor countries in the process of relations normalization between Pridnestrovie and Moldova will promote speedy search for the model of a peaceful and fair resolution of the conflict.Â
