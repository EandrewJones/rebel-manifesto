The Pridnestrovian side noted the specific reaction of the Moldovan Political Representative’s Office to the official appeal of Pridnestrovie to ensure the implementation of the electoral right of citizens of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic within the Single Voting Day on November 29, 2020.
Recall, on the eve of presidential elections in Moldova, the Moldovan side did twice address analogical appeals to Pridnestrovie, including ensuring the delivery of mobile ballot boxes. International participants in the negotiation process asked granting the request as well. In both cases, the Pridnestrovian side accommodated the Republic of Moldova with.
However, there’s no Moldovan Political Representative’s official answer to the subject matter in question, and that threatens the prospects for implementing the principle of universal and equal voting rights, enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international documents.
We call on international partners to pay attention to the emerging alarming situation and provide assistance so that not to let any provocations happen on the voting day and for them to call on the Moldovan authorities not to hinder the implementation of fundamental rights of Pridnestrovian citizens to elect and be elected.
Together with, in order to exclude inappropriate interpretations about elections to Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic’s representative bodies, we would recommend the Kishinev representatives to attentively get familiar with the Agreement content, signed in March 2020, between Pridnestrovian Supreme Court and the Parliament of Moldova.
