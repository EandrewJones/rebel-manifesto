In connection with Mikhail Bergman's comments on history of Moldo-Pridnestrovien conflict, on some aspects of settlement and on the events of inner political life of the PMR spread today by some Internet resources, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PMR informs that the interview represents Mister Bergman's private opinion and does not reflect the official position of the state authorities of the PMR.
In connection with the incoming questions which we receive from the journalists, the MFA of the PMR explains that the interview, broadcasted by the Moldovan TV channel, which appeared on March 12, 2012, is archival and, according to MFA's sources, had been given before Mister Bergman assumed his current duties in the Presidency of the PMR.
