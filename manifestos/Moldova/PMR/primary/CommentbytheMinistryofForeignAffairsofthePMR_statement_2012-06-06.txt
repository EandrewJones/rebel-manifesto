In connection with the publications appearing in some Moldovan mass media regarding allegedly existing “black lists” and announcement of a number of businessmen of the Republic of Moldova “persona non grata” in Pridnestrovie, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PMR finds it necessary to note that the given information does not reflect the actual situation.
We note with satisfaction that unreliable information was rather quickly confuted by representatives of Moldovan European Business Association which turned to be in the middle of this media action.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PMR states that there are no restrictive lists or special orders in Pridnestrovie relating to the given Association, likewise other non-governmental organizations cooperating with business-structures and other public organizations of the Pridnestrovian  Moldavian Republic.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PMR declares that foreign political office has rendered and will continue to render a whole range of necessary measures of assistance to foreign delegations, acting within its powers and in strict correspondence with the legislation of the Pridnestrovian  Moldavian Republic.
