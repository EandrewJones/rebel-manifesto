In connection with the tragic incident which took place in the Security Zone on January 1, 2012, PMR's MFA extends its sincere condolences to the man's family and relatives and empathizes with the tragic loss.
We think that hasty conclusions regarding activity of the peacekeeping mission in the context of what has happened may demonstrate some aspects of political pressure, which is unacceptable. It is necessary to examine all problematic issues at the negotiation table after the corresponding conclusion on the investigation results.
The peacekeeping mission performed on the banks of the Dniester is the most important guarantee of peace and security in the region. We express our hope for human wisdom of the actors involved in coverage process of the course of investigation.Â
