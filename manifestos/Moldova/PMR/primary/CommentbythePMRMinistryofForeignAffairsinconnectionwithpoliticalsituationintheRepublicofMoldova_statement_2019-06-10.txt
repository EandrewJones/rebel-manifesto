Pridnestrovie pays close attention to the ongoing political confrontation in the Republic of Moldova and calls political forces of neighbouring country to be restraint and to ensure peace and stability.
We express the hope that the worsening political crisis will not harm the ability of the Republic of Moldova to implement the agreements in the negotiating process that focused on solving urgent social and humanitarian issues in the interests of the people.
