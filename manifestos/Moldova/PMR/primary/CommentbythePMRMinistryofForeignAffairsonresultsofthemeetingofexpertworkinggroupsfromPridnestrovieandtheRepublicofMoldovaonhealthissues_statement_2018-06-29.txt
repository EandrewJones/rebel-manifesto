The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PMR is extremely concerned about results of the meeting of expert (working) groups from Pridnestrovie and Moldova on health issues held yesterday, June 28, 2018, in the OSCE Mission office in Chisinau.
At the meeting, the parties discussed problems of importing medicines into Pridnestrovie. As known, the nomenclature of medicines allowed for import in Pridnestrovie and Moldova varies greatly due to the significant volumes of imports to the PMR from the Russian Federation, Ukraine and the Republic of Belarus. Thus, activities of the relevant experts in this field are expected to be aimed at finding ways to overcome the potential negative consequences of these differences in the partiesâ€™ registries.
Despite this, during the meeting, the representatives of the Republic of Moldova adopted an uncompromising position, pointing out that from July 18, 2018 only medicines listed in the state register of the Republic of Moldova will be able to enter the territory of the PMR through the Kuchurgan border crossing point.
At the same time, according to the information received by the PMR Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a few days before the meeting of experts, the customs service of the Republic of Moldova began to exert pressure on the pharmaceutical companies of Pridnestrovie, saying that Pridnestrovian legal entities will be required to present a complete set of Moldovan documents to import medicines into the PMR through the Kuchurgan checkpoint since July 18, including authorization documents for the import of medical products.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PMR draws attention to the fact that by its actions the Moldavian side also jeopardizes import of medical products that are already purchased by state health institutions, as well as pharmaceutical companies.
In this context, the PMR Foreign Ministry has already appealed to all participants in the 5+2 format to engage immediately in the emerging situation and prevent a possible blockade of imports of medicines into Pridnestrovie. The PMR Ministry of Foreign Affairs is convinced of the need for rapid response by international mediators due to the unconstructive position taken by the Moldovan side on this extremely important humanitarian issue, late solution of which may bring us to unpredictable negative consequences.
