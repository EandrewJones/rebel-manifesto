The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PMR welcomed the decision of the Moldovan side to facilitate accommodation and professional conditions on the territory of the Republic of Moldova for the medical staff concerned during the lockdown.
The Pridnestrovian side has initially been consistent in proposing this recommendation to Moldovan representatives and welcomes this long-overdue decision taking into account the international and Pridnestrovian experience in coronavirus infection containment based on peopleâ€™s life and health care.
We expect this situation to be recognized and understood by the Moldovan representatives, thereby eliminating any politicization and bureaucratization of routine issues given a global pandemic response.
Pridnestrovie is open to a constructive cooperation on the whole range of issues in the best interests of public health and traditionally aims at finding mutually beneficial pragmatic solutions.
