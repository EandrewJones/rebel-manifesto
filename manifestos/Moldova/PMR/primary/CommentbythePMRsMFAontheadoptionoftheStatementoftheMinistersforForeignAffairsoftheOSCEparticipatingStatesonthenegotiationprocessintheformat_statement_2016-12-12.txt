The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pridnestrovie has taken note of the Statement of the Ministerial Council of the OSCE participating States concerning the negotiations on the Pridnestrovian settlement, adopted in Hamburg on 8-9 December 2016.
We consider another declaration of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the OSCE participating States as an abstract document, which has no direct relation to the negotiation process between Pridnestrovie and the Republic of Moldova.
Considering assessment in the statement in regards to the agreements, documented by the members of the negotiation process, namely the Protocol of the Berlin meeting of the “Permanent Conference...” on 2-3 June 2016, the Pridnestrovian side reminds that this document contains an exhaustive list of the principles underlying the resolution of some priority problems in relations between Pridnestrovie and the Republic of Moldova. In this respect the PMR’s MFA urges the negotiation process participants, which are also OSCE participating States, to refrain from interpreting liberally the provisions and the context of the Berlin Protocol.
We hope that the consolidated appeal of the Ministers of the OSCE participating States to the parties for regular participation in the 5+2 meetings will be a direct guide to action for the OSCE itself in terms of meeting its commitments on rhythmic organization and holding of the “Permanent Conference...” meetings. For our part we consider the half-yearly pause in the negotiations at the level of the “Permanent Conference...” unreasonable and unacceptable.
We do not find a rational explanation for apparent inaction of some participants in the negotiating process, in these circumstances the Moldovan side has not only refused to fulfill the obligations assumed, but also increased the pressure on Pridnestrovie, substantially worsening socio-economic situation of the Republic inhabitants.
