The press service of the PMR Foreign Ministry was surprised to read unweighted statements of the RM Government member Irene Vlach published in Moldovan media concerning the ongoing negotiation process between Moldova and Pridnestrovie.
We emphasize that the configuration of the Permanent Conference on Political Issues in the Framework of the Pridnestrovian Settlement Negotiation Process is historically developed on the basis of balance of interests and acceptable to all official participants of the international format “5+2”. In this sense, it is difficult to seriously consider any subjective wishes regarding introduction of any foreign elements in the format.
We note that the “5+2” format, contrary to the Moldovan official’s distorted understanding, does not deal with “the reintegration of the Republic of Moldova”. In this context, we consider the thesis on the use of a little-known “successful Gagauzia’s experience” as, to put it mildly, comical and quite detached from reality. Moreover, such statements of Moldovan officials seem paradoxical against the background of expansion of migration from Gagauzia to Pridnestrovie, mainlly for employment and quality education in the Russian language.
