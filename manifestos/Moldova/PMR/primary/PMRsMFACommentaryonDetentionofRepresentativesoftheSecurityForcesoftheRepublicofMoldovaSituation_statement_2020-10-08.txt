On October 7, 2020, the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic law enforcement agencies detained a group of people for committing a number of crimes on the territory of Pridnestrovie; it is to be noted that two of them are being active members of the security forces of the Republic of Moldova.
Certain political forces in Moldova tried to speculate on the situation for electoral purposes. As you know, Pridnestrovie takes a principled position of non-interference in internal political processes in the neighboring state.
A telephone conversation between the Presidents of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic and the Republic of Moldova took place today; interlocutors reaffirmed their mutual adherence to the principles of constructive dialogue and humanity. Meeting the Moldovan sideâ€™s requests, the Pridnestrovian law enforcement agencies refrained from using arrests as preventive punishment in relation to representatives of the Moldovan security forces who were released from custody.
At the same time, all the necessary procedural actions will be implemented in full compliance with the legislation of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic.
