On April 4, 2015 the Moldovan news agency «Newsmaker.md» posted a message with a reference to an interview with representative on political issues from the Republic of Moldova Viktor Osipov to the “Radio Moldova” in the programme “Loc de dialog” that on April 21, 2015 in Vienna “the negotiations on Pridnestrovian settlement in the format “5+2” will  resume”.
Due to the inaccuracy made accidentally or intentionally by the official representative of Moldova or the media, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PMR explains that special consultations of the parties were scheduled to be held on April 21, 2015 in Vienna with the involvement of the delegations of the “5+2” format, aimed at clarifying the attitude of all the participants in the negotiation process to the fulfilment of their earlier obligations.
Pridnestrovie put forward the relevant initiative in January this year, subsequently supported by the mediators in the settlement and the Moldovan side.
These special consultations are not an official meeting of the “Permanent Conference ...” in the “5+2” format. The need for them has been dictated by a number of unfriendly blocking measures faced by Pridnesrovie. From the point of view of the Pridnestrovian side, these measures contradict the earlier reached agreements of the negotiation process and call into question the future prospects of the dialogue, as well as the status and role of its individual participants.
