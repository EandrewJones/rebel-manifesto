In the light of high importance for the Moldova-Pridnestrovie settlement of the Summit of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe held on 1-2 December, in Astana, the refusal of Moldovan acting President Mihai Ghimpu from participating in the given international forum is indicative of Chisinau's extremely irresponsible approach to the question of political normalization of relations. 
Such demarche shows principle unwillingness of the Moldovan leadership to discuss issues of a new security architecture – the fact that speaks for Moldova's mere lack of interest in the construction of a reliable and fair  security system in the framework of “common Europe”, as well as for a direct refusal to assist in the soonest stabilization in the Moldova-Pridnestrovie region. 
The motivation of personal non-involvement in the representative international forum voiced by the highest official of the Republic of Moldova attests the lack of understanding of the modern realities and represents an infantile and arrogant attempt to make unilateral issues be included in the international political agenda. 
In this connection, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Pridnestrovien Moldavian Republic draws attention of the participants of the OSCE Summit to the given position of Moldova, as a participating party of the settlement, which one cannot fail to consider when taking decisions aimed at normalization of regional processes in the context of the Moldova-Pridnestrovie settlement.
