In recent months, the Republic of Moldova, disregarding its obligations within the negotiation process and abandoning the normal working dialogue, deliberately raises tensions and arranges provocative actions on the border with the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic.
Pridnestrovie has information about provocative actions planned by the Moldovan side in the Security Zone, targeting inter alia the members of the Joint Peacekeeping Forces, which can seriously destabilize the situation and lead to unpredictable consequences.
Given the negative trends, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic informed all 5+2 participants and other diplomatic missions about the measures taken by the Pridnestrovian side to prevent a crisis in the Security Zone, and also called upon the international partners for the necessary political and diplomatic facilitation to avert Chisinauâ€™s destabilization plans.
