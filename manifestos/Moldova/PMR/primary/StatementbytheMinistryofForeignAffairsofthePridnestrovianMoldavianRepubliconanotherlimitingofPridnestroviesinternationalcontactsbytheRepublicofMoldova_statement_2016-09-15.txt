​Today, 15 September 2016, Advisor to the Director of the Foreign Policy Cooperation Center n.a. Y.M. Primakov, Advisor to the Alexander Gorchakov Public Diplomacy Fund Yuri Zhmurko and Head of the Department of Cultural and Global Studies at BSTU “Voenmech” n.a. D.F. Ustinov, chief editor of “Geopolitics and Security” journal Igor Fedorovich Kefeli, which intended to travel to Pridnestrovie to participate in the conference, were stopped in the Kishinev Airport and deported to the Russian Federation.
This incident was another demarche of the Moldovan side aiming at limiting diplomatic, scientific and academic contacts of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic. Previous similar incident took place on September 1, when Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Abkhazia Oleg Arshba was deported.
PMR Foreign Ministry considers the incident as another hostile move by the Moldovan side aiming at international isolation of Pridnestrovie, which creates additional difficulties and is worsening the atmosphere of bilateral relations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs calls upon the mediators and observers in the 5+2 negotiation format to give a proper assessment of the provocative actions by Moldova.
