The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PMR informs that the relevant services of Pridnestrovie reported the facts of unsanctioned flight of the Romanian aircraft “Diamond DA-42 Twin Star” through the airspace of Pridnestrovie on April 27, 2016.
According to the information available, the aircraft intruded into the airspace of the PMR by early afternoon and took aerial photography of a number of facilities located on the territory of Pridnestrovie, as well as it crossed the Security Zone 18 times.
The PMR's MFA points to the fact that the flights of the aircraft over the territory of Pridnestrovie were not agreed with any relevant departments of the republic, or in the framework of the Joint Control Commission.
The Pridnestrovian delegation in the JCC informed the Moldovan side in writing about inadmissibility of the unsanctioned flight through the territory of Pridnestrovie. On Thursday, April 21, Pridnestrovie put forward the initiative to hold an emergency meeting of the JCC, specifically dedicated to this issue. On April 22 the Moldovan delegation arrived to the meeting venue in Bendery, but flatly refused to open it.
The PMR’s Foreign Ministry believes that unauthorized flights over the territory of Pridnestrovie, carried out with an uncertain aim and ignoring the existing coordination mechanisms, including within the framework of the peacekeeping operation, involve a proliferation of tension and mutual distrust.
Pridnestrovie's Foreign Ministry calls on the Moldovan side, including the delegation of the Republic of Moldova in the JCC, to review these unconstructive approaches and return to the track of proper interaction in the sphere of ensuring the safety of aircrafts.
In addition, the PMR's MFA addresses other participants in the peacekeeping operation, including observers from the Ukraine and the OSCE Mission, with a request to assess the Republic of Moldova’s unilateral actions, fraught with aggravation of the situation in the Security Zone.
