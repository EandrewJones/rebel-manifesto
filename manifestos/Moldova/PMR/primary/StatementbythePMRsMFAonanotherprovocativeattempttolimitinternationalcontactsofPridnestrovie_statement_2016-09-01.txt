​Today, at the airport of Kishinev Moldova’s border police detained and then deported Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Abkhazia Oleg Nurievich Arshba travelling to Pridnestrovie at the invitation of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic.
It should be noted that the Pridnestrovian side had informed the RM about the planned visit of the foreign guest in advance in accordance with the established procedure. However, despite this fact, the repressive measures were applied to the representative of Abkhazia.
We believe that the incident proves weakness and political immaturity of the Moldovan side, indicating another attempt of the RM to limit international contacts of Pridnestrovie by primitive methods.
We express confidence that this kind of panic demarches will not be able to prevent the gradual development of cooperation between Pridnestrovie and fraternal states, including the Republic of Abkhazia. At the same time we emphasize that actions of the Republic of Moldova complicate the situation in the negotiation process between Pridnestrovie and the Republic of Moldova even more. It is obvious that such “medieval” methods indicate the failure of Kishinev to conduct respectful and substantive dialogue with the Pridnestrovian side at the negotiating table.
We strongly recommend the Moldovan side to critically reconsider the discriminatory paradigm of relations with Pridnestrovie. We also urge the international partners, and especially the participants in the 5+2 format, to give an appropriate assessment of such uncivilized actions of the Republic of Moldova.
