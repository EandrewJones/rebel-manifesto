The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PMR informs about the fact of unjustified detention and thorough personal search of a Pridnestrovian official in Kishinev airport.
So, on December 20, 2015 upon returning from Moscow Co-Chairman of the Joint Control Commission from Pridnestrovie Oleg Belyakov was detained in Kishinev airport by Moldova’s border agencies for additional control measures with the so-called “view to determining whether the admittance of the Pridnestrovian representative to Moldova is possible”.
After more than an hour and a half procedure of inspection of personal belongings and drawing up the border control protocol Pridnestrovie’s JCC Co-Chairman was released from the transit zone of Kishinev airport without providing official explanation or apology.
The Foreign Ministry of Pridnestrovie considers the fact of pressure on the Co-Chairman of the JCC from Pridnestrovie as another provocative demarche of the Moldovan side aimed at the destruction of the foundations of the current peacekeeping operation on the Dniester. The use of such restrictions is directly forbidden by the documents regulating the activities of the peacekeeping operation and the Joint Control Commission. In particular, the use of restrictive measures by RM’s security forces against one of the leaders of the joint peacekeeping operation flagrantly violates Article 5 of the Agreement “On the principles of the peaceful settlement of the armed conflict ...”, and paragraph 9 of the Status of JCC.
The PMR's MFA once again urges the Moldovan authorities to refrain from continuing such destructive practices adversely affecting the nature of relations of the parties, including the situation in the negotiation process.
