As announced today beginning with March 10, current year the Republic of Moldova introduces the ban on entry for foreign citizens and stateless persons not having citizenship or a residence permit in the Republic of Moldova who arrive through the Kishinev airport from countries where cases of coronavirus infection have been recorded.
On the backdrop of this information, the Pridnestrovian side initiated a telephone conversation between representatives on political issues from Pridnestrovie and Moldova in order to obtain clarification on the possible application of these restrictions on Pridnestrovian citizens. During the dialogue, the Moldovan side informed that the residents of Pridnestrovie will continue using the previous border crossing regime established in accordance with the Protocol Decision “On Some Aspects of Freedom of Movement” from February 27, 2014, and that no restrictions or prohibitions will be introduced.
At the same time, we recommend that citizens of Pridnestrovie contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PMR, in case of complications or difficulties while crossing the Republic of Moldova’s state border.
