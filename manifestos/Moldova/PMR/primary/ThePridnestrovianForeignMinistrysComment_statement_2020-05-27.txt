The Pridnestrovian Ministry of Foreign Affairs noticed the awkward statements of the Moldovan representative’s office on political issues as to the effective actions the Pridnestrovian side has taken to return hundreds of citizens of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic home within international transport restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
What astonishes is the emotionally negative reaction of K. Lesnik’s office, a reaction that might signalize Kishinev is irritated by the successful resolution of hundreds of problematic logistic situations that Pridnestrovian citizens found themselves abroad. The reasons of the Republic of Moldova’s discontent lie in the fact that the Moldovan political representative repeatedly ignored the numerous appeals on these problems. The Moldovan side actually withdrew from providing assistance in many critical situations directly related to ensuring people’s inalienable rights and interests.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pridnestrovie traditionally uses all kinds of disponible functional tools to return citizens, including direct operational interaction with foreign ministries, diplomatic and consular missions of foreign states including neighboring Moldova. It is important to note that these structures overwhelmingly proved to be adequate, so they perfectly understood the humanitarian nature and the efficiency degree of questions addressed to them. 
As well known, people's interests are at the root of any international negotiation process and cannot be regarded dependent on politically biased approaches. The Foreign Ministry will continue making every single effort to protect the Pridnestrovian citizens’ rights and interests, including in pandemic emergency situations.
We urge the Moldovan side to abandon the narrow-minded deadlock position, stop politicizing obvious humanitarian issues and return to responsible substantive work in the negotiation process.
