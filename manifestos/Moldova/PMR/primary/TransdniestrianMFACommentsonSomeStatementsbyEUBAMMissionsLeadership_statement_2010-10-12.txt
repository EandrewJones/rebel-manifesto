Media released the statement made by the head of the EUBAM Mission Udo Burkholder which says that reopening of the passenger train Chisinau-Odessa via Pridnestrovien Moldavian Republic is “the EU Mission's success in rendering assistance at the border between Moldova and Ukraine.”
In this regard, the Foreign Ministry of Transdniestria finds it necessary to clarify this issue and draw attention to the following.
Resolving of the most urgent social problem which is the restart of the passenger railway circulation through Moldova and Transdniestria is primarily the merit of the two sides themselves.
As for assistance rendering, a number of the interested participants involved in the discussions on this issue really included representatives of the European Union who considerably contributed to settling this problem, however, according to the information available to us, there were no EUBAM Mission's representatives among them.
