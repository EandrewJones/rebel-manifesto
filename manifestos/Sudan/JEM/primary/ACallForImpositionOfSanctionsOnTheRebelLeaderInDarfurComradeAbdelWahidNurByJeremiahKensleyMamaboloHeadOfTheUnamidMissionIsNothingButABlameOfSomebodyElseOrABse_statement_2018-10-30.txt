A call for Imposition of Sanctions on the rebel leader in Darfur Comrade Abdel Wahid Nur by Jeremiah Kensley Mamabolo Head of the UNAMID Mission isnothing but a Blameof Somebody Else or a BSE!
By Mahmoud A. Suleiman

This article comes against the backdrop of the News mediareportsthat the Leader of the UNAMID tried to exonerate his master of grace the Genocidal CriminalOmer Hassan Ahmedal-Bashir in lieu of theAfrican Union (AU)formulaof “Scratch my Back while ICrutch Yours”while the regime’s Atrocious Crimes in Darfur are in sight and as the International Community Radar remainsoff, dimmed in Darkness.
It seems that the Leader of theUnited Nations – African Union Hybrid Operation Mission in Darfur(UNAMID)hastriedhardto exonerate his master of grace the Genocidal CriminalMarshall Omer Hassan Ahmedal-Bashir in lieu of theAfrican Union (AU)Recipe Formulaof Scratchmy BackandIScratch Yourswhile the regime’s Atrocious Crimes in Darfur areout of thesightofthe International Community Radarandremains Dimmed.
While the Leader of the UNAMID tried to exonerateal-Bashir from his perpetration of the atrocious crimes,the people of Sudanin Darfur and elsewhereare living under oppressive laws and targeted by the same Janjaweed militias that committed the most heinous crimes in Darfur and now given the cloned nickname of Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led by the militia and Mercenary General Mohamed HamdanDogolo – aka- Hamiditithe right hand supporter to Omer al-Bashir who remains fugitive from the international justice and chased by the toothless Correctional Institution at The Hague in the Netherlands Known by itsformalname of International Criminal Court (ICC).
TherecentCallof Mr.Jeremiah Kensley Mamabolo, head of the UNAMID MissionforImposingSanctions ontherebel leader in DarfurComrade Abdel Wahid Nur is nothing buta clear shameful biasin support ofthe ruling regime inSudanand areflectionofdishonestyand lack ofdiplomaticethical code.Thus, the International Community remains repeating the same mantra of  the former South African President Thabo Mbeki who chronically calling for the Sudanese Opposition Factions of both Armed and Civil for his Round Trips to the Ethiopian Capital of Addis Ababa to repeat the same failed Scenario Knowing as Roadmap that leads to nowhere other than the waste of time and more suffering to the Sudanese people in the War Zones and the Prolongation of the War with more killing, Displacement and the Refugee Status for the survivors of the wars of Attrition. This scenario seems to continue foreverbecause in the end, thelonger the issue of Sudan in the Darfur region remainsunsolved the better forthe chairperson of the AU high-level panel on Darfur (AUPD),Mr. Mbeki had the opportunity to receivethe US DollarCurrencies in return to remaining a supporter andan advocate of the war criminal OmerHassan Ahmedal-Bashir, the member of the African Union (AU) Dictators’ Club inthe Ethiopian CapitalAddis Aba ba,for the so-called negotiations that will not lead toany tangibleresults that will solve the issues of the people of Sudanin Darfur, Nuba Mountains and Ingassanaunder the arbitrary rule of three decades under the grip of iron and fire led by the mafiaterroristsdisguised under the slogans of hypocrisy.One of Thabo Mbeki’s clear orientations in helpingand supportingOmeral-Bashir’s crimes is to work hard to enable al-Bashir to run the so-called 2020 elections and to succeed in it to counterfeit their already known results. Theend result would be a rebirth of a neowar criminalin its cloned format but remains as the sameDictatorOmer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, the fugitive from the international justice and the vicious cycle goes on unabatedto the detriment of the rights of the people of Sudanwho have no tangible support from the international community.Andat such a junction,then therewould beno escape or exit from the re-commission of the previous crimes in a more severe way and there will be no solutions for the people of Sudan from the exit of the quagmire, but the popular uprising as great as theGlorious October 21 1964 Revolution to overthrow thearbitrary ruling regime of the National Congress Party(NCP)and throw it intothe dustbin of history and beyondandMove forward to thelong-awaited Democratic rule in which all the citizens of Sudan are equal on the basis of the identity of citizenship.
The call of the head of the UNAMID mission to impose sanctions on Comrade Abdel Wahid Nur ispart of the neverending series of the falsification of the facts on the ground in the Darfur region, where the Sudanese  civilian citizens who have survived the crimes against humanity,  war crimes and genocide continue to live in Makeshift Camps as Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) or as refugee camps in the neighbouring countries for more than 15 years and suffer all forms of  brutality of the Khartoum government and allied cloned Janjaweedmilitiascodenamed Rapid Support Forces (RSF), along with preventing them from receiving humanitarian aid and relief and imposing all kinds of repression and humiliation on them.
Head of the UNAMID Missionremained mute, does not talk about all those crimes that continue to be committed by the government of the genocidal criminal Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, the fugitive from the international justice and wanted to be arrested by the International Criminal Court (ICC) since 2009.
The observation of the behavior and hearing of the statements of the President of UNAMID was not surprising or strange considering the amount of support the ruling regime of Omer al-Bashir receives from the African Union (AU) entity, which is considered the Club of the Presidents of the dictatorships in Africa, where everyone supports the other without thinking about the rights of the people they rule.
The call of the head of the UNAMID mission to impose sanctions on Comrade AbdelWahidNur is no more thantravesty of justice.
The head of the UNAMID mission should be honest when trying to defend the regime led by the genocidal perpetrator, utterly incompetent Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir.The irony of thisbad timeand erain Sudan, ruled by the arbitrary regime,led by thedictator Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashirwho has been quoted as sayingthat one of the best decisions hehas evermade in his life was theestablishmentof the Rapid Support Forces(RSF)militia, basically the notorious Janjaweed militiasheused in Darfur to commitethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity, war crimes andgenocideagainst the civilian Sudanese citizens as revenge for the armedrebelmovements of Darfur, which weredemanding the rights of citizenship to share wealth and powerof the countryand remove the effects of systematic marginalization across the periods since the so-calledIndependence of Sudan from the Anglo-Egyptian colonialism on January 1, 1956.Bashir’s statements have proven beyond doubt the degree of indication of his abject failures over the past three lean decades of his oppressive rule.A further claimsurfaced in some media outlets run by the security entity of the National Congress Party (NCP)of theso-called National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS)is thattheindictmentof al-Bashirwould have the effect of destabilising the regime and pushing Sudan into anarchy. This is extremely doubtful, and in fact the opposite casescenariois more plausible. The present regime in Khartoum has lied repeatedly and has never honoured any of the documents it has signed – whether the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) with the south, the DPA, or eastern peace agreement (EPA, signed in October 2006 with the eastern-front guerrillas)nor the notorious outcome of theDoha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD). Mr.Jeremiah Kensley Mamabolo, head of the UNAMID Mission should recall the fact that the Khartoum regime Chaired by Omer al-Bashir is renounced forrenegingthe foregoing peace agreements signed with the parties in the dispute. Al-Bashir did that through default on, fail to honorthe agreements witnessed by the observers from the international community who appointed Mr.Jeremiah Kensley Mamabolo,tohead the UNAMID Mission!Shame will be on you, Mr. Jeremiah, for your injustice to Comrade Abdel Wahid Mohamed Ahmed El Nour.In doing so, Mr. Jeremiah Kensley Mamabolo Head of the UNAMID Missiontried tobring a résumé with the least appropriate background imaginable for the National Congress Party (NCP) regime which is seeking to whitewash a record of corruption, repression, genocide, terrorism, and discrimination, asJohn Prendergast the Founding Director of the Enough Project and the Co-Founder of The Sentry saidat the arrival of General Mohamed Atta, former Chief Spy Leader of the notorious National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) to Washington DC carrying a Diplomatic Passport as a Sudanese Ambassador to the United States of America.https://www.thedailybeast.com/this-terror-sponsor-just-got-into-the-us-on-a-diplomatic-passport
Quotes about Blaming somebody Else:“Blame is the demonstrated lack of self-respect choosing to deposit one’s negative actions onto others to reinforce one’s view of being of good, fair, and approved”. Byron R. Pulsifer
Kate Summers has been quoted as saying; “If you are looking to inspire people, then blaming is the last thing you want to do”.

Comrade Abdel Wahid Mohamed Ahmed El Nour who has been struggling for the legitimate rightsof hisSudanese people in the region of Darfur who have been subjected by the National Congress Party (NCP) regimeto all kinds of oppression, murder, subjection to chemical warfare in the Jebel Marra territoryand genocide since 2003 will not be deterred by threats of sanctions. Thus,Jeremiah Kensley Mamabolo Head of the UNAMID Mission needs to understand thisand reflect on itonce again thoughtfully.The UN estimates as many as 300,000 people have been killed in the Darfur genocide. According to the best available estimates, there are between 300,000 and 400,000 Darfurians have been killed since the violence began in early 2003.  This is along with the3.3 million displaced persons (IDPs) in Sudan as of 2016 despite the invisible catastrophe, international complicity.http://sudanreeves.org/2017/05/22/displacement-in-sudan-and-darfur-un-figures-continue-to-be-careless-or-inadequate/
Regrettably, UNAMID commander in Darfur recommended to the United Nations Security Council(UNSC)to reduce thesize of theUNAMIDforce because the war has now diminished its effectshave lessenedin the region and then itsfinaldeparturefrom the regionsoonto bedetermined!
Jeremiah Kensley Mamabolo Head of the UNAMID Mission needs to take into account his inflammatory statements based on the whims of the genocidal criminal who is a fugitive from the international justice Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir.

The International Community inaction on Darfur and rapprochement with Sudanese regime in lieu of TheEU’s flawed $200 million migration dealEuropean Union (EU) –Sudan agreement to curb migration from the Horn of Africa Countries, better known as theKhartoum Processwhich has effectively given the (NCP) regime government a green light to use brutal tactics to dismantle the IDP camps in Darfur, displacing once again the nearly 3 million people forced to flee their homes.The end justifies the means, the famous doctrine ofNiccolò Machiavelli, thePrince hasbeen applied by the (EU), the major player in the international community. Thus, theKhartoumProcess works to stem migration fromtheHorn of Africa.https://www.wikitribune.com/article/28592/
Last and not the least,that thereis also clearanda strong link between what the UNAMID commanderis sayingandwhatthe international communityrepresented in theEuropean Union (EU)and in the United States of America(US)according to the interestingintersectswith the ruling regime of the National Congress Party in Sudan.They say that getting rid of the arbitrary regime is difficult, but it is possible no matter how long it takes to travelto achieve thatWish.
