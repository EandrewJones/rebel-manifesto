A Camp they Called Compo – location:Gezira, Sudan
As aforementioned, education is essential as the only hope to break the vicious cycle of the life within the camp. However, the obstacle being the amount of funding provided by the local authorities for the camp children to gain their basic education; this was next to nothing. In other words, the budget overlooked the children from the camps. Therefore, out of good will, school governing bodies, grant the limited spaces on the basis of favouritism. The rest of the kids have to join force with their parents to keep up with the lands maintenance. One does not have to look far to determine the camp residents backgrounds; almost all  descends from the two very regions which the successive central governments neglected and / or waged war against (Darfur and Kordofan).
The camp experience is yet another form of segregation inflected on the marginalised people of Sudan since the beginning of the neocolonialism post 1956 by the elites and their cliques.
