Sudanese intelligence official sacked over remarks on abandoning Islamic lawsMarch 21, 2011 (KHARTOUM) – A prominent Sudanese intelligence official has been sacked from his position due to a widespread controversy over his remarks on the possibility of abandoning Islamic Shar’iah laws in the country if political parties come to consensus to that effect.

Sudan’s National Security Consultancy, an advisory body established in 2009 under the directorship of the country’s former intelligence chief Salah Abdulla Gosh, announced at a late hour on Sunday that its secretary-general, Lieutenant-General Hassab Allah Omar Al-Almin, had been relieved from his duties effective immediately, expressing gratitude for the man’s efforts in service.
However, the consultancy failed to mention that the reason behind the decision is an increasingly hostile campaign waged against the man by a chorus of pro-government commentators and clerics who were angered by his suggestion in an interview with Sudan radio last week that the government might repeal Islamic Shari’ah laws if other political parties agreed to the move.
“If political parties agreed to repeal [Islamic] Shari’ah [law] then Shri3ah should go,” Hassab Allah reportedly said, triggering a sweeping wave of angry reactions despite his attempt to defend himself by saying that he was quoted out of context.
Lt-Gen Hassab Allah, a veteran intelligence officer who served in the security dockets since the Islamist government of President Al-Bashir seized power in a military coup in 1989, confirmed that he had received notification of his removal, saying he wishes the best of success for the rulers of the country.
Sources speaking to Sudan Tribune linked the sacking of Hassab Allah to a campaign orchestrated against him by Al-Tayyib Mustafa, the columnist and owner of the ultraconservative newspaper Al-Initbaha, and who is also the maternal uncle of Sudan’s President Al-Bashir.
Meanwhile, the committee of social affairs in the Sudanese parliament on Sunday summoned the sacked official and questioned him on the veracity of his statements.
The committee expressed reservation towards his statements and considered them as “controversial and strident,” saying it had received numerous objections to his statements.
