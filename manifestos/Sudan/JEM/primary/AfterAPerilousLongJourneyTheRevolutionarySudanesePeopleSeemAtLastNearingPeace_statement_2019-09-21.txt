After a Perilous Long Journey the Revolutionary Sudanese People Seem at Last Nearing Peace
By Mahmoud A. Suleiman
I thought it is necessary to report some cautionary remarks before delving into the subject matter for this article.The acceleration of events after the 19th of December 2018 has made it difficult to confirm what can happen in the Sudanese political arena, which is tense where some components of the political parties are restlessly running to reap the fruits of the revolution early before its maturity. Nevertheless,  anddespite all that there is great hope for the people  Sudanese in reaching at least to some of their aspirations if the political elites tried reflecting to the dire political situation prior to the Glorious December Revolution. The political Parties should feel some hardships which the majority of people of the Sudan still continue to suffersuch asthe scarcity of livingcommoditiesandthe prohibitively highprices and scarcity ofbasicgoods and the presence of remnants of the ousted regime, which work counter-revolution through the so-called deep state.Let alonethe series oftheatrical typetrialsofthe DeposedOmer al-Bashir’scrimesof Corruptionin isolation fromthe atrociousCrimes ofwar, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and  Genocidethatawaitinghisarrestwarrant,Issued since 2009and this recidivist criminalOmar al-Bashirwho remainsfugitive from international justice.
It is noteworthy that in announcing his New Government on 5 September 2019, Prime Minister Dr. Abdullah Hamdouk said, “We are starting a new phase in our history today, stressing that “the most important priorities of the Transitional Period is toStopthe war and Build Peace.” Peace has been at the forefront of 19thDecember 2018 PopularVictoriousRevolution which started Peaceful under theDistinctive logo andchantingSlogan:(Freedom,Peace andJustice) and theSudanese Revolutionaries, young and old, men and womendid notat any timerespondby using force duringthe oppression and repression that lasted for threeleandecades under the ruling regime of political Islamof the International Muslim Brotherhood Movement (MBM), the Khartoum branch,led by thefugitive from the International Justice and theGénocidaire, currently deposed and in custodyand being tried on corruption charges, Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashirin whose home millions of US dollars  have been foundStored in boxes.It is really ironic and a paradox where the Sudanese citizen Magdy Mohamed Ahmed Mahgoub was executed by hanging in December 1989 just6months after the National Islamic Front (NIF) MilitaryCoup d’état,for possessing an inheritanceMoney left by hislateFatheramounting to somethousands ofUS Dollars in the familySafe.https://www.alttahrer.com/archives/22961
And then joined Magdi the Sudanese co-pilot named Girgis al-Gus Boutros who was brought before the court. The charge was the sabotage to the national economy and violation of the Foreign Exchange Act.https://www.facebook.com/2069055120005718/posts/2343033285941232/
On his arrival to Juba, the Capital of South Sudan, on Thursday September 12, 2019,in his First Foreign Visit since his appointmentas a Prime Minister of Sudan, Dr. Abdalla Hamdok had a meeting with the South Sudan President Salva Kiir Mayardit.At the juncture, theNews media outlets indicated thatHamdok said upon his arrival: “I am very delighted to be here in mySecondHome, Juba. We are looking for a very strategic, very distinguished relationship between our two nations, and the sky is the limit for this relationship.”https://www.france24.com/en/20190912-sudan-pm-hamdok-arrives-in-juba-on-first-official-trip
On the other hand, and worth mentioning, that theSudan’sNewCivilianPrime Minister Abdalla Hamdok when he was sworn in on Wednesday as leader of aTransitionalGovernment, he vowed toachieve Two important tasks which aresustainablePeace and Solving the Country’s EconomicCrisis as his Government’s Priority.

Stopping the war and work to build a just, comprehensive and sustainable peace,hasbeen on the top of theTen Priorities of the Sudanese Transitional Civilian Government.https://www.france24.com/en/20190821-sudan-transition-joint-military-opposition-rule-omar-al-bashir
Unity of the various armed rebel groups in juba under the umbrella of Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF) is considered a greatleaptowards the achieving peace in Sudan.  Thus, the Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF) groups announced from the South Sudanese capital Juba on Tuesday the reunification of the two factions of the rebel umbrella and decided to hand over the organization’s leadership to the head of the Sudan Liberation Movement-Transitional Council Dr. Hadi Idriss Yahia.According to the SRF spokesman, Dr. Mohamed Zakaria Faragalla, the Juba meetings picked Hadi Idriss Yahia as a Chairman, Malik Agar as his Deputy and Gibril Ibrahim as Secretary-General.

In another Major Step,the Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF) has congratulated the Sudanese people onthejoiningofthe Sudan Liberation Forces (SPLA) led by Comrade Taher Hajar, one of the signatories to the Juba Declaration to build confidence and pave the way for peace.This positive step hasushered inLessthan two days after signing understandings with the Sudanese government to build confidence, a prelude to negotiations.This unification will of the Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF) factions will move Sudan towards a just sustainable peace and building a citizenship state without discrimination, as rightly indicated comradeYasir Arman theDeputy leader of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North(SLM-N).
On the same important issue of peace, the Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF) said that it highly values the unity of the politicalopposition workand affirms that to the Sudanese political forces that its doors are open for them all to join to its matrixIn support of peace, stability and good governance.
The Sudanese Prime Minister Dr. Abdalla Hamdokmetwith the leaders of thearmed movements –aka-Movements ofArmedStruggle(MAS)in Juba on Thursday eveningin the presence oftheSouthSudanese officials,whenhe discussed the efforts of theTransitionalAuthorityandhisnewly appointed Cabinetandthe Sovereign Council to bringabout Comprehensive Sustainable Peace toall parts ofSudan and create an environment conducive for a democratic transition.TheUnity ofthe SudaneseArmed Struggle Movements in the South Sudan CapitalJuba hasbeenan advanced step to work hard to advancethe sustainable peacedemands, which include the final cessation of war, the release of prisoners of war, the search for the whereabouts of missing persons during war and the fulfillment of the rights of internally displaced persons and refugees, including their return to their homes. And their lands occupied by the groups brought by the deposed regime gang from the neighboring African countries during the absurd wars imposed on the inhabitants of Darfur, South Kordofan and Southern Blue Nile, while providing the necessary liabilities to these citizens and compensating them.
We need to reflect on the fact that the previous meetings held in Addis Ababa, Cairo and Juba went on to complete the slogans of the revolution by placing the issue of peace at the top of the political agenda, and the Juba Declaration and its issues are an important breakthrough in the peace process.Furthermore, the Sudanese people valued the good spirit that prevailed in the meetings of the Sudanese Revolutionary Front in all its components with the delegation of the Sovereignty Council headed by General Mohamed Hamdan Dugulu Hemedti, and the meeting with the Prime Minister Dr. Abdullah Hamdouk and affirms its commitment to all agreed on peace as one of the top priorities of the victorious Sudanese Revolution December.
Moreover,Ababa, Cairo and Juba went on to complete the slogans of the revolution by placing the issue of peace at the top of the political agenda, and the Juba Declaration and its issues are an important breakthrough in the peace process.
Nevertheless, onestage of theDecember 19th2018Revolution, thearmed strugglecomponents felt they have been let down by the Forces for the Declarationof Freedom and Change as though there was something hidden in the corridors that did not look right in the form of “Anti-Sudanese Revolutionary Front (RSF)andagainstSustainable Peace. However,there was success ofthe meetings at the South Sudan Capital Juba where unificationof the rebel movements took place under the support of the PresidentSalva Kiir Mayardit.
The Sudanese people valued the good spirit that prevailed in the meetings of the Sudanese Revolutionary Front in all its components with the delegation of the Sovereignty Council headed by General Mohamed Hamdan DogoloHamidti, and the meeting with the Prime Minister Dr. Abdullah Hamdouk and affirms its commitment to all agreed on peace as one of the top priorities of the victorious Sudanese Revolution December
In this context, the Sudanese people in the war zones should finally appreciate and welcometherecentgoodwilland sincere endeavorsto coordinatebetween the two parties of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM)-North,of Agar, andthat ofAbdel-Aziz Al-Helu faction in order to reach an honorable agreement for the people of the two regions in the Nuba Mountains andthe Blue NileIngassanaand Sudan in general and address the roots causes of absurd warfor reachinga fair, comprehensive and urgentpeace that addresses the outstanding issues caused by the absurd warsover the past decades.
It is noteworthy to scrutinize the contents of the report Khartoum by JadaL-Rab Ebeid and Osman El – Taher that the Member of the Sovereign Council, Mohamed Hassan Al-Ta’ayshi, revealed new details about their negotiations with the Armed Movements in South Sudan capital Juba, and confirmed that they agreed to make great concessions to achieve peace that addresses the roots of war in the country. At a symposium organized by the Association of Darfur Media and Journalists entitled Peace in the Friendship Hall yesterday, we completed the file of opening humanitarian aid tracks in one session, at a time when the previous regime was unable to agree on them in 16 rounds, stressing their firm conviction to reach peace. Furthermore, Mohammed HassanAl-Ta’ayshi revealed the sovereign request of the South Sudan leader Dr. Riek Machar to go with them to South Sudan, although he is under house arrest in Khartoum by theIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), and he continued saying: (We determined to Achieve Peace between Dr. Riek Machar and President Salva Kiir and he reiterated his firmnessto move towards that vital destinationthatguarantees Peaceforthe SouthSudan whichisno doubt Peace forSudan).

This is in accordance with the principles for which the Sudanese people have risenup, namelyfor Freedom,Peace,Justice and the establishment of an exonerated experience from all the shortcomings of the past. The chairs are onlyforcompetencies that advance the country to the dreams of its youth and notoffered as jobs based onQuotasas if they weretheprivatizationjobs that have affected SudanDisastrouslyfor threeleandecades.
One finds himself fully convinced that the chants of theRevolutionarySudanese masses during the sit-in in front of the General Command of the Sudanese armyin the Capital Khartoumwere sincere chantsthe echoed andsaying:”All theCountryisDarfur)!Taking all that into consideration, one remains very much convinced that the people who suffered theravages of the war of attrition in Darfur, the Nuba Mountains, southern Blue Nile, and Ingassana, the people of eastern Sudan in Kassala, Port Sudan, the Nubians in northern Sudan, and the People in the irrigated Al Gezeera project in the Central region will receive their rights as Sudanese citizens.
One finds himself fully convinced that the chants of the Sudanese masses during the sit-in in front of the General Command of the Sudanese army were sincere chants saying all the countryisDarfur– All of Us are Darfur, being the Chant.
In this revolutionary atmosphere, we as Sudanese should be organized under the banner of one Sudanese homeland without suspicion and the epidemic of feelingofbetrayed. Nowthat the long-time Dictator Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashirisincustody in Kober Prison, he is being tried for crimes of possession of millions of dollars at his home. He is also awaiting the International Criminal Court(ICC)in The Hague, the Netherlandsfor the crimes he has perpetrated against the Sudanese civilian citizens in the region of Darfur, and his corruptentourage isas well awaiting similarfateas there isnochance for impunity and scape fromaccountability.
The currently ousted regime of the political Islam aka International Muslim Brotherhood Movement (MBM), the Khartoum branch spent Thirty failed odd lean years in power without making any tangible efforts to make Sudan an economic power house. Instead, it made Sudan a country that runs from one evil axis to another during its begging quest. The saddening outcome has been misery, Poverty, absurd wars waged against civilian citizen populations in the hinterlands of the country. Heinous crimes have been perpetrated by the order of the Génocidaire, Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir using his ruthless paramilitary recruits, better known as Popular Defence Forces (PDF), the Janjaweed nomadic tribal Militias along with Mercenaries from the Neighbouring African counties. This crisis forced the survivors of that Holocaust to flee their land and homes either into makeshift dwellings for the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) or crossing the boarders seeking refuge in a nearby Country mainly Chad, Central African Republic (CAR) while the surviving Youth went on a trek across the Mediterranean Sea becoming prey for the Human Traffickers or drowning when the dilapidated Rubber Boats Cap-sight. The Survivors would seek a European (EU) Nation to hopefully becoming refugees aka Asylum seekers.
There is no end to the daily events of the December 2018 Sudanese Revolution. One would say that was destroyed by the demolition pick during 30 lean years is not easy to repair in a short period estimated as ten months since the outbreak of the Glorious Revolution of the people of Sudan.
We, the people of Sudan, should mention some of the achievements of the glorious December 2018 revolution.We must point out the formation of theSovereign Counciland the Councilof Ministers, the formation of the Peace Commission.The parties in Sudan havealsoagreed to “resume peace negotiations in mid-October2019inthe South Sudan CapitalJuba and reach a comprehensive agreement by December.Andlet us point tothe arrest of the symbols of the deposed regime of the National Islamic Congress Party (NCP)the GénocidaireOmer Hassan Ahmed Al-Bashir and his prosecution for the crime of financial corruption, andhe is still detained in Kober prison. The rest will come straight and the Sudanese Prime Minister Dr. Abdullah Hamdouk will attend the meetings of the United Nations Organization in New York as the representative of Sudan andwillpresent Sudan’s speech for the first time in 30 years.And the restof the aspirationswill come straight, God Willing.So Letus continueour quest tomarch to achieve longings with someslow downingandkeepingaltruisticpositionandrespectfor the rights ofourothercompatriots.
