U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATEOffice of the SpokespersonFor Immediate Release
December 11, 2012, 2012/1961Ambassador Princeton Lyman, U.S. Special Envoy to Sudan and South Sudan, travels to Juba, South Sudan today for a series of high-level meetings with government officials, members of civil society, and representatives of international organizations working in South Sudan.
Ambassador Lyman’s visit comes at a critical time in the delayed implementation of the historic agreements between Sudan and South Sudan signed on September 27.  The Sudanese and South Sudanese people deserve swift and complete implementation of these agreements, as called for by the AU Peace and Security Council in its October 24 communiqué.
Special Envoy Lyman will engage South Sudan on the resolution of outstanding issues, such as the disputed area of Abyei, and the implementation of the crucial agreements, including the creation of the safe demilitarized border zone and the resumption of oil production between the two countries.  Special Envoy Lyman will also underscore the United States’ commitment to supporting South Sudan’s economic development and growth as a full-fledged democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law.
Following his visit to South Sudan, Special Envoy Lyman will proceed to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to attend the meeting of the Joint Political and Security Mechanism being convened by the African Union High-Level Implementation Panel Chairman Thabo Mbeki.
The White House recently announced that Ambassador Lyman will step down in the new year as U.S. Special Envoy to Sudan and South Sudan after two years of service, notably marked by helping to shepherd the creation of an independent South Sudan.  Special Envoy Lyman will serve in his position until the President names a new envoy.
