I’m glad to be with you here today in Geneva. Yes, we came to this place from different countries and continents but we share a single common goal, which is safeguarding human rights across the globe.Ladies and gentlemen, at first, let me thank, on your behalf, the organizers of the Geneva Summit for Democracy and Human Rights and their relentless efforts and campaign for human rights.In the name of humanity , I appeal directly from this hall to you, the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court and everyone who is concerned with what is going on in Sudan to put pressure on the Sudanese government to stop the ongoing killing of innocent civilians in Darfur and the two regions of Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile. I call on you to also pressure the Sudanese government to stop the expulsion of international organizations who provide aid to the internally displaced people in their camps and allow the flow of aid to reach the affected civilians.Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to press the government of Sudan to immediately stop the racially motivated policy of killing and arresting of Darfuri students at universities across Sudan. It is a high time for the government of the National Congress Party in Khartoum to end its crackdown on political activists, oppression of women and all forms of violations of human rights and crimes against humanity.I would like to draw your attention to the ugliness of the suffering of the Sudanese people from the countless crimes that continue to be perpetrated by the state security agents, the police, the army and other paramilitary groups with absolute impunity. We all know that the Sudanese President Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmad Al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague since March 2009 for his role in the crimes committed in Darfur, but he has not been arrested so far to face these charges. President Al-Bashir’s grip on power and his ability to escape justice at the Hague, only means more killings and suffering of the Sudanese people, as well as threat to peace with neighboring countries.Ladies and gentlemen, the simple fact is this: the restoration of human rights and democracy in Sudan will not take place before the arrest of President Omar al-Bashir. For this fundamental reason, I strongly appeal to you to request the United Nations to implement the Article VI of its charter to arrest suspects of war crimes who wanted by International Justice, on top of then President Al-Bashir and his aides from the ruling party. Justice is the only tool for the victims who lost their loved ones, properties and suffered from the most horrendous crimes to restore their human dignity.I hope my appeal would receive your kind consideration.Thank youmohamed nour aoudouGeneva19/02/2013
