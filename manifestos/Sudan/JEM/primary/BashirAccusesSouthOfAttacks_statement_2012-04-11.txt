Airlines cancel S. Sudan flights after deadline
(AFP) Airlines cancelled flights from Sudan to the newly independent South on Monday, travelers said, after new rules treating the route as international took effect.  The ending of domestic services to South Sudan came the day after a deadline for an estimated half a million ethnic Southerners to return South or formalize their status in the north.  Abdelhafiz Abdelrahim, spokesman for the Sudan Aviation Authority, told AFP that beginning on Monday airlines operating to South Sudan had to comply with international procedures.  Carriers serving Juba and other points in South Sudan would move from Khartoum’s domestic terminal to the international one, Abdelrahim added.  The April 8 time limit ended a grace period after South Sudan separated last July in the wake of an overwhelming “yes” vote in an independence referendum that followed Africa’s longest civil war.

Umma Party Sec Gen voted out of office
(Sudan Tribune)  The Secretary General of the National Umma Party (NUP) Sideeg Ismail conceded defeat at a vote that took place over the weekend during a meeting of the partyâ€™s Central Commission (NUPCC).  Under the NUPâ€™s rules and the procedures, the Sec Gen would deliver a report before the NUPCC outlining accomplishments during his term in office as well as any other issues that need to be raised.  The report is then subjected to a vote and should a majority stand against it then the Sec Gen, as a matter of tradition, is expected to hand down his resignation or in the alternative a confidence vote would take place.  According to official results announced by the NUP, 284 voted against the report with 252 in favor and five votes considered faulty. More than 300 NUPCC members were not in attendance.  The controversial Sec Gen was widely expected to lose his seat amid accusations by many in the party of him having strong links to the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) led by president Omer Hassan al-Bashir.  NUP leader al-Mahdi hailed Ismailâ€™s term though he acknowledged some mistakes on his part but justified it as part of “human effort”.  Ismail was replaced by Ibrahim al-Amin who is considered to be an agreeable figure by most NUP members. Ironically, al-Amin was one of the main contenders against Ismail in the 2009 elections for SG.
South Sudanese stranded in Khartoum in legal row
(Reuters) Scared and confused, hundreds of South Sudanese were stranded at Khartoum airport on Monday after being denied permission to board their flights to the south in a dispute over their legal status.  The unclear legal status for South Sudanese in the north is one of many unresolved issues between the former foes since the South gained independence in July under a peace agreement.  Khartoum has ruled out dual citizenship for more than 500,000 southerners who have lived in the north for decades and started treating of them as foreigners on Monday after the end of a grace period.  Until Sunday flights to the southern capital Juba had been conducted at the domestic terminal without passport controls.  But many are now stuck in limbo, since South Sudan has failed to open an embassy in Khartoum that can issue passports.  At the airport, hundreds of South Sudanese tried checking into their flights to Juba early on Monday but immigration officials denied them entry.  With almost no passengers to check in, state-owned Sudan Airways and other local carriers suspended their Juba flights.  Around 500 South Sudanese queued outside the embassy building but were unable to get passports or temporary travel documents since it is not yet fully functional. Khartoum has ruled out dual citizenship.Al-Arabi Intends to Visit Darfur
