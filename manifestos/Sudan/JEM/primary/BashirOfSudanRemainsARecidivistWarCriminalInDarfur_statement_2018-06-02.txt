Bashir of Sudan Remains a Recidivist War Criminal in Darfur
By Mahmoud A. Suleiman
Recidivism according to Wikipediathe free encyclopedia is the act of a person repeating an undesirable behaviour after they have either experienced negative consequences of that behaviour, or have been trained to extinguish that behaviour.Recidivist is the individualrepeating an undesirable behaviour as al-Bashir is doing.
Omer al-Bashir decided to re-commit his heinous crimes against the Sudanese people in Darfur.His games of peace with the people of Sudan in Darfur had been characterized by the endless back – and forth and backward renege of covenants to re-ignite the absurd proxy wars for the survival of Omer al-Bashir away from the most dreaded grip of the International Criminal Court.
Thus, under this al-Bashir andtheformerrule of the National Islamic Front(NIF), Sudan was ranked the seventh most failed country in the world,the fifthmostcorrupt country in the worldand at the bottom of the list of countries that do not apply the purposes of Islam.
The wise people in the countryside askBashirwith sorrow and pity for what the country has reachedat ofsad deteriorationas towhy not leavepowervoluntarily instead ofwaiting forforced removal?This is if there isstill remaining a glimmer of dignity, Omer al-Bashir has to give up Sudan’s rule voluntarily to show some courage andcredibility to his political life, which has been plagued by failures and crimes, has made him a pariah. Though this proposal may seem ideal, but in fact it is a timely proposal. Despite the delay, the question directed to Omar al-Bashir is: Why do not you leave with some of your dignity instead of being forcefully removedwithout yourwillin humiliation. That fate is seen far away, but it is likely to happenif you read modern history thoroughly.
With regard to the UNAMID in Darfur, the people there say the following:What is required in Darfur is not to withdraw or to reduce the strength of UNAMID, but rather to keep it stronger and give it more authority – Mandate- to carry out the tasks of protecting the citizens and deterring the militias of the regime from harming the citizens in the region. This statement has come from the Testimonies made by Sudanese People from all the Five Federal States in the Darfur region.The people in Darfur considerUNAMID’s presence was and is still regarded as a deterrent, and persons from the villages that live nearby still seek their help when they know an attack by the Janjaweed (Rapid Support Force) or other government militia is imminent. They go to where UNAMID is residing and stay there until they feel it is safe to manoeuvre.

The crimes and misdeeds committed by the International Muslim Brotherhood Movement (IMBM) Khartoum branch, sometimes referred to as political Islam against the people in Sudan, cannot be counted due to their large numbers on one hand and on the other hand to the terrible damage they tended to cause to human beings, animals and land, as well as its subsequent effects in the years after.
According to statistics of crimes documented during theTwenty Nine leanyears of the rule of the Islamicsyndicateentity, the so-calledPolitical Islam in Sudan led by genocidal criminal Marshal Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, in nearly three decades, characterized byuncountable crimes but the main ones includedthe crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide in Darfur, the division of the country to the north and south on racial basis, which made the Sudanese people in the southern region choose to secede and establish their own state  of South Sudan.This isin addition to thePermission and codifying of corruptionwhich took to the level of epidemic in all Government Institutions. Moreover, the regime hassponsoredterrorism and its export to the neighboring countries of Africa and around the worldand continued harbouring different factions of terrorists.The regime has tirelessly worked under the divide to rule doctrine that resulted intothe fragmentation of the fabric of Sudanese societies. Furthermore, al-Bashir andhis entourage worked tirelessly armed with the tool of corruptiontowardsthe destruction of state productive institutions,such astheGeziraIrrigated AgriculturalProject along withthe sale ofSudan’s maritime fleet, known asSudanLine, whichwas sold to foreigners. The foregoing is just the tip of the iceberg. The systematic institutional corruption along with mismanagement and assignment of unqualified, incapableand inexperienced people to the leadership responsibility of production and financial institutions through nepotism led the country to the brink of bankruptcy. As a consequence of thathas been the recentbankruptcy of the Central Bank of the stocks and economic collapse that led to a catastrophic situation in the daily life of the citizens of Sudan throughout the country, including the capital Khartoum where it is difficult to get a loaf of bread at a reasonable priceespecially duringthe scarcity of fuel, which negativelyleading tothe difficulty of obtaining drinking water in the regions of Darfur and Kordofan.The Pastoral areas witnessedthe death of livestock from the lack of drinking waterlet alonewater for irrigated projects.The crimes committed by the Khartoum Political Islam regime against the Sudanese citizens in the Darfur region since the outbreak of the revolution in 2003 and according to UN figures that suggestedapproximately 3 million people remain displaced from their homes, as refugees in eastern Chadandwell over 500,000 people have been killed directly or indirectly by the violenceimposed byKhartoumand along withtens of thousands of girls and women have been raped as sexual violence continues to be deployed as a brutal weapon of war.http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article62255
This article comes against the backdrop of thenewwave ofviolenceand the freshly committedheinouswar Crimes Perpetrated in Darfur by the government-backed tribal militias known as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of theformernotorious Janjaweed militias who committed thecrimes against humanity, war crimes and Genocide inDarfur,in the beginning of the crisis,under the orders of Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir,thefugitive from international justice and chased by the International Criminal Court (ICC)atThe Haguein the Netherlandsand a pariah of the peoples of the civilized world.
The Janjaweed Tribal Militias are wreaking havoconlarge swaths ofDarfur.
The past few weeks have seen a dramatic deterioration in the security situation in large parts oftheDarfurregion, especiallyin theJebel Marraarea wheresomeInternally DisplacedPersons (IDPs)camps, includingthe Khamsa Dagayig (translatedfive-minute)camp in Zalingei and the Aradeiba camp in Garsila, as well as repeated attempts by the governmentof Sudanto remove and evacuate theKalma camp for theInternally Displacedpersons (IDPs) in Nyala using force.
Among the serious and ongoing developments in the Jebel Marra area is aerial bombardment using military aircraft targeting villages and populated areas, which forced tens of thousands of unarmedcivilian Sudanesecitizens to flee again under extremely harsh humanitarian conditions.
The region is also witnessing the return of armed militias supported by the government, which has continued its criminal activities of burning villages, looting property, killing dozens of defenseless citizens, committing rapeas a war weaponand various violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.
On May 30, 2018, the militias affiliated with the NCP government attacked the Mount Arai farms in KrainikLocally, West Darfur. The attack injured four internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Krainik camp. This attack coincided with the regime’s attempts to dismantle the displaced camps since the announcement of the operations of this so-called arms collection, as already announced by the South Darfur Governor Adam Al-Faki. The authorities arrested seven leaders of theKalmadisplaced Camp andamongthe detaineesis theCoordinator Generalof the CampYagoubFrey.
The disenfranchised Sudanese people in the Darfur region of Sudan have already suffered the woes of the proxy wars waged by Omer al-Bashir using the Janjaweed militias when the rebels took up armsandwhen the then the National Islamic Front (NIF) declared that it would only negotiate with those carry arms as it came to power through the barrel of the gun but today the people in Darfur  are facing “another very challenging year” when it comes to those dwelling in the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) who have been threatened by ultimatum of being driven out of their Camps which are planned to be dismantled and the residents would face grim and uncertain future without anybody helping and protecting them.
The Khamsa Dagayig (five-minute)camp in Zalingei and theAradeibacamp inGarsilahavewitnessed attacks by government-backed militias that killed and wounded dozens of residents of the two camps. Several attempts have been made by South Darfur state authorities to vacate the Kalma camp to displacethealreadydisplaced people andrepeatthe protracted humanitarian disaster in Darfur Since 2003.
On the other hand, theinfamous Ingaz–meaningrescue– referring to the National Islamic Front (NIF) regimecontinues its policy of systematic targeting against Darfur studentsin higher education institutions and universities as happened in the Bakhtalruda Universityand targeting Darfuri activists in all areas. Some of them are still being held on arbitrary charges including charges of cooperating with armed movements.
These grave developments come inthe lightof the recentUnited NationsSecurity Council(UNSC) Resolutions concerning the reduction of UNAMID without providing an appropriate alternative to the responsibility to protect the lives and property of the people of Darfur in accordance with the resolutions of the Council under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.
The Sudaneseopposition parties, in particular, the SudaneseCommunist Party(SCP)warned andpointedtotheadverse consequencesof this decision, which ignoresthe nature of the deteriorating security situation originally. The party said in a statement issued at the end of last year that the reduction of UNAMID forces will create a securitygap anda widevacuum leadingto the renewed violations throughout the region and theNational Congress Party (NCP) regimethat waswaiting for UNAMID to leave thefield forTribal militias to restore theirformercriminal activities.
The occurrence of these violations is accompanied by the absence of rule of law in the region and the widespread phenomenon of impunity andlack ofaccountability in light of the inability of the judicialinstitutions responsible for the implementation of justice because of the existence of extensive immunities and the continuation of theArbitraryEmergency lawimposed on the regionsince 1989.
The Sudanese Communist Party calls on the UN Security Council(UNSC)to take urgent measures to protect the lives and property of the people of Darfur, based on the resolutions adopted by the Council on the situation in Darfur under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. It also calls on the African Peace and Security Council to play its role in protecting the lives of Darfurians,totake measures to ensure justice and bring those involved in such violations to the courtsto face the predicaments of their crimes.
The Sudanese Communist Party appeals to the people of Darfur to take decisive action to counter the policies of theNational Congress Party (NCP) regime, which aims to fragment the unity of the region and impose the phenomenon of ethnic cleansing by burning villages, evacuating camps, preventing the return of displaced persons to their villages of origin and eventually appropriating the land and its resourcestothosemercenaries brought by the regimefromtheoutside and within the country.
The Sudanese Communist Party demands all the Sudanese people to show solidarity with the people of Darfur in these harshtimes and grave conditions, considering that the Darfur problem is an integral part of the comprehensive national crisis.
This appeal is addressed to theSudanesePoliticalOppositionfactionstoUnite and donot try tohelpliftingthe sunken shipof (NCP) regime led bythe genocidal criminal Omer al-Bashir.Furthermore, you shouldn’t tryto raise the wreck ofthe Pirate ship from the sea bed, let it befood for the hungry whale and otherstarvingsea creatures!Try to agree on the minimum if it deems necessary.The NIF/NCP regime has taken the advantage of the Dividedand Differing Opposition Components in order to extend its presence on the helm andRuling of Sudan without a competitor for so long.We must not grant the ruling regime of the National Congress Party (NCP) a New lifeline where we have given it enough over  the past lean three decades which it took it advantage for the oppressing the people of Sudan and to perpetrate more crimes of genocide.
While the NCP regime is committing further crimes against the Sudanese people in Darfur, the news media reported quoting the United States Chargé d’Affaires in Khartoum, Steven Koutsis, has expressed his country’s readiness to continue the dialogue with Sudan. Furthermore, Steven Koutsis,the U.S. envoy expressed his hope for the normalization talk’s which move to the second phase which involves removal of Sudan’s name from the terror list..
On Sunday the 27thMay 2018, Sudan’s State Foreign Minister Mohamed Abdallah Idrishas been quoted as sayingthat the NCP regime hasembarked on making arrangements to launch the second phase of dialogue with the U.S. according to the five-track engagement plan.

These actions of the Sudanese government do not warrant any sanctions relief given the clear evidence of Omer al-Bashir’s failuretoabide by the requirements of theUS President’sExecutive Order 13761.The US sanction relief has begun empowering a genocidal regime with additional capacity to acquire more military equipment, train more soldiers and militias to commit more war crimes in Darfur and elsewhere in Sudan.Three of the five tracks of Sudan’s commitment to a cessation of hostilities, unimpeded humanitarian access to regions under siege by the Sudan Armed Forces, and cooperation on counterterrorism remain unmetin an explicit and complete violation of the US executive order.
The so-called Five-trackengagement process between the US administration and Omer al-Bashir has been an abject failure in taming thegenocidal regime whichreturned to its old bad and evil habits ofkilling, rape, displacement andappropriation of propertiesof thelong-suffering people of Sudanthroughout the troubled Darfur region.
There has been substantial renewed fighting in Darfur in the past two weeks, as referred to above. There is evidence of targeting of civilians by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and their affiliated Rapid Support (RSF) militias and, as expected, no humanitarian access has been granted to South Kordofan and Blue Nile states where atrocities continued to be committed and only limited access to Darfur.
New reports have surfaced indicating that the US Administration has recently called on the regime in Sudan to adopt new approach to achieve peace in Darfur. The Sudan Tribune Cyber journal ofMay 30, 2018 reported thatthe United States Chargé d’Affaires in Khartoum, Steven Koutsis has called on the Sudanese government to adopt new mechanisms to achieve sustainable peace in Darfur.http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article65527
The US Chargé d’Affaires Koutsis who was visiting North Darfur State demanded the government to continue the disarmament campaign and meet the holdout groups in order to join the peace process.
Here, the American politician seems to have forgotten or trying to discard the cunning tricks of the NCP ruling regimeled by al-Bashir, is not expected to reach a just and sustainable peace with the parties in Darfur. History has repeatedly proved that Omer al-Bashir will not respond to peace forhisfear of being overthrown and ofbeinghanded over tothe International Criminal Court(ICC)which he fears a lot and remains obsessed with and a nightmare. The US Chargé d’affaires should have visited the Central Darfur statein which Sudanese civilians have been attacked and killed by the government forces and the allied militias of the Rapid Support Force (RSF) and resulting in thousands of villagers to flee into the middle of nowhere including the IDPs Caps in the State.Perhaps, whathasthe newGovernor ofCentral DarfurState, Mohamed Ahmed Gad al-Sayyid, makes him one of the heroes of the provocative statements that theaffiliates of theso-called National Salvation Revolution have called for sincetheir ill-fated arrival.He reiterated the boring statement threatening theforcedevacuation ofthe IDPcamps and the provision of security and stability throughoutas hismandatewhichareobviously thehighest prioritiesof his Government.
By any all measures, the existence of Omer al-Bashir and his ruling regime in Sudan is a stumbling block to the survival of Sudan as a unified state after the secession of the south, besides the instability and along with Sudan being at the tail of the world’s countries in all fields of progress but at the summit of failed countries around the world in all areas of modern life. Furthermore, the continuation of futile wars will be continued unabatedly to protect thegenocidalcriminal from the grip of the International Criminal Court(ICC).Therefore,there is no magic wand to reform the situation in Sudan in the presence of Omer al-Bashir and his corrupt criminal entourage in the rule of Sudan andtheonly optiontoresolvethechronic fatefulproblems of Sudan,is thegettingrid of the ruling regime of the National Congress Party(NCP) anditsdemiseby all availablemeansto the people of Sudan.
As for the opinion of the Sudanese people regarding the so-called 2020 elections, they are meant to extend the arbitrary rule of Omer al-Bashir as well as the distraction the people of Sudan away from the issues that concern them. The so-called elections in 2020 are nothing but allow al-Bashir competing alone and earns the votes alone by fraud, as happened in the past!Counterfeiting is the master of the situation in the elections of the ruling regime of the National Congress Party (NCP).Therefore,2020 electionsmean anything to the Sudaneseindividual who suffersfrom his daily livelihood and eager to get drinking water and a loaf of bread for himself and his familywho isliving under the poverty line.And the provision of health and education services and drinking water and improvement of the daily living for the citizen has become irrelevant to the ruling regime and thus became null and void because the(NCP) regime hasresorted to the privatization of public servicesand privatised tothe beneficiaries of hisfatcats andthecorrupt parasitic capitalists.
In the midst of this dilemma, we say that it is enough to groan and complainwhich wouldnotleadusto anything concretethatchanges the situation of the Sudanesepeople, given the fact thatthe rope of patience on the sufferinghasendedand we are left with onlyone option which isthe uprising and the declaration of the greatpopular long-awaited Revolution to overthrow the corrupt criminal regime. Thus, wedo not expect the help of anyone but ourselves.The only option left for the Sudanese people to escape from all of the foregoing entanglements isOur collective actionbacked by sincerityas the people of Sudanand withthe Bless ofGod Almighty and we will be victorious.
