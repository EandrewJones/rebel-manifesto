Bashir should respondto the will of Sudanese people or the deluge
By Mahmoud A. Suleiman
The will of the peopleis usuallyabove the oppressive toolofthetyrants as is known throughout the history of mankind, but the tyrants likeOmeral-Bashirof Sudando not take the lessons of their failure to understand their peoples and their sick intransigence in the face of theevidence that guides them to understandthe eternal truthsand taking lessons.
This article comes, as its predecessor, against the backdrop of theoutbreakof theThirdSudanese Glorious RevolutionofWednesdayDecember the 19th2018during which the Cities, Towns and Villages in all over Sudan rose up with one objective ofthe overthrow of the arbitrary ruling regime of Omer al-Bashir.As the popular demonstrations continued for the third month in a rowas of today 23rdMarch 2019, chanted “Freedom, Peace and Justice”andRevolutionistheChoice of thepeople”andtheyset outforthe Populardemonstrationswhichhave continued and dozens of processions have beencontinuing on the 23rdof Marchin several areas of theThree Town Capital Khartoumafter theFriday prayers, as a gathering of professionalshasputforwardanewmap of its movements next week, including the identification ofbusinessinstitutionsaffiliated to the National Congress Party (NCP) regime affiliates andcalled for targeting them witheconomic boycott as a popular tool to derail the sources of wealth of the regime’s corrupt entourage.
The recent Austerity measuresimposedby al-Bashir and his criminalentourageto Sudan in addition to countless other heinous crimes,includingtheprison sentencesimposedfor those arrested during the public peaceful demonstrationshave ignited the popular uprising.
Of the noticeable corrupt features of the NCP regime inadditiontothepomposity, arrogance andinept incompetent personalityofOmeral-Bashirwholacks the basic wisdomof a statesmanthat mighthavehelpedSudan coming out of the mayhem and havoc which led the country during the three lean decadesof his arbitrary ruleto chronic crises, reinforced the outbreak of the continuing uprising.Unfortunately, that was the fate of the resilient Sudanese people.  Furthermore, there isno intentionamong the people of Sudan to siding with his inept National Congress Party (NCP) regimewhich is  overshadowed by the length of time and the chronic failure associated with the crimes of financial corruption, extrajudicial  killing and crimes of war and genocide of unarmed Sudanese  civilian citizens, which forced them to be displaced from their homes and to migrate to the overseas for an unknown future, becoming prey to  the sea whales and other predators, including sea pirates and human trafficking mafia.
Some optimistic people expect that the pompous Omer al-Bashir would opt to sobriety from his arrogance to give in to the Sudanese public will. However, that dream is unlikely tohappen given the fact that the dictator Bashir is no longer in control of his own regimegovernmentelements which are currently divided along the lines of quotas. It isnoteworthy thatsome of the constituent elements of his party and his government have sided with the will of the revolution of the Sudanese people, which affected all the regions of Sudan and the demonstrations continued unabatedly since 19 December 2018demanding that Omer al-Bashir and his regime should step down to allow the people to choose the nature of the government they want. Furthermore, to get out of the predicament introduced by Al-Bashir and his lengthy period that wasted the livelihood  of the Sudanese people and their country along with the systematic destruction of infrastructure and selling the sources of production through corruption and luting public money into foreign banks abroad.
The brutality of the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) is indescribable and unimaginable as well. That is because there is no cruelty beyond genocide.
The tipping point for the uprising has been thought asa response tothe rise in bread and fuel prices in Sudan, but as a Matter of fact, the underlying causes is beyond that. It relates to the iron fist Daredevil repressive policies of the 30 year long military dictatorship imposed on the people ofSudanresulting into secession of one third of its populationof Sudan of the citizens in the South Sudandue to racial hatred andof course the genocidalcrimesal-Bashir perpetratedagainst the Sudanesepeoplein the region of Darfur in the westernSudan.The crimes of the regime chaired by Omer al-Bashir hit large segments of the people of Sudan; includingthose who were martyred inside the prison and detention cells as well as those killed in Darfur, the Nuba Mountains, the Blue Nile region and the victims of PortSudan,and those who were killed in cold blood in the Amri and Kajbar areas in Northern Sudan region and the martyrs of the revolution of September 2013 when more than 200 young men and women were massacred in cold blood.Furthermore,we would not forget the28 Sudanese military officers who were executed on April 28 –1990in Ramadan, the Placeof theirgraves is still undisclosed by the regime to their loved ones.
During The heinous crime that led to the execution of those twenty eight military officers in Ramadan, General Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, as commander-in-chief and commander in chief of the armed forces, is responsible for achieving justice and abiding by military law and regulations in all cases of the armed forces. And this is what happened during the stages of the investigation procedures with the officers of the “April movement” and even the execution of the death sentences, and oddity that the commander of the armed forces to escape to the hiding place to hide in the home of a member of the Islamic Front in the Eastern Blue Nile Region and Leaving all his leadership responsibilities to be run by junior officers, and only returned the next day after the failure of the coup attempt!!.https://www.facebook.com/SUDAN4ALL/posts/%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%B6%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%A1%D9%A9%D9%A9%D9%A0%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%87-%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%8A%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B5-%D8%A8%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%BAbakrielsaieghyahoode/708191455922260/
At this time, as they say that at this time that the ruling National Congress Party in the Sudan led by Omer al-Bashir staggeringwhile thehorizonfor solutionsto Sudan’s crises have become blocked and thePrimeMinister of the Bashir government says thathe isnot the reason for the demonstrations and as each of them puts the blame on the other. While each of them puts the blame on the other when the land has narrowed despite its wide capacity as a result of the evils they have committed against the humble and tolerant Sudanese people who rose up when ager reached the climax and the point of noreturnbut the ousting of the regime.
It is ironic that Omer al-Bashir has formed a new government to replace the place of his former government under the name of the government of competencies, although it has the same faces that formerly the Sudanese people called it the government of the corrupts and adding a group of military officers and security personnel as rulers in the 18 states of Sudan.As it is known but It is worth mentioning thatthe forces of the Declaration of Freedom andChangewhich is the umbrella of a political body chosen by the components of the Sudanese opposition forces, groups called for Omer al-Bashir to resign and form technocrat government with acollegial presidential council to lead the country during a four- year period to end armed conflicts, resolve the economic crisis and prepare for general election.  Thus, the unified Sudanese opposition has an unwavering position which explicitly expressed that initiative led by a government-allied coalition, 2020 Forces, to find a way out of the country’s current political crisis following protests to oust President Omer al-Bashirtofind approval is considered as the” SeventhImpossible orsuch aslike plowing in the sea, so to speak.
The Glorious December 19th2018 Popular Revolution which has so far  entered the  fourth month, nationwide protests calling for regime change are continuing in defiance of the national state of emergency declared by the president on 22 February2019.
As theDemonstrations continued to demand the departure of theregime for the ninety-third day, as of the 22ndof March 2019in a row in several neighborhoodsafter theFriday prayers, there is no retreat for a compromise for allowing al-Bashir to continue on the “throne” until the so-called 2020 “electioneering”!The masses ofthesteadfastSudanesepeopleled by theLed by theGathering of SudaneseProfessionals and theForces of the Declaration of Freedom and Changehave determined to soldier on until the hateful regime listens to the loud public voice or wait its inevitabledemise.
Furthermore,The Sudan Call alliance(SC)of opposition parties and armed movements has confirmed its withdrawal from all dialogue initiatives offered by the Sudanese government, as well as the Roadmap brokered by the African Union High-level Implementation Panel (AUHIP).The announcement was made after two days of meetings in Paris. The alliance stressed that “there is no dialogue nor negotiations with the regime except on the process of [the Al Bashir regime] stepping down and handing over power to the representatives of the people who will lead the transition.
