David Cameron says the death sentence handed down to Meriam Ibrahim is “barbaric” and has called on Sudanese authorities to intervene.The Prime Minister joined international condemnation of the 27-year-old mother’s plight, saying he is “absolutely appalled” by the case.And UKIP leader Nigel Farage has now called on the Government to cut aid cash to Sudan, which last year stood at £42m.Mr Cameron said: “The way she is being treated is barbaric and has no place in today’s world.“I urge the government of Sudan to overturn the sentence and immediately provide appropriate support and medical care for her and her children.“The UK will continue to press the government of Sudan to act.”Meanwhile, Mr Farage has urged the ending of UK financial support for Sudan.He said: “I suspect this particular case is going to shock people, horrify people so much that there will be a renewed debate about where we are spending billions of our pounds every year.”Tory MP for Totnes Dr Sarah Wollaston has also said on Twitter that aid should be conditional on “action to reverse the rising tide of barbarity against women”.But Conservative International Development Secretary Justine Greening argued it would be “totally perverse” to withdraw aid:She said: “British aid to Sudan only goes on helping the very poorest Sudanese people via the UN and NGOs, and not a penny is given to the Sudanese government.“Withdrawing support from thousands of Sudanese families, many also with small children, would only compound this terrible situation. That cannot be right.”Ms Ibrahim was found guilty by a Sudanese court of apostasy in renouncing Islam and of adultery for marrying a Christian, Daniel Wani.She was sentenced to 100 lashes and death by hanging earlier this month.Her death sentence has been suspended for two years so she can nurse her daughter Maya, who was born in prison on Wednesday.There have been claims that Ms Ibrahim may soon be released, but the UK Foreign Office has not been able to confirm the reports.Ms Ibrahim was forced to give birth to the child while shackled to a prison floor after guards at Omdurman Women’s Prison refused to release her.Both the UK and US governments have summoned Sudan’s charge d’affaires to discuss the case.Foreign Office Minister Mark Simmonds told Sky News Britain is doing everything it can to pressure the Sudanese government to lift Ms Ibrahim’s sentence.He said: “We are putting intense pressure on the Sudanese government to do everything that they can to ensure her release.“Hopefully the international outrage will push the Sudanese authorities into a situation where they feel they have to release Meriam.”He said her sentencing was unconstitutional under Sudanese law and in violation of the country’s commitment to treaties that relate to human rights and freedom of religion.The US State Department has described Ms Ibrahim’s incarceration as “horrific” and continues to press Sudanese officials to intervene.US embassy officials have been attending Ms Ibrahim’s public hearings and are monitoring the appeals process in Khartoum.Mr Cameron’s comments follow condemnation from former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and British politicians including Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg.
