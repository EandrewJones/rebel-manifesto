China’s Political and EconomicExploitationof Sudanwithoutthe Call forCeasingtheWars andReachingto JustSustainablePeaceis Deplorable
By Mahmoud A. Suleiman
This article comes against the backdrop of the Sudanese News media reports about as to howthe Chinese economicinfluencein Africa and theImplicationsof thatforSudan.This comes into light whenonelooksclosely at the newspapers published in Sudan. I thought it worthwhile to have a glance at theHighlightsofthe SudaneseNewspapers on Tuesday, September 4, 2018whichreadas follows:
With reference to the above-mentioned headlinesand duringour follow-up of the news from the Sudanese press and the world mediaoutlets, we readsurprisinglyabout the unprecedented involvement of the ruling regime of the National Congress Party (NCP) in the embracing of the political and economic influence of China –aka– the Peoples Socialist Republic of China under the rule of President Xi Jinping General Secretary of the Communist Party of China(CPC), President of the People’s Republic of China, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission.Furthermore, at a glance, an observer will soon realise the grip of the Permanent Member of the United Nations Security (UNSC), the Veto Waving China’s economic invasion of Africa in general and Khartoum in particular.President Xi Jinping set to rule China for life as nation’s Parliament abolished presidential term limits on Sunday, March 04, 2018at the imposing Great Hall of the People in Beijing.Andthus securing a clear path for President Xi Jinping to rule indefinitely as the President and handing him almost complete authority to pursue a vision of transforming the nation into an economic and military superpower.https://www.firstpost.com/world/president-xi-jinping-set-to-rule-china-for-life-as-chinese-parliament-abolishes-presidential-term-limits-4385255.html
Thus, the Chinese president Xi Jinping wants the African heads of state to stay the same as he were for lifethrough the African dictatorial rubber-stamp parliamentsand his positions in the United Nations Security Council(UNSC)onsiding with the Genocidal criminal, fugitive from the international justiceOmerHassan Ahmedal-Bashir stands as witness  to that policy.Theeternal proverbforthe majority of the world’s peoples says,the Birdsof the Feather Flock Together.
Xi Jinping rise has been accompanied by tighter restrictions on civil society, with the detention of activists and lawyers, similar to what Omer al-Bashir and his ilk do and his (Xi Jinping) strict limits on the already heavily controlled internet.
Deb Trap? The allure of Chinese money in Africa has become an important topic for a political Debate in the international media outletsrecentlyhttps://f24.my/3X4X.thttps://twitter.com/F24Debate/status/1037047649747185665
Regarding the difficulties that the Sudanese people have faced during Eid al-Adha of scarcity of cash in the public banks, Sources point out that the liquidity crisis in the banks is mainly due to the attack of the influentials of the regime or the so-called (constitutional) on the public funds (similar to the theft of what remained of the balance) tobetransferred to their accounts in foreign banks abroad where they also possess  their homes and bank accounts that kept those funds; which led to the drying up of commercial banks and their difficulties.https://ara.alrakoba.net/alrakoba-sudan-news2965
It is noteworthy for the reader and the Sudanese public to know the important factofthe total number of so-called constitutionalists in the current Sudanese governmentwhichreached 396who possessand monopolise ‘constitutional power’!Thosesenioraffiliates of the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) regime in Sudan have been waiting silently in the wake of the monitory crisis for the impossible to come raining from the sky miraculously. That was evidenced by the fact that none of the influentials has appeared to people since the outbreak of crises to talk about the nature or how to get out of it!
To fill these constitutional positions, the state provides for each one of them with a private car and an amount of regular cash to rent a house and a monthly salary and along with the amount of money from the public coffers for the treatment and travel abroad for the Constitutionalist and his/her family at least once a year at the expense of the Sudanese people who continue suffering from poverty, disease and the high cost of food items necessary for survival. Worse is that the basic services such as medical treatment, education for children of the citizens remain still not free as well as pre-imposed royalties!
The ruling regime of the National Congress Party(NCP)does not care about the people of Sudan in the camps of the displaced(IDP)who reached at least five million, and the masses of refugees and asylum seekers who live inother countries continuinginneedof a country that accepts and contain them butsufferunder adverse conditionsin theplightof being outsidetheirowncountry for 15 years.
On the other hand, those in the inner circle who know the nitty gritty secrets ofPresidentOmer al-Bashirin such situationsay that the president’s confidence in everyone around him, especially the“old guard”, has been undermined. AndBashir has begunrunningthe state according to his wishes withoutasking the help fromto any of them, as washissometimesdid in suchcasesin the past.And in this regardheasked to listen to the opinions ofsomenon-Islamicacademics workinginuniversities, to see their visionon howbestto resolve economic crises. The report indicated that the academicsin turn reminded him of the Shocking facts. They told him that sixbanks actually collapsed and became outside the state banking service, and thattheother banks are threatened with the same fate in a short period.

In order to save what could be salvaged, the security apparatus, National Intelligence and SecurityServices (NISS) Major General Salah Abdallah “Gosh”,as it was called in the ruling circles, put forward to the President the same idea that Prince Mohammed bin Salman(MBS)carried out in the arrests of the SaudiPrinces andSheikhs whowere detainedinthe Ritz-Carlton in RiyadhHotel.According to the informed Journalist Ustaz Fathi Al-Dow, that theGoshcampaign was stopped or slowed down by order of the samePresidental-Bashir, for two reasons: First, it failed and did not contribute to resolving the crisis as predicted byGosh, and on the one handit wasfearedthattheProcess mighttouch the headsof individuals veryclose tothe President, andworsethan that it is also feared that the tip of the thread would reach al-Bashir himself if he continued on that path.

Political analysts go further and say that Omer al-Bashir is no longer dependent on the National Congress Party, (the Party of Power) and as well as the Islamists, as he has moved to strengthen his dependence on the Triangle of Sudan ArmedForces(SAF)andNational Intelligence and Security Services (NISS)andthe RapidSupportForces(RSF), but the same sources indicated thatPresident al-Bashir’sgreatest interestisin theRapidSupportForces(RSF) first followed by theMilitary(SAF)!
The encrypted Information provided by thescholar Ustaz Fathi Al-Dow said that, some other leaders spoke in the same context. They called for stopping the absurd wars, controlling the epidemic corruption, finding economic and political solutions that guarantee the stability of the homeland and community peace. The group of the high rank Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) also called for raising the level of training and qualification for the armed forces, finding solutions to the problems continue caused by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and raising salaries and incentives for the (SAF). Moreover, the group also called for encouraging the Sudanese citizens to enlist themselves into the armed forces. Marshall Omer al-Bashir was reported to have responded by saying that he received the report of the” intelligence public opinion “and was disturbed by what it has said, but he would deal with the report and what was positive in the meeting. Omer al-Bashir categorically denied that he has been away from the army, and that the rehabilitation of the armed forces, and there will be economic and political reforms in the coming period, and he hopes very much that the coffers are sufficient to meet the needs. A monthly meeting with theleadersand arranging a meeting with the officers described officers and soldiers in different units. This meeting lasted for about six hours continuously, began after theMaghrebprayer and until after midnight. The indirect message was addressed to those who attended the Shura Council meetings, which were mentioned and held after this meeting!
The plain reality confirms that theaccursedregimehas entered (theCoranteen) and that it has actually fallen rather than to say, not because of the life and economic crises experienced by the Sudanese citizen, in the bread, fuel and the lack of Liquidity, drug scarcity, deterioration of education and living conditions, and corruption of values, morals and claims,butbecause of the loss of Sudanese dignity. People will know sooner or later that theIslamism regime hasseenbeforeby itseyes nowand itis the fantasy ofits own,trying to support itselfon Solomon’sstick–nevertheless,as we have said before–the regimehascreateditsowndeath certificate, quoting the motto of UstazFathi Al-Dow: “Thelast words:accountabilitymust be applied onthe perpetrators and access to democracyis inevitableno matter how long the travel to itwill take!!
The head of the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) Party, Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir has lost the right path to rule Sudan and failed abjectly during the three lean decades of his power. Finally he started to sell Sudan in the global market. He entered the Yemen war as a mercenary in lieu of Arabian Gulf Dinars and Saudi Riyals. And he went to Russia, asking its president Vladimir Putin to protect him from the evil intrigues of the United States of Americaand it’sthe conspiracies.Andat the same timehe was beggingandaskingPresident DonaldJohnTrump to remove the name of his regime from the list of countries that harbor terrorism. Not only that, Bashir remains listlessand goestoRecep Tayyip Erdoğan President ofTurkey to provide him with financial and military support in return for granting the Swakin region in eastern Sudan on the Red Sea shore. Furthermore, Omer al-Bashirenters into an agreement calledtheKhartoum Process(KP)– aka –EU-Horn of Africa Migration Route Initiative (Khartoum Processhttps://www.iom.int/eu-horn-africa-migration-route-initiative-khartoum-process)towin Euro Currencies vs.curbing the flow of migration exodus from the Horn of African countries to the European shores via the Mediterranean Sea though the failed state of Libya, he obviously failed by using the notorious former Janjaweed militias turned into so-called the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) which committed atrocities against human rights of those victims.Omer al-Bashir and his regime have never learned from the repeated mistakes.  Instead of calling for peace by abandonmentofthe warsagainst the Sudanese people andcoming into peace and collective democratic rule of the remaining Sudan after the secession of the Southern part of Sudan, Bashir chose hisoppressive measures againstthecomponents of theSudanese opposition, believing that would help himcontinue the ruling Sudan. Hereliedtowaging ethnic wars and using militias and mercenariesto survivehis corrupt, racist andhypocritical regime.
