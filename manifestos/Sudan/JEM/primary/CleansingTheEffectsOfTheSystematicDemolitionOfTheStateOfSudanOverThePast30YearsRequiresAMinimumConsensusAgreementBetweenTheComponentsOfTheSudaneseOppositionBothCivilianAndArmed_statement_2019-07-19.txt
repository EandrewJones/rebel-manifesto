The Sudanese People’s Revolution, which broke out against the ruling regime of tyrant Omar al-Bashir, is not expected to reap its fruits as quickly as possible with the presence of the fifth column and the deep state. Thus, therunning saga between the Transitional Military Council(TMC)and the Forces for Declaration of Freedom and Change(FDFC)is not something unexpected.
I thought it is my duty as a Sudanese citizen to share my views regarding the ongoing negotiations between the components of the Sudanese opposition, represented by the Forces for Declaration of Freedom and Change and the Transitional Military Council (TMC) on the one hand, and the intensive international intervention in Sudanese affairs at this pivotal time. And the other reason for my humble participation today is that my last article was under the title of “Betrayal of the Sudanese December Revolution Continues with insistence.” By Mahmoud A. Suleimanpublished on 05-26-2019 in the SudaneseOnline cyber Journal.https://sudaneseonline.com/
Since then, heavy waters have been flowing in the form of a flood under the Sudanese political bridge. Unfortunately, a large number of unarmed peacefullydemonstrating citizenshave been shot and seriously wounded with live ammunition bullets from snipers belonging to the Sudanese army forces of the ousted regime, as well as the Janjaweed militia forces, and I have called for an investigation into the carnage. Moreover, I prayed for speedy healing for their wounds along with transparent legal accountability to determine the perpetrators of the crime and to impose the appropriate punishment on them.
The current running saga between the Transitional Military Council (TMC) and the Forces for Declaration of Freedom andChange (FDFC) is not something unexpected given the magnitude of the doubts and distrust surrounding the components of theTransitional MilitaryCouncil(TMC), most of which is an integral part of the ruling regime of the oustedNational Congress Party(NCP)led by deposed genocidalcriminal OmerHassan Ahmedal-Bashir.
The political process between theForces for Declaration of Freedom and Change (FFDC)of the Sudanese revolutionaries and the military junta, better known asthe Transitional Military Council (TMC) which is more or less belongs to the deposed regime, is nothing but just anotherepisodein theon-goingsaga oftheircompeting interests for achieving each other’s scoring points. It is clear that the thirty years’ rule of the Dictator Omer Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir who was the seventh President of Sudan from 1989 to 2019 took power through a militaryCoup d’étatand founder of the infamousMuslim Brotherhood Movement(MBM)led National Congress Party (NCP) and ruled the Sudan with iron fist exercising absolute power in an oppressivedraconianand ruthless way until Thursday the 11thApril 2019 when he was overthrown by a popular uprising that became the third SudanesegloriousRevolution on the rowfollowing its predecessors in 21stOctober 1964 and April 1985.It is noteworthy to report that Sudan’s modern history has been plagued by military coups. Since the independence of the Sudan in the 1 January 1956, to date, 62 years ago, more than 11 military coups or coup attempts have taken place, and two popular revolutions have overthrown two powerful military regimes. Since independence, the military has ruled for 45 years, extending over three convulsions, as opposed to 11 years for democratic civilian governments for three periods as well. Other coupsby the military juntasoccurred during periods of military rule and civilians. The coup d’état of the General Ibrahim Abboud inNovember the 11th1958 (6 years), Jaafar Nimeirion 25thMay1969 (16 years) and Omar al-Bashiron30thof June1989 (continuingalmost3oyears as of June 2019) are the most prominent in Sudan.
It is no exaggeration to say that Sudan, since its independence in 1956, spent a lost age among the generals and uprisings until it became exhausted by the current change. The succession of revolutions and coups drained the resources and stability of the country, rupturing its unity and dwarfing its map. The prowess of the Sudanese parties to dispel the democratic sweeps is not matched by the military’s ability to seize any chance of regaining control and seals.

Sudan has now folded the arbitrary page led by Omer al – Bashir. Now it is important to listen tothe voices of thepeopleand restore their confidence. Sudanis in dire need toavoid the risk of slidinginto chaos. This assumes that parties and unions have learned the lessons of the past. Moreover, the Transitional Military Junta Council must have learned lessons from the past itself. Sudan needs a protected stability by the will of its citizens and a government that seeks to compensate for what has been lost, a government that cares about the problems of poverty, unemployment, health services and educationin the shade of the Triad of Freedom and peace and justice.In the history and science of negotiation, it is not expected to obtain all, because of the status of taking and giving in some stages of negotiations. This is more soespeciallywhen coming out of a prolonged oppressive rule as in situationssuch as in the case of Sudantoday.
The Endless To and Fro of the negotiations between the Transitional Military Council (TMC) and the Forces of the Declaration of Freedom and Change (FDFC) and the demand of absolute immunity by the (TMC) for the leaders of the former (NCP) regime including themselves and the reservations of the components of the Sudanese opposition at the Addis Ababa Marathon meetings. Thus, the Marathon negotiations between the Transitional Military Council (TMC) and the Forces of the Declaration of Freedom and Change (FDFC) over the absolute immunity for the leaders of the deposed National Congress Party (NCP) regime continued unabatedwhile thereservations of the components of the Sudanese opposition in the Addis Ababa Marathon meetings continue delaying inking the expected agreement. Worse, being the lack of coordination between the Khartoum group’s deliberations and those of Addis Ababa counterparts led to the renewedconflict betweenarmed groups and the Khartoum’s group Fait accompli agreed document which has turned a blind eye to the rights of the components of the armed movements in Darfur and in the Nuba Mountains and Ingassana.The rebelSudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF) announced its rejection of the political agreement initialed by the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC) and the Transitional Military Council (TMC), saying that the approach adopted was flawed and unacceptable and would complicate the national process.http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article67789

Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell, OM FRS, the British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, writer, essayist, social critic, political activist, and Nobel laureate, has been quoted as saying:  “This idea of weapons of mass extermination is utterly horrible and is something which no one with one spark of humanity can tolerate. I will not pretend to obey a government which is organising a mass massacre of mankind”.https://quotes.yourdictionary.com/massacre

The Poet of the Tunisian Revolution, Abu al-Qasim al-Shabi says in his Poem the Philosophy of the Holy Serpent:
That peace is a lie … and justice is a philosophy of false flame
No justice, but the Power Parity … And the Clash of Terrorism with Terrorism
