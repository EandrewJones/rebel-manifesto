Congratulation for the new leadership of revolutionary movement-JEMDear all,Allow me to congratulate the revolutionary movement-JEM for the new leadership under Gen.Dr.Gibril Ibrahim.It is my ultimate hope that your agenda for regime change in Khartoum may be successful God willing.The demise of Martyr Dr.Khalil should  not be the end of struggle for justice and equality that you have and continue to advocate for.Remember the famous words of late US president Abraham Lincoln “United we stand,divided we fall”The unity that we South Sudanese nurtured brought us our golden independence last July.You in Darfur and other marginalized regions need to come together in order to kick out the merciless and brutal National Congress Party in Khartoum.Long Live JEM!Long Live Revolution!
Congratulations!!Ustaz Diing
