Congressman Donald Payne in our thoughts and Prayers
Congressman Donald Payne, the Democratic representative and one of the leaders of the Black Caucus and the great friend of the Sudanese people and African people in general, is currently facing a critical heath situation. Congressman Payne has been in the front line for years defending unwaveringly the right of the Sudanesepeople for democracy and just peace and he is a friend to a number of Sudanese, first among them was the late Dr. John Garang De Mabior.
We, who know Congressman Donald Payne, call upon all Sudanese who knew him to keep him in their thoughts and prayers with their different beautiful languages and religions for this highly distinctive Congressman and wish him and his family the best.
