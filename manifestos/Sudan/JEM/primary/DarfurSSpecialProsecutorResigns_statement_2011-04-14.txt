Darfur’s Special Prosecutor Resigns
Khartoum — The Sudanese Ministry of Justice issued a statement today revealingthat its special prosecutor for Darfur Abdel-Dayem Zumrawi asked the governmentto accept his resignation.This followed reports this week by local media that Zumrawi, who is also theJustice Ministry Undersecretary, informed the Sudanese presidency in late Marchabout his intention to step down.According to the statement his request was made for personal reasons and has yetto be accepted.Zumrawi was appointed last October as a special prosecutor for Darfur to replacehis predecessor Nimr Ibrahim Mohamed who occupied this position since 2003.But the Justice Ministry stressed in its release that Zumrawi resigned in hiscapacity as an Undersecretary and not as a special prosecutor.Sudan has sought to prove its seriousness in going after perpetrators of warcrimes allegedly committed in Sudan’s western region of Darfur by appointing aspecial prosecutor and establishing special courts.But no progress has been reported in the work of the special prosecutor sinceestablishing the post.The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) referred the situation in Darfur tothe International Criminal Court (ICC) in March 2005 after a U.N. internationalcommission of inquiry concluded that the Sudanese judiciary is unwilling orunable to carry out credible prosecutions in the war ravaged region.To date, the Hague tribunal charged three individuals from the government sideincluding president Omer Hassan Al-Bashir, South Kordofan governor Ahmed Harounand militia leader Ali Kushayb.All three face charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity but Bashir isalso wanted for genocide in connection with claims that he orchestrated acampaign to wipe out the African tribes of Fur, Zaghawa and Masaalit in Darfur.Last January, the state minister for justice Bol Lul Wang told Reuters thatKhartoum has not conducted serious investigations into the alleged war crimes inDarfur. He also claimed that the Sudanese government has no will to go aftersuspects because of the high-level position they occupy.“The prosecutor may find some difficulties taking procedures against them[Haroun & Kushayb] because they are being protected by the government,” Wangsaid.“These people are high figures in the government. The government has no will topursue or even investigate those people … It is not serious. Because if it wasserious they would not let a man like Haroun hold a ministerial post.”An African Union panel headed by former South African president Thabo Mbeki wastasked with working on ensuring that Sudan establish mechanisms to bring justiceto Darfuris particularly through hybrid courts as well as making changes to thepenal code.But Khartoum resisted the idea and Mbeki acknowledged in a report last Novemberthat he had little success in pushing Khartoum to implement his justiceproposals.U.N. officials estimate that as many as 300,000 people have died in Darfur sinceinsurgents took up arms in 2003, accusing Khartoum of neglecting the aridregion. Khartoum puts the death toll at around 10,000.—لقد تلقيت هذه الرسالة لأنك مشترك في المجموعة“AbdinList” من مجموعات Google.للنشر في هذه المجموعة، أرسل بريدًا إلكترونيًاإلى[email protected]لإلغاء اشتراكك في هذه المجموعة، أرسل رسالةإلكترونية إلى[email protected].للحصول على مزيد من الخيارات، يمكنك الانتقالإلى هذه المجموعة على العنوانhttp://groups.google.com/group/drabdin?hl=ar.
