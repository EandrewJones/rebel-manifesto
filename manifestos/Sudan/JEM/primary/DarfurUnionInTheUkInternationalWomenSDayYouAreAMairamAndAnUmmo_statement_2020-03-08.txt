Darfur Union in the UK – International Women’s Day – You are a Mairam and an Ummo
The 8th March is yet another important calendar date. A day to reflect on the trait of constant giving. It is a day to remember those who in spite of all life’s difficulties are able to rise above the challenges. A day to celebrate the achievement of women throughout history in all sectors. A day to recognise the hidden issues that hold women back from pursuing their dreams and goals. A day to celebrate those courageous women of all ages who are fighting injustice and are advocates of human rights. A day to remember the women living in war torn areas, in IDP and refugees camps. Those who face harassment, imprisonment, torture, FGM, rape and killing. A day to celebrate the promoters of women rights and those who raise their voices to seek equal rights for their sisters, daughters, friends and loved ones. A day to remember the women victims of Bashir crimes in Sudan in Darfur and beyond; the victims of systematic rape in Taweela and Tabit. A day to celebrate the high achieving women, in all sectors, the teachers, businesswomen, scientists, doctors, self employed, engineers, house makers etc…
A day to celebrate, to remember and to reflect…we hope your participation in peace making and governance is going to equal to the level of sacrifice.
Thanks to all the mothers, grandmothers sisters, daughters partners and friends. The Mairam* and Ummo*.
