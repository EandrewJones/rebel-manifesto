*Darfur Union in the UK – The Return of Génocidaire Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf*
By Osama Mahmoud
Ibn Auf was sworn in as the Vice President of Sudan on Sunday, 24 Feb. 19. Back between 2003-2007, he was the coordinator of GoS janjaweed operations in Darfur, Sudan. His legacy in the region is Bombardment by Antonov aeroplanes, burning villages, forced displacement and mass rape (Tawila, North Darfur).
Auf was on a May 2007 list of individuals sanctioned by the United States due to his alleged role as a liaison between the Sudanese government and the Janjaweed in the Darfur War.
All of the above was part of what lead to Bashir indictment by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity (ref. 1).
For these reasons, Darfur Union in the UK, will held in an event on Saturday, 2nd March 2019, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Bashir Indictment by ICC; to keep the issue of Sudan in Darfur alive as this date represent means of preliminary victory of missing justice for the victims of Genocide, War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity. Bashir government has no place in Sudan and if he stay alive the hope is to see him on trial at The Hague among his cronies to get the same fate as Radovan Karadzic, aka the Butcher of Bosnia (ref. 2), so that justice can be prevailed.
