Residents of the areas of Malawi and Foda, west of Mellit town, were killed, injured, and abducted in attacks by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces on their villages on Monday and on Tuesday morning.The militia troops plundered the villages, set 16 of them on fire, looted thousands of sheep, cows and camels, and destroyed the water wells in the areas, a listener from Malawi reported to Radio Dabanga.
“The Rapid Support militias arrived to the area in about 150 Land Cruisers loaded with various weapons. Other Janjaweed came on camels and horses. They killed and wounded a number of citizens. Barhoum Eisa (28), Dereij Abdallah Haroun (31), and Yagoub Mastour, known as Yagoub Andi were abducted.”

Thousands of people were forced to flee their homes. “Some of them fled to Mellit town, but the majority sought refuge in the mountains and valleys, in particular Jebel Foda, Jebel Barboush, and Jebel Shag,” the source added.
