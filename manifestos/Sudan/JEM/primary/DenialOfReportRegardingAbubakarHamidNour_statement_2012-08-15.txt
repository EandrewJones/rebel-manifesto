Denial of Report Regarding Abubakar Hamid NourA Statement
Engineer Abubakar Hamid Nour of JEM denies the validity of report posted in Sudaneseonline that Dr. Gibriel Ibrahim, President of JEM has been deposed and replaced by him.The Statement is a work of opportunistic groups affiliated to security agents of GoS.  I call on all honourable friends to remain steadfast on the cause that Martyr Dr. Khalil Ibrahim had given his life for.
