Denunciation and Condemnation of mass rape in Tabit – North DarfurThe Sudanese Justice and Equality Movement- UK & Northern Ireland is deeply concerned about the mass rape crime that committed by the Sudanese government military troops and militias on 31 October, 2014 in Tabit – 35 km southwest of Elfasher – North Darfur.The Justice and Equality Movement – UK & Ireland Office strongly condemns the heinous incident as it constitutes a grave violation of the Human Rights’ Norms and Standards, as well as, an indignifying act which is used as a weapon of war against civil population in Darfur, particularly, women and girls.The Justice and Equality Movement – UK & Northern Ireland Office calls on the International Community, in particular the United Nations to take immediate and unhindered investigatory actions, and ensure that perpetrators are held accountable and brought to justice.The movement reiterates the necessity of implementing the provisions of the United Nation Security Council’s relevant resolutions that are applicable in such situation, namely:– UNSCR UNSCR 1325: 2000 (Women, Peace and Security),– UNSCR 1820: 2008 (Sexual Violence Prevention and Response in conflict settings),– UNSCR 1888: 2009 (Sexual Violence Prevention and Response in conflict settings),– UNSCR 1889: 2009 (women, peace and security),– UNSCR 1960 – 2010: (Sexual Violence Prevention and Response), and– UNSCR 2063 (2012) on UNAMID mandate.Being disappointed by the continuous failure of the UNAMID, the movement office in the UK & Northern Ireland urges and expects the UK Government to take immediate action, and play its well-known positive role and position towards ending impunity, and enhancement of Human Rights situation in Darfur.The Justice and Equality Movement – UK & Northern Ireland Office announces and reconfirms its unconditioned commitment and efforts to work hardly with all relevant partners to restore the well-being of Human Rights violations’ survivors in Darfur region. The JEM reaffirms that, the injustice which is imposed by the Sudanese Government on the innocent civil population in Darfur, will definitely come to an end.
