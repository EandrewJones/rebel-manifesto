Furthermore, on 23 June 2018 the Sudanese Government (GoS) accused the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) – the leadership of Abdel Wahid Nour – of carrying out “provocative” attacks in the Jebel Marra area of ​​Darfur to push the armed forces to respond militarily and to abort a unilateral ceasefire. Some political analysts responded to the foregoing accusation satirically and said: (This is akin to thePhenomenon in the Sudanese folk proverbs that says he hit me, cried and then preceded me complained!). Thus, goes the daily wailing and ranting of the NCP regimeto ask its masters of grace in the Troika to impose sanctions against the Armed Movements in the region of Darfur who have been defending their people since 2003.Moreover, there arethe ongoing airstrikes by the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) in violation of UN Security Council resolutions.Worse is theinter-communal violence, exacerbated bythegovernmentof Sudan (SAF)actionsof “Divide to Rule Doctrine” continued unabated destroying the social fabric.It is ironic that the international communitytodaythreatens to impose sanctions on Abdel Wahid Mohamed Ahmed El Nour andforgettingthattheUS Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick threatened Abdel Wahid and Dr. Khalil Ibrahim in Abuja in 2006 when they refused to sign theDarfur Peace Agreement (DPA)at the time.https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/darfur-peace-process-chronology-24-july-2013The ruling regime of the National Congress Party(NCP)and its predecessor the National Islamic Front imposed on the people of Sudan in Darfur the policy of scorched earth and killed more than half a million civilian citizens and displaced more than three million in the displacement camps and displaced thousands of civilians to neighboring African countries as well as thousands of citizens In the diaspora, while the head of the regime Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir fleeing international justice and pursued by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity and the genocide, and is still a war of extortion is used by the militias Janjawid cloned pro-Chak Sudan, which is called the non-stop rapid support forces, is being waged in the land of Darfur by destruction and corruption. Unfortunately, the troika formed of the United Kingdom, Norway and the United States of America continues to support the ruling regime in return for its cooperation in stopping the migration from the Horn of Africa to Europe and the American support for the regime by lifting the economic sanctions imposed on Sudan since in the year 1997 by the former 42nd President of the United States,William Jefferson Clinton or Bill Clinton, for short, in lieu of curbing international terrorism of the fundamentalist Islamism groups that include the Islamic State inIraq Syria (ISIS)- IKA Daesh which has a foothold in Khartoumsince the start of its first strike and so far, and spread to the neighboring countries, especially to the failed state of Libya.It should be noted that the Troika countries (Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States), condemned  the clashes in the Jebel Marra area between Sudanese Armed forces (SAF) and the Sudan Liberation Army/Movement of Abdul Wahid (SLA/M-AW), and criticized for both parties, calling the international community to punish the spoilers of peace.It is strange that the NCP ruling regime saying that it is still committed to ensuring freedom of movement and access to UNAMID and to all the humanitarian organizations, and calls upon the international community in general and the UN Security Council (UNSC) and international partners in particular to take decisive action against the leadership of the anti-peace group Abdel-Wahid Mohamed Nour, who has been looting livestock, burning villages and terrorizing and displacing innocent civilians. This is said while Omer al-Bashir continues to bomb the Jebel Marra areas in southern and central Darfur states with aerial bombings and the use of chemical weapons, but the international community remained silent about the atrocious crimes being committed by National Congress Party (NCP) army and militia (RSF) by adopting double standards by condemning Bashar al-Asad of Syria in the strongest terms while remaining silent on the use of chemical weapons in Jebel Marra by Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir.Can we call the position taken by the International Community as a kind of collusion or what?

The Nation Congress Party (NCP) and its former ancestor the National Islamic Front (NIF) are unworthy of their nomenclature as experience has shown the people of Sudan in general and those Sudanese in the Darfur region in particular.
