Dr. John Garang’s Vision is the Only Game in Town for the Welfare of the Sudans
Dr. John Garangâ€™s Vision is the Only Game in Town for the Welfare of the SudansTomorrow the 30th of July, as we commemorate the memory of Dr. John Garang and celebrate his life and contribution as well, he would be one of the rare Sudanese who can be honored on the divide of both countries and by many Northern and Southern Sudanese and by Muslims and Christians.  He was and he is above the divide being ethnic or geographical, and he hadcrossed many areas on this great divide.  And as we all know, Dr. Garang was his vision, the vision of the â€œNew Sudanâ€‌, a vision that was essentially and in essence based on the commonality of the Sudanese historical and contemporary and what brings the Sudanese together in the past, present and future, the peaceful co-existence and the common wealth that respects diversity of all forms.Today Dr. Garang is not around, but his vision never dies.  In actual fact, South Sudan and North Sudan they cannot do much without his vision.  They are both very diverse and the massive majority of the two countries are marginalized and only the vision of the New Sudan can deliver peace, food, democracy and stability.  Both countries cannot achieve progress without true recognition of their diversities in a true democratic state that respects human rights, the rule of law and accountability, builds a caring society that would address the issues of marginalization including womenâ€™s rights and taking â€œtowns to people, not peoples to townsâ€‌, the famous jargon of Dr. Garang.  The two countries are in need of such a great vision.Dr. Garang was a true democratic Pan Africanist who believed in the unity of Africa from Cairo to Cape Town and as charity starts at home, he was for the unity of Sudan and he made the biggest attempt to preserve that unity on a new basis against all odds.  Now as we have two Sudans, the vision of Dr. Garang remains valid and needed by both countries, and it is also valid to re-unite Sudan, a unity between two independent viable countries and democratic states that share the same values.  The present situation full of challenges and liabilities that can be changed into assets requires a huge work and struggle by all democratic forces in the two countries.  Areas such as Blue Nile and South Kordofan can be and they should be a role model of economic and social integration between the two countries given the historical and social ties as well as the rest of the border states between the two countries.As we commemorate and celebrate the life of Dr. Garang by those who are from Northern Sudan, for us Dr. Garang is a true son of Northern Sudan as well as of South Sudan.  He is a point of link between the two countries and a great hero of our lifetime, and in my humble opinion, he was the most important Sudanese personality in the last century, and it will take both Sudans fifty to one hundred years to bring a wonderful charismatic leaders such as him, full of sense of humor and intelligence, a real human being.  The good news is that his vision remains valid and never dies.  In fact, it is the only game in town for both Sudans.Yasir ArmanJuly 29, 2012
