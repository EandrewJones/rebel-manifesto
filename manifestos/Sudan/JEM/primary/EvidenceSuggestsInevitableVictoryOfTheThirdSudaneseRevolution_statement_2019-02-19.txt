By Mahmoud A. Suleiman
Thisis Third SudaneseRevolution, which broke out in December 2018,andhas been going on for theSixty Twodayswithout a pauseisworthy ofTriumphant Victory. It isas itstwo Predecessors of theGloriousOctober 21, 1964Revolution, and theUprising of April 6, 1985. This more true, giventhe unprecedented solidarity of the people of Sudan which is by all measures worthy of ending the tyrannical rule of the individual in Sudan. Furthermore, the Uprising People of Sudan are united more than ever demanding change that seems inevitableeven if the regime rules it outandunleash hisrabiddogs of murdererswho are theMasked members of the shadow brigadesthatbelonging to Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, who admitted their existence. Thus, this ongoingunprecedented solidarity of the people of Sudan is worthy of ending the tyrannical rulebyoneindividual in Sudanto protect himself from the grip of the International Criminal Court(ICC)in The Hague, which has been haunting himday and nightsince 2009when the first arrest warrant was issued over the heinous crimesOmer Hassan Ahmedal-Bashir perpetrated against the civilian Sudanese citizen in the Darfur region.
What the title of this article refers to is not a kind of wishful thinking, but it is a product of the laws of life,Laws of the universe,human experiences and the the findings of scholarly studies around the world and throughout human history.
The Student activist and revolutionary blogger Mujahid Ahmad quotes in his article entitled “Until spring may lose the way!” that throughout history, a revolution has not failed because the regime that came out against it was cohesive or because its security apparatus was strong and arrogant. This has never happened. From the point of view of the ruling regimes, revolutions – especially peaceful ones – represent a real catastrophe that makes the pillars of government no matter how strong And the authoritarian trembling from the bottom to the top.
The popular revolutions are truly confusing to all dictatorial regimes, the National Congress Party (NCP) Islamist entity is by no means an exception and it is almost impossible to stop them. The famous Frenchman Gustave Le Bon Charles-Marie Gustave Le Bon,theFrench polymath whose areas of interest included anthropology, psychology, sociology, medicine, invention, and physicsandbest known for his 1895 work The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, which is considered one of the seminal works of crowd psychology.The famous Frenchmantalked about the masses, especially the revolutionary movements, and their deep belief that it is an invincible force. This faith turns into a real reality. The goals that came out for it, here in particular the confusion of the systems climax, and start statements lame andfluttering stampede from the mouths of officials, expressing the state of helplessness and confusion that they are living, they are rats, infiltrators, agents for foreign powers and spies, etc.

The reaction of tyrants to revolutions throughout history and the diversity of countries remains very similar, similar to what is known in psychology as the five stages of surrender, which begin with denial: “There are no demonstrations, then it turns to rage: “These are saboteurs,rats, infiltrators, agents for foreign powers and spies, etc..
The natural trendin the final quarter of the life of the revolution, after experimentation and confusion, the tyrant begins to realize that the security solution of killing and harassing therevolutionarymasses will do nothing but inflame the anger in the souls more and more and add new groups that were neutral to the circle of revolution. Theforegoing will eventually lead tosoft handling and the calls for dialogue and evasionby the tyrants such as Omer al-Bashir and his criminal entourage.The political will not find any of the earswithinthe ranks of the rebelslistening to the intrigues of that kind.
What does the tyrant do then?
Well, the tyrant will not do anything. At this very moment, the tyrant’s thinking and entourage becomes limited to the search for emergency exits and the search for a formula that guarantees a safe exit that will anger the public and the evil of accountability.
Speak up for the people of Sudan. The people of Sudan are united more than ever demanding change in Sudan. Your voice can help bring their demands into reality.
Afterwardsthe stage of bargainingbegins: “when the(NCP)regimePresidentbecomes conciliatory, admitting that the infamousPublic Order Law,which puts all injustices and punishments against women by beating them with whips, is an unjust law that should be stopped.More than 45,000 complaints were issued against women under Sudan’s Public Order Act during 2016. “Students, working women, and especially food and tea vendors have received the lion’s share of physical and verbal violence.”https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/45-000-women-prosecuted-under-public-order-act-sudan-activists
Accordingly, though rather too late, Omer al-BashirCallsnow calls for the repeal of this unjust law that lasted for decades punishingSudanese women. Moreover, al-Bashir as part of his conciliatorydialoguehepromisesthathe would not to contestthepresidential elections in 2020, for example.Nevertheless, thegenocidal criminal, fugitive from the International justice, chased by the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague in the Netherlands, Marshall Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashirwould not admit the other grave atrocious crimes he and his regime perpetrated over the years. Andsuch tyrannicalregimesthencomes the stage of depression and sadnesssaying to the angry public:” I understand you “as said, addressing his popularly uprising peopleby theoustedformer Tunisian PresidentZine El Abidine Ben Ali.Andfinally comes the recognition of the impossibility of steadfastness in the face of the masses and turn the tyrant into a deposed or runaway or isolated.These are the classic stages of successful revolutions.There are anxieties and restlessness in the circles, ranks of the corrupt fat catsand corridors of the ruling regimeof Omer al-Bashir trying to escape before the flood to Tehran in Turkey or to Malaysiaor elsewhere. In general,there is unrest among members of the Sudanese Islamic Movement during the uprisingofthe people of Sudan to find a way out fortheir organization which is close to falling.There seems to beanew group of Islamists working to finalize a new coordination to support the protest movement and to demand that President Omer al-Bashirtostep down andthattheallegedcoordination is expected to be announced in the comingfewdays.https://twitter.com/Sudafax/status/1097108964746166272
The National Coordinating Committee for Change and Constructioninitiative has been reported to include some ofprominent Islamic leaders in the government and the opposition, headed by Ambassador Shafie Ahmed Mohammed, former political secretary of the ruling National Congress Party and Dr. Mustafa Idris, formerVice Chancellorof the University of Khartoum, in addition to the groupreferred to as “Saihoon-translated as“Tourists”. In general, the groupincluded a number of Islamists who took part in the military operations inSouthern Sudan during the civil war.Furthermore,somemembers of the groupwent with the PopularCongressParty (PCP) headed by the late Dr. Hassan Abdalla al-Turabiafter splitting, famously known as“Mufasala, translated as Haggle”in the year 1999 and theothers wentwiththeNational Congress Party (NCP) led by Omer al-Bashir whilesomeotherskept themselvescompletely away from the government and practiced as they say a kind of communication with all parties, but failed to convince the various groups to reunite, the factorwhich promptedthem to launch an initiative four years ago.Since the emergence of their group,the “Tourists”have been talking about the corruption that has spread in the country andas tohow to deal with it and whether the current government is capable of confronting it.
On the other hand, the Sudanesepoliticalopposition sent an urgent statement toOmer al-Bashir demanding the dissolution of the government and parliament.Twenty-two Sudanese parties, most of them participating in the government, signed a memorandum on Tuesday, 1 January 2019, to Sudanese President Omer al-Bashir to demand the dissolution of the Sudanese government and parliament.
The parties demanded in a statement read by a spokesman at a press conference to form a transitional council to lead the country, in addition to forming a transitional government that combines competencies and political representation, according to Al-Arabiya channel. The statement went on saying: “The currentregime, and its political, economic, regional and international isolation,cannotovercome this crisis, which can only be overcome by a new regime in Sudan,” a statement by the Front, which includes a number of Sudanese parties, read in a statement.The statement of the opposition, which includes a number of Sudanese parties, followed by a spokesman at a news conference broadcast by the channel “Al Jazeera”:“The regime, with its current structure, and its political, economic, regional and international isolation, cannot overcome this crisis, which can only be overcome by the establishment of a new regime in Sudan that will restore the confidence of the people and international relations in a balanced manner based on mutual interests and mutual respect so that Sudan can be removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism “it said.. “

The statement added: “The only way to remedy the imminent political and economic collapse is to take exceptional measures through the formation of a transitional sovereignty council to assume sovereignty, and to form a transitional government that combines competencies and political representation without quotas, in accordance with a program and priorities that will stop the economic collapse and end the isolation. Sudan “.Furthermore, the statementpointed out that the programmeof the transitional government must “achieve peace, and oversee the holding of free and fair general elections, led by an agreed prime minister inwhomcompetence, experience and national acceptance will be met.”The statement stressed that the transitional government must “take fair measures. First, dissolve the National Assembly, the Council of States, appoint a national consensus council of 100 members, dissolve the state government and its legislative councils, set an appropriate date for elections according to progress in the file of peace and consultation with political forces, And the formation of the Electoral Commission and the National Committee of the Constitution. “
It is known that Sudanhas beenwitnessing widespreadpopularprotests because of the difficult economic conditions that started on December 19, 2018, following the government’s decision to increase the price ofthe loaf of breadthree times in a country suffering from a recession.Uprising erupted and began from the City ofAtbara,followed byDamar, Berber, Karima, Sennar, Gedaref, Khartoum and Omdurman witnessed major demonstrations that resulted in the death and injury of dozens of citizens.The calls went to alltheregionsofSudaninwestern Sudan,in theDarfurregion, Kordofan,ineastern SudanofGedaref, Port Sudan and Khashm al-Girba, as well as the regularralliesof the Sudanese people in the Diaspora countries inNorthAmerica, USA, Canada,Australia,European countries of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlandsand the countries of the African continent whereallthe Sudaneseactivelyparticipatedincludingyoung and old. The contribution of Sudanese women exceeded all perceptions. All the Sudanese Chanted the Same Famous Slogan: “Tasgot Bas”along with theCheers that echo:“Freedom,Peace, justice andRevolutionisPeople’sChoice”!Omer al-Bashir’s trips around the world to Cairoin Egypt, AnkarainTurkey, the Arab Gulf states andto Addis Ababa inEthiopiaand elsewhereare not expected to be of any use to save him from thepredicaments of his bad deeds of killing, corruption, racism,nepotismand thedilemma that brought the country into disaster andalong with thedestructionusing theDemolition machine, the Pickaxe,duringthe threeleandecades of failure and dictatorship.
It is noteworthy for the ongoing Sudanese people’s uprising for the record that at last the Sudanese government has acknowledged the killing of31people since the start of protests demanding the departure of President Omar al-Bashir, while international human rightsorganisationandthe Sudaneseopposition forces numbering up to51peacefully demonstrating peoplewere killed bythesecurity forcesmade up of the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS)inand the notorious former Janjaweed cloned militias, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) atdifferent parts of the country.
Since the beginning of the uprising,as of Monday 18 February 2019,the Sudanese people have gone onsixty-oneconsecutive days without stopping the marches and demonstrations against Omer al-Bashir and his government demanding to overthrow him and change to the rule of law and good governance and decent living for allwithout discrimination.Earlier, a group of professionals and the leaders of the Declaration of Freedom and Change announced for the first time the participation of opposition leaders and political forces in the rally on Thursday, called the “procession of departure” to thePresidentialPalacein Khartoum, carrying a memorandum demanding thePresident to step downwithoutanyregretstothedemise of hishatefulregime forever.The statement issued by the group of professionals and coalitions participating in the protests said Thursday this week “comes differently and we will all emerge from the tripartiteNational Capital of Sudan andfromtheregions andprovinces in the procession of departure, which will go to thePresidentialPalace in Khartoum, accompanied by political, civil, professional, social and religious leaders.https://sudanjem.com/2019/02/%D9%88%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A7-%D8%A5%D8%AB%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84/
In the previous period, heavy dusthas erupted around the so-called shadow battalions referred to by the former First Vice-President Ali Osman Mohamed Taha in his dialogue with the channel (Sudanese 24). At the interview, Ali Osmansaid that the regime battalions were defending him even if it sacrificed the spirit for him. Some observers interpretedthespeechof Ali Osman Mohammed Tahain the context of the threat of the battalions of hidden fighters will appear in the street, especially with these protests, and it was explained that what happens during the protestsof the shooting and killing by masked armed forces asdue to thesebattalions. However, the National Congress Party (NCP) spokespersons refuted it, saying that Ali Osman’s remarks carried more than it carried and takenOut of context. They are not battalions to fight, and Ali Osman himself said they understood in their own context .President al-Bashir’s speech yesterday during his meeting with the Popular Defense Forces(PDF)recalled the previous controversy when he pointed out that the talk of the support brigades has been modified by what is understood as an attempt to remove the misunderstanding of the former Ali Osman talk about these battalions. The presidentOmer al-Bashirstressed that they are peaceful,said adding that they are brigades fordevelopment, reconstruction, human building and peace, but called for the formation of other battalions, but electronic.
The forces (masked) within the protests are what Ali Osman’s shadowforces.What Omar al-Bashir said about the shadow forces of Ali Osman Mohamed Taha to justify these crimes will not change anything in the crimes committed by the regime, which continued its regime during the three decades against the people of Sudan.No matter how long it will take, the Sudanese people will be able to prosecute the elements in the (NCP) regime for the crimes they have committed and will not escape accountability, rule of law and transitional justice.
Christopher James Gilbert, better known by his pseudonym Criss Jami and by his alter ego the Killosopher, is an American poet, essayist, existentialist philosopher, songwriter, and the creator/designer of Killosopher Apparel has been quoted as saying:“Time and time again does the pride of man influence his very own fall. While denying it, one gradually starts to believe that he is the authority, or that he possesses great moral dominion over others, yet it is spiritually unwarranted. By that point he loses steam; in result, he falsely begins trying to prove that unwarranted dominion by seizing the role of a condemner.”https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/464083-time-and-time-again-does-the-pride-of-man-influence
It is worthy to quote someExcerpts from thePoetry ofthe PoetAbū al-Qāsim ash-Shābbīthe TunisianPoetwho is probablybest known for writing the final two verses of the current National Anthem of Tunisia,has said:“If the people one day will to live then destiny must respond and the night must disappear and the chain must break. Those who never been cuddled by the passion of life will evaporate in its air and perish.So if the souls will to live, then destiny must answer”!

Rights groups say more than 1,000 protesters including opposition leaders, activists and journalists were arrested on the streets during the almost daily demonstrations, which have been calling for President Omeral-Bashir to step down.The brutality and hostility of the security forces towards the protests is making people braver and braver – it feels like an unstoppable momentum for change as more people join them. Moreover, on Sunday16thFebruary 2019, the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which represents health workers, lawyers, teachers and others and has become the organiser of the demonstrations, posted that protests would take place in most residential areas of the capital, Khartoum.
