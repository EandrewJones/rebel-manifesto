Darfur Union in the UK plea to the United Nation Security Council and UK government to open an International lead investigation with regards to the latest crimes and violations of human rights taken place in central Darfur by the government troops. It is high time for the world to turn the attention to Darfur and other war torn areas such as Nuba Mountains and Blur Nile State, as it appears a second Genocide is unfolding before our eyes. Some governments in the world are still providing support to Bashir and his regime; the international community must act by applying pressure on these governments to stop supplying war equipments, which are used directly to kill the innocents across the Sudan. Also more pressure must be applied to allow humanitarian aid agencies to have full access to provide much needed medical attention, food etc… to the locals.
We will continue to provide regular updates we receive from the ground. Copies of this reports plus the aforementioned accounts will be sent to the following:
1) Office of International Criminal Court’s Chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda,2) The Sudans department, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, UK3) United Nation, UNAMID Central Press Office, Khartoum4) Office of Secretary General, United Nation5) Office of President of African Union
