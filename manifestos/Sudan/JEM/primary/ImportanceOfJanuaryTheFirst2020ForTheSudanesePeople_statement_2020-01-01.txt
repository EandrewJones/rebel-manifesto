Based onthis important event, theSudanese people wondertoday,on this first day of the month of January 2020,as to whattheFateDestinyandtheUnseen conceal, God willing, for them this year whichhascome after theGlorious PopularRevolution of theNineteenth of December 2018, which continued during thewholeyear 2019 to cleanse Sudan of the crimes and dirt of theNational Congress Party (NCP)regime.The (NCP) regimeruled Sudan throughits corruptoppressive militarycoup d’étatand committed crimes against humanity, war crimes andcrimes of genocide.The Génocidaireremained at largefugitive from international justice in The Hague in the Netherlands since 2009evading arrest warrants issued on 4thMarch 2009and 10thJuly 2010 but heexploited the 30years of Sudan’s life as a waste. This aforementioned criminal is Marshal Omar Hassan Ahmed Al-Bashir
And on this day, every Sudanesemanand Sudanese woman wishes that the year 2020 will be a year of goodness, health, blessing, stability, love, freedom, peace,justice andwelfare for all that is left of the people of Sudanafter the forcedsecessionof its people in the Southern region.
Currently, the Génocidaire OmerHassan Ahmed al-Bashirhas been put inaCorrectionalReformatoryPrisonfor his old Agefollowinghis convictionof a charge ofcrimes offinancial corruption, where millions of foreign currencies were foundhiddenin his home.
In these pivotal moments, one would like to extend warm greetings to the revolutionaries of the Sudanese people who declared the Popular Glorious  December 19th2018 Revolution, andcongratulate them on coming of the new year 2020, which will be warmly welcome by all of us, and we all hope for achieving comprehensive peace in all parts of the country, and we take this opportunity to all components of the Sudanese people for their commitment to loyalty to the obligations of patriotism and to achieving a comprehensive, just and full democracy. In this New Year, let us make it a year for humankind, change and development.
Asallof usknow in Sudan that the past year 2019 was a year full of accomplishments and major changes, which were represented in the falland demiseof the ruling regimeofwhat is called the annihilatedRescue, and thiswas without a shred of doubt avictory over the forces of darkness, injustice and reactionarywhichwould not have been achieved without theparticipation ofrevolutionariesinthe armed and civil struggle of the forces of the Sudanese Revolutionary Front(SRF)and crownedbyTheSudanese public made up of young, middle aged, women and men along with thestruggles of theForces ofDeclaration ofFreedom andChange(FDFC) and especiallyafter the Sudanese Revolutionary Front(SRF)participated in its formation and therebirth of theRevolution.
While happily we bid farewell to the past year 2019 with joy of the revolutionary accomplishments that have been achieved, we at the same time we bid it a farewell with deep sorrow over the fall of innocent and defenseless civilians as victims in El Geneina, West Darfur State. Based and building on what is going on in El Geneina now, the Transitional Government of Sudan must intervene immediately and decisively to stop the bloodshed and impose state prestige as soon as possible and hold those involved in this heinous crime to account so that it does not happen elsewhere. Furthermore,and in these moments, we ask Allah Almighty to bestow mercy on all the defenseless, innocent martyrs who have fallen and console their grieving families, and declare our full solidarity with the wounded, and we wish them a speedy recovery. At the same time, we condemn in the strongest termsthese terrible heinous crimes.It is needles to reaffirm the fact that we have gone miles searching for peace, which is the firm conviction, of all the components of the Sudanese people in addition to their deep belief in the unity of Sudan, which will not come without political agreement, which if it does not take place, we will remain in a state of dissonance, and this may lead to instability chaos and more fragmentation in the country. Everyone is now required to look at the cause of the country away from any partisan or personal gains.
In conclusion, one will repeat what was stated by the pen of the President of the Sudanese Revolutionary Front, that we in Sudan seek to achieve a comprehensive just peace, according to the Juba Declaration for Peace in Sudan. We are keen on making the New Year 2020 a year of peace and stability, while we send sincere warm congratulations out to the citizens of Sudan, the Christian brothers on the occasion of Christmas Festive and this New Year, and every year, hoping everyone with freedom, peace and justice.
EachNew Yearoffers an exciting opportunity for a fresh start and new beginnings, which is probably why we all look forward to New Year’s Eve2020so muchso!
