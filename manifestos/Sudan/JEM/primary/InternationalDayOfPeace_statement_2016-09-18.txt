For this great day, the United Nations Secretary-General Mr. Ki-Moon, has said:
“The people of the world have asked us to shine a light on a future of promise and opportunity. Member states have responded with the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, it is an agenda for people, to end poverty in all its forms. An agenda for the planet, our common home. An agenda for shared to prosperity, peace, and partnership”[1]
Onthe 21 of September of each year , is consider to be an international day of peace , what is this mean and reflect , and what the International community should and must  reflect on?
The International community should reflect on the conflicts that going on around the world, especially in African , Latin America and Middle east , the world should and must deliver hope to those people whom find themselves in the middle of armed conflict zone, to those whom caught up , to those whom in poverty for a long period of time , to those whom are dying every day as the result of diseases and infection which can prevent it , if the world come together and help those most need it.What the International community really should and must reflect are , to the children and women in the war zone , a clear example for that are , the women and children in Yemen whom been targeting every day[2]it has estimated that more than 2,800 Civilian population have been killed 60% of the are children and women , they have nothing to do with this war , all this cause by Saudi lead airs strikes, moreover more thousands of civilian population been displacing as the result of the airs strikes[3].
