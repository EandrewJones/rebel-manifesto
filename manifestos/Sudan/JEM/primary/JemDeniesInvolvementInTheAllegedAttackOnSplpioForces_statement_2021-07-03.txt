JEM Denies Involvement in the Alleged Attack on SPLP-IO Forces
In a communique signed by Col. Paul Gabriel on behalf of SPLM-IO, the Spokesperson claimed that forces belonging to South Sudan Government and in alliance with JEM attacked their bases in Mboro, Wau, June 29th, 2018.
JEM categorically denies any involvement in the alleged skirmish between the warring parties in South Sudan. JEM has no forces or military equipment in Wau, the alleged base of the attackers, or elsewhere in South Sudan. Further, the war in South Sudan does not serve the cause for which JEM struggles. For JEM, all South Sudanese are brothers and countrymen who were forced to create their own nation. Peace in South Sudan benefits Greater Sudan, and war damages the future of both nations.
JEM takes this opportunity to congratulate our Southern Sudanese leaders for their framework peace agreement, signed last week in Khartoum, and wishes them every success in its implementation for the sake of the masses who suffered hugely as a result of the wars.
