JEM is not involved in the Current Crisis in Libya
A StatementAs usual and without much shame, GoS is trying once again in a clearly racist tone to galvanize support in the Middle East and beyond, alleging involvement of JEM in the current Libyan crisis:
–JEM has no force in Libya and will never ever intervene in Libyan internal affairs.
–JEM has no fighters outside Sudan at all and could not have crossed the Libyan-Sudan borders without permission of its staunch enemy, GoS that controls the border.
–The Libyan-Chadian borders are equally guarded by joint forces of the two respective governments, bound by nothing except their enmity to JEM.
–While GoS is free to play its muddy water tactics, we remind them once again that JEM’ future plans are focussed on Khartoum and not Tripoli.
