JEM Mourn Death of Mr. Payne JEM have received news of death of US Congressman Donald Payne with utter sadness and deep sense of loss.   Congressmen Payne was a champion of Human Rights and a great crusader for justice and equality across the globe.  His tireless work for the oppressed and relentless support for the marginalised people of Darfur, South Sudan and Nuba Mountains was an inspiration for all of us to work forfreedom, justice and dignity.  He was indeed a voice for the voiceless and a power for the powerless and had firmly laid the foundation for relegation of Genocides in Africa to the dustbin of history. JEM offer their sincere condolences to his family as well as to the American people, and in particular President Obama at the untimely loss of Congressman Donald Payne.   May the great hero rest in peace.  Gibreel Adam BilalSecretary for Media & Official Spokesperson for JEMLondon07/03/2012
