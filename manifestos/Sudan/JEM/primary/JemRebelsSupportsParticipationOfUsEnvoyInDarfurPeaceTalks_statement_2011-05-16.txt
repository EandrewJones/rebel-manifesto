May 15, 2011 (DOHA) — The Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) declared its support to the participation of the US envoy for Darfur saying his presence allows transparency in the talks and encourage the parties to engage constructively.

GOS should “leave the obstructions and unnecessary tactics and to come for negotiations in good faith,” he further said.Tugud went to say that the presence of the international community members will support the mediation as well as the negotiating parties to “engage constructively, to show leadership and responsibility” for achieving a peaceful settlement.The mediation delayed a stakeholders conference to give more time to the two parties to discuss the pending issues particularly Darfur administrative status and the security arrangements. However Khartoum kept accusing JEM of being in Doha to sabotage a peace agreement it plans to sign with the Liberation and Equality Movement (LJM).JEM top negotiator praised Dane Smith for the efforts he exerted in the process since his appointment, he further called on Khartoum to not block the coming of JEM delegation to the venue of the peace talks from the field.“It would be impossible to achieve a negotiated settlement without allowing JEM negotiators to come” to Doha, Tugud said. This blockade “demonstrates clearly that the Government of Sudan has not yet taken a political decision to resolve Darfur conflict with the Justice and Equality Movement,” he said.The Sudanese authorities blocked UNAMID efforts to collect JEM commanders from the field due to the lack of authorization from the government despite the repeated demands formulated by the mediation.While the direct talks between GOS and JEM delegation are stalled, Sudanese government hopes to close the talks with the rebel groups by signing a peace agreement with the LJM and inviting the other rebel groups to join it at the end of the month.(ST)
