— The rebel justice and Equality Movement (JEM) said ready to resume direct talks with the government delegation in Doha when the latter reaffirm its willingness to discuss the administrative status of Darfur region with them.Following the issuance of a presidential decree by the president Omer Al-Bashir to conduct a referendum on Darfur administrative status by the end of march, JEM stopped its participation in the Doha peace talks and asked the withdrawal of the referendum decree.The rebel delegation in Doha however remained in Doha and the mediation sought to convince JEM to resume direct negotiationsbetween them and the government delegation over the wealth sharing chapter.Gibreel Adam Bilal told Sudan Tribune on Sunday that their delegation declined a meeting with the government today and asked first to meet with the mediation alone to determine the agenda of the talks between the two parties.We want Khartoum to start direct talks with us on the administrative status of the region and to reaffirm that this issue will be debated here in Doha, Gibreel said. He further added that the discussion of the other pending issues will follow after this meeting.“Our observations on the wealth sharing are ready and we will hand it to the mediation once this meeting is held,” he emphasized.The rebel Liberation and Justice Movement (LJM) and the government have already handed their observations to the mediators on the four chapters dealing with the Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Justice and Reconciliation, Compensation and Return of IDPs and Refugees and Wealth Sharing.LJM has already also submitted its final remarks on the two pending issues related to the power sharing including the administrative make-up and final security arrangements. The rebel group insisted on the representation of Darfur region at the Sudanese Presidency and called to regroup all Darfur states under a transitional regional Authority. They also demanded to disarm Government armed militias and to reform security organs.The mediation said the outcome of the talks should be agenda of a general conference for all Darfur stakeholders scheduled initially to take place on 18 April but delayed for the end of the month.Gibreel said they asked to facilitate the arrival of the “true” representatives of the displaced civilians stressing they have already handed a list to the mediation which pledged to ensure their presence in the conference.
