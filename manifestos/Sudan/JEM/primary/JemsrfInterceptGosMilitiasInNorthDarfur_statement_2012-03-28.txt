Government militias went active again in North Darfur, yesterday March 26th.  They burnt down villages of Anka, Bireedeek and Nago Jarra.  In their attack, they killed an unspecified number of people, looted animal wealth and dismantled water pumps that supplied water to these villages.  Local people called in a JEM contingent nearby which swiftly moved to their rescue.
The militia suffered a crushing defeat and were chased by JEM troops up to the outskirts of Al-Fashir.
