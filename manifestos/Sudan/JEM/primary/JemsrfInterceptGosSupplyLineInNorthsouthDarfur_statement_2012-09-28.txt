JEM/SRF Intercept GOS supply line in North/South Darfur
A Military Statement
Yesterday, September 27th, GoS received a devastating blow at the hands of JEM and other SRF partners near Tabit at the borderline between North and South Darfur States.
Our forces engaged a large convoy destined for post rainy season supply of GoS troops in Jabal Mara area.
Overlooking destroyed government military vehicles, our forces gained numerous trucks loaded with military hardware, fuel and other logistical supplies.
It is to be noted that SRF forces that participated in the engagement included SLA-Minnawi, SLA-Nur and SLA-Karbino
We thank Al-Bashir for badly needed supplies that have been received intact and at the right time.
Long lives our struggle for justice and equality.
