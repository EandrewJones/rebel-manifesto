Khartoum Appeal Court upholds execution of six JEM commanders.
A Statement from JEM/SRF
In utter contempt to international law, Khartoum once again shows its utter lack of commitment to UN conventions on prisoners of war.   Khartoum’s Appeal Court has just issued a ruling clearing the way for execution of the following JEM commanders:
1 – General Ibrahim al-maz Deng2 – Ustaz As sir Gibriel Tiya3 -Ustaz Mahjoub Ahmed al- Gizouli Izz-al-Arab4 – Commander Ibrahim Abdalla Safi el Nour5 – Commander Mohammed Daoud Khamis6 – Commander Yahiya Abbaker Mousa
According international laws, these commanders are prisoners of war and should have never been put on trial in the first place.    More over, since the capture of these commanders, JEM released many SAF- POWs with the help of the Red Crescent/ Cross.  We appeal to all humanitarian organisations and the international community to intervene and prevent unlawful execution of these war prisoners.
JEM will certainly strike back if Khartoum proceeds with its evil plan.
Long live our struggle for justice
