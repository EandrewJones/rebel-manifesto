Invites you for Mass Demonstration in London on30th June 2012الدعوة بالعربية.:ARABIC ZAKIDear Supporter,As the Islamic National Front regime in Khartoum prepares to celebrate its 23rd year in office since they hijacked the elected government by a military coup in June 1989, we are planning a mass demonstration in London to spoil their blood-stained party. Your personal and collective participation in this demo is utterlyvital to show the world our commitment and support to all those marginalised people in Sudan and especially the children and innocent civilians currently under attack from ongoing aerial bombardment in the Nuba Mountains that they are NOT forgotten. This will be an excellent opportunity for all Sudanese political parties, Sudanese and British civil society organisations, friends of Sudan and the media to come together in unity to strongly highlight and condemn the calamitous situations in Darfur, Blue Nile, Abyei, East of Sudan and the Nuba Mountains. Please come and bring posters of your choice that reflect and represent the dire situation in Sudan.We will all meet at Lancaster Gate at 13:00 and walk to No. 10 Downing Street where our rally will settle and ultimately hand in a petition to the office of the prime Minister. A Press conference is also being organised to take place immediately after the demonstrations ends. Several leading British and international media organisations have been in contact with us regarding the demonstration.Please contact the following people for further information:ARABIC ZAKI
