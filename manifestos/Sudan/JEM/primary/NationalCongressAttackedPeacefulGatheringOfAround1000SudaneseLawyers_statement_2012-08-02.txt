Today, August 1st, the police and security of the National Congress some hours ago attacked a peaceful gathering of around 1,000 Sudanese lawyers who gathered in the lawyers’ club in Khartoum for a Ramadan break fast and in order for them to look into the human rights situation in the country.  They were beaten and some of them arrested from inside the lawyers’ club premises in Khartoum.  This came less than 24 hours after the massacre of Nyala for the students.The attack on the lawyers marks a full-scale lawlessness not in the marginalized areas but in the capital, Khartoum, and against the guard of law, the lawyers.  The Bashir regime is getting crazy everywhere against all groups, students, women, youth, marginalized groups, professionals, and today, their dinner was to attack the lawyers.  They took breakfast and lunch by massacring the students in Nyala and the lawyers for dinner.  What happened in Nyala is similar to what the apartheid regime in South Africa did for the students of Soweto in Johannesburg in 1976, when they massacred Hector Pieterson and his colleagues.   It is what the Sudan regime did earlier on some years ago when they massacred the Beja in Port Sudan and the people of Kajbar Dam in the Northern State.  We are appealing for lawyers from all over the world to stand in solidarity with the Sudanese lawyers.Yasir ArmanSecretary General, SPLM-NorthAugust 1, 2012
