Nuba Mountains Solidarity Abroad in UK and Republic of Ireland – AGMDear sisters and brothersGreetings to you in the name of our noble land of Nuba Mountains, I hope you are all well. I’m writing on behalf of NMSA executive committee to inform you that it has been a year since we were elected to office on 2nd April 2011. According to NMSA constitution we should now be holding our Annual General Meeting this week. However, due to circumstances of my continued ill health which had persisted for more than 3 months andfurthermore due to the recent restructure of our executive committee and various other developments as well, I would like to state that the AGM will not be held as it should have been during this month of April. I will invite you all to the AGM at a later stage once our circumstances are settled sometime during this year.If you have any queries that you wish to be explained regarding this delay or otherwise, please do not hesitate to contact me or any other member of the executive committee for further details.I would like to bid my extended gratitude and appreciation to all Nuba community in the UK and other parts of the world who were able to physically or thoughtfully support us preparing for last Saturday’s demonstration in London. This much appreciated effort is also extended to our friends, political parties, human right groups, advocates and all those individuals who managed to make it to the demonstrations to voice out our extreme concerns to the atrocities, ethnic cleansing and mass human-right violations which are presently taking place in the Nuba Mountains and of course also where our sister Awadiya G. Ajabna was recently murdered in a coldblooded manner.We in the NMSA executive committee will continue to vigorously lobby by means of advocacy as widely as we can to ensure that those people who are currently being arrested, tortured and imprisoned without any justification or jurisdiction will be released in a dignified demeanour and the Sudanese government are held responsible and accountable to those grave misconducts and killings which they are committing against Nuba people throughout the country.Zeki Samwiil JanguulChairmanNuba Mountains Solidarity AbroadUnited Kingdom & Ireland
