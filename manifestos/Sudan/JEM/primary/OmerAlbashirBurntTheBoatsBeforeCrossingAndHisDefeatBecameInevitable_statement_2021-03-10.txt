Omer alBashir burnt the Boats before Crossingand his defeatbecameInevitable
By Mahmoud a. Suleiman
Second Military Coup D’état of Omer Bashir will Not Protect him from his inevitable fate at the hands of the uprising Sudanese people
The angry uprisingmen, women and youth of thepeople of Sudanhave beenloudly chantingover the past 81 Days as of March 10, 2019sayingdefiantly: “Despite your militias, mercenaries, militarization of your regime and your Second Military Coup D’état, Marshall Omer al-Bashir you have no savior and you will be inevitably   defeated and ousted by the Popular Revolution of theDisenfranchised Sudanesepeople into the rubbish dustbin of history with your kindof castaway tyrantsof the World”!.Furthermore, they further added saying: “Our Sudanese compatriots previously revolted against two military dictatorial regimes in October, 21, 1964 against General Ibrahim Abboud and in 1985 theyupraised againstthe Dictator Jaffer MohmedNimeiri;both Popular Revolutions led to the Overthrow of the dictatorial regimes.”History is the biggest neutral Witness to what we, the people of Sudan say to you, the isolated,defeated,genocidalcriminal and the globalpariahMarshall OmerHassan Ahmedal-Bashir”!
This article comes against the backdrop of the appointment of Omer al-Bashir to the eighteen military officers as Governorsforthe States of Sudan as well as the appointment of Lt. Gen. Awad Mohamed Ahmed Ibn Auf, Defence Minister as 1st Vice-President, relieved First Vice-President Bakri Hassan Salehand appointing a group indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, the Netherlands since 2004 for committingthe most heinousabhorrent and despicablecrimes againsttheSudanese civilian citizens in the Darfur regionand remaining fugitive from the International Justice.
Omer al-Bashir has transferred his authority as chief of the National Congress Party (NCP) to Ahmed MuhammedHarun. It is noteworthy that previously, this Ahmed Harun served as State Minister for the Interior, and played a central role in coordinating and planning military operations in the Darfur region between the years 2003 and 2005. Moreover, Ahmed Harun in the 1990s he was responsible for massacres in the Nuba Mountains and was nicknamed “the Butcher of Nuba.” The worse is still pending, in that, Ahmed Muhammed  Harun and Awad Ibn Auf were among Khartoum’s senior leadership and have acted as liaisons between the Government of Sudan (GoS)  and the Government-supported infamous notorious Janjaweed militias, which have attacked and brutalized innocent civilians in the Darfur region of western Sudan. The two individuals also have provided the Janjaweed with logistical support and directed attacks. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and more than 2.5 million people have been displaced by violence and war since 2003.It is clearly seen that Omer al-Bashir has chosen his First Vice President, rulers of the States and members of his cabinet as well as the chairperson of the National Congress Party (NCP) from the List of the 51 accused as criminalsby theformer (ICC) Prosecutor Luis Gabriel MorenoOcampo.
It is important to bring to the attention of the readers that the US Department of the Treasury on 5/29/2007 blocked the assets of a number of Sudanese individuals, including two high-rankinggovernment officials Ahmad Muhammed Harun, Sudan’s State Minister for Humanitarian Affairs, has been accused of war crimes in Darfur by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague as well as Sudan’s head of Military Intelligence and Security, Awad Ibn Auf, was also designated.https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp426.aspx
The militarization of Sudan will not stop the revolutionary tide of the people of Sudan. And that the revolution of the hungry, the downtrodden, the widows and the bereaved will not stop until victory is achieved by the demise of Omer al-Bashir and his corrupt and hypocritical faction in the name of the Islamic religion, while all their actions indicate the opposite of the true Islamic religion.
And our evidence that the Sudanese people are inevitably victorious in the current battle against the genocidal criminal Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir is the following:

Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, though not different from his ilk oppressive tyrants, he boasts as superior to them.It is beyond doubt that tyrants do not learn from history and live in the illusion that they are able to overcome difficulties and that they will emerge from crises by force and further abuse against peoples. Nevertheless, as have been said earlier that it is beyond doubt that Omer al-Bashir’s Second Militarycoup d’état will not protect himand his criminal entouragefrom his inevitable fate at the hands of thedisenfranchisedrebellingSudanese people Starting from all regions and states of the country. And their goal is one and only one which is the end of the rule of the chronic tyrant to join hisilk ofpariahs.
Edward Morgan Forster generally published as E.M. Forster, the British novelist, essayist, and short story writer who was known best for his ironic and well-plotted novels examining class difference and hypocrisy in early 20th-century British society. His humanistic impulse toward understanding and sympathy may be aptly summed up in the epigraph to his 1910 novel Howards End: “Only connect” hasbeen quoted as saying: ““I swear from the bottom of my heart I want to be healed. I want to be like other men, not this outcast whom nobody wants.” “I was a young, & had deep loves, & my heart would overflow with enthusiasm!”https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/86404.E_M_Forster

One of the advantages of theRevolution of December 19, 2018, is that the Sudanese people in general and the people of the capitalKhartoum in particular,represent a great example for unity of the masses of the country. In that,people acrossthecountry realised without a shredofdoubt that what happened to the people of Sudan in the Darfur regionatthe hands of Omer al-Bashir and hisJanjaweedmilitias was a major crime.They chanted saying: “OYou theArrogantRacial Bigot OmerBashir we are All Darfur “!!It is worth mentioningand noting that Omer al-Bashirwho is misogynous and hates and despites womenhas previously made obscene remarks against the Women of Darfur in a way that is abusive and humiliating, where one avoids mentioningand writing.As the popularproverb goes:“EveryVessel Exudes its Contents” Nevertheless,,thecourageous Uprising SudanesePeopleChantedrepeatingtheirFamousSloganduringtheRevolution “Down withit – Tasgot Bass!”
APoem that onehas learnedduring theGood SchoolDayskeepsComing back echoingin one’smindrepeating the thoughts of the Revolutionary Tunisian Poet’sfamous verses from hisPoem, TheWilltoLife:
The Will to Live
If the people one day will to live then destiny must respond and the night must disappear and the chain must break. Those who never been cuddled by the passion of life will evaporate in its air and perish. So beware to those who don’t desire life from a slap of the victorious nothingness! Thus told me the living organismsAndwhat their concealed souls reported to me. And the winds banged between the crevices on top of the mountains and underneath the trees. If I have the ambition to achieve a goal I will climb up my desire and forget any precaution. I don’t avoid the dangers of the routes or the blazing fireball. Those who don’t like climbing the mountains will live forever in holes. So, the youth’s blood has filled my heart, and other winds have roared in my chest. I pondered, listening to the rumble of thunder to the winds’ music and the rain’s cadence. And the earth told me when I asked: “O Mother Do you hate humans?” “I bless those who have ambitions and those who enjoy taking risks and I damn those who don’t flow with the times and those who are complacent about life, life between the stones.
