Omer al-BashirRemainsClinging toPower byall Means
By Mahmoud A. Suleiman
Omer al-Bashir has little choice as he is unpopular at home and sought by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for his indictment following the arrest warrant issued for the first time on Wednesday the 4thMarch 2009 for the crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide he has perpetrated against the Sudanese civilian citizens in the Darfur region Western Sudan. Thus,Bashirhas little choice, but tocontinue trying all possible avenues and outlets to avoid arrested and incarcerated in dungeon at The Hague in the Netherlands. Bashir has tried every avenue to keep himself on the helm of Sudan at all cost. He even lately,coinciding with the Sudanese popular uprising, media reports indicated that Russianspeaking mercenaries havebeen helping al-Bashir in cracking down those peacefully protesting and chanting“Tasgot Bass”publicwho demandthedemiseof theNational Congress Party (NCP)regimeonce and for all.
The Sudanese government has denied reports that Russian mercenaries are aiding security forces in cracking down on anti-austerity protests that have rocked the country over the past month.Moreover, theSudanese Interior Minister, Ahmed Bilal Osman, dismissed a report by theTimesthat published photographs of troops – allegedly from the shadowy Russian military services company Wagner – in the streets of Sudanese capital Khartoum in December. The images show dozens of white men dressed in camouflage, being transported in trucks as they observe anti-government protests in the city.Despite the demonstrations’ peaceful nature, security forces have responded with violence.https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190114-sudan-denies-russian-mercenaries-involvement-in-quashing-protests/
As usual, al-Bashir hasvowed not to relinquishhis 30-year rule, stressing that the current demonstrations are the result of aforeign conspiracyand heridiculed the Sudanese opposition partiesandclaimed thatSudanhas beenexposed to a foreign conspiracy.To blame Somebody Else “BSE”Bashirstressed that Sudan had been subjected to a foreign conspiracy since 1955, in addition to an ongoing war and economic siege for more than20 years.

OnWednesday19thDecember2018,the Sudanese government decided to triple the price of bread,whilecashwithdrawalfrom Sudanese banks isalmostdifficult to obtainunless impossible at times the owners of accounts in banks and exchangepointsprompting a wave of anti-government protests which swiftly escalated into demonstrations calling an end to the three-decade rule of Sudanese PresidentOmar Al-Bashir.Thecore idea rests around the fact people have reached to and recognised that thoseindividualswho believe or think that Marshall Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir would leave powerin Sudanto step down or resignof his own free will areIllusional and at worstmight be at adelusionallevel.Thousands in all districts of the capitalKhartoum and other cities and regions all over the Sudan beganchanting freedom, justice and peace and demanding the overthrow of the regimewith their usual mottoof:”TasgotBass”.
In his evening speech on Friday night, Omer al-Bashir wanted to Mislead the people of Sudan, who are rising up all over the country, calling for the demise of the Muslim Brotherhood Movement (MBM) government with its multiple falsehood nomenclature, which began with the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), the National Charter Front (NCF), the National Islamic Front (NIF) and then the ruling regime of salvation (aka Ingaz), the National Congress Party (NCP) and the Popular Congress Party (PCP) under the respective leaderships of candidates,  Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir and the late Dr. Hassan Abdullah al-Turabi. The trick and the scenario was where Omer al-Bashir to become President at the former Republican Palace of Gordon while Dr. Hassan al-Turabito goto the neighbourhood of Cooper as Prisoner.Thus, the misguidance of the people of Sudan is the principle of the ruling regime since coming to power through the military coup on the night of Friday, June 30, 1989.
Here the reader finds that lies which is one of the biggest sins in the Islamic religion taken by the leaders of the International Muslim Brotherhood Movement (MBM) theKhartoum Branchas a principle to deal with the people of Sudan the majorityof whomare devout Muslims and who believes every word spoken by the one who pretended to be a good Muslimevenif the content of his/herwords seem untrue.Here we can point out perhaps the non-real saying attributed tothe German Political PhilosopheKarl Marx who was said to have said: (Religion is the Opium of the People).Nevertheless, what he meant was that religion represented like opium for the deprived poor peopleunder the exploitationof therampantcapitalism.https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/05/karl-marx-200th-birthday-communist-manifesto-revolutionary
There iscompellingevidencethat this group of Muslim Brotherhood entity in Sudan has the ability to change its colour as achameleon forthe purpose of camouflage, deception and fraud. It is simply resorting to the principle of the End Justifies the Means that of the Italian diplomat and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli, aka Machiavelli the Prince.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince
This Omer al-Bashir who assumed power in a 1989 military coup, has always poised to cling to powerby all means, and this clearlymeans greatercrackdown on the peacefully protesting Sudanese public resulting into moreviolence and economic paralysis for Sudan and a new stage in a dark history ofthe National Islamic Front/ National Congress Party (NIF/NCP) regime.firstly to avoid beingapprehended by the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague in the Netherlands for the crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of genocide he has perpetrated against the Sudanese civilian citizens in the Darfur region in the western part of Sudan when they asked for their share of the wealth and the Power of the country. The current decisions taken by al-Bashir during the popular uprising of the disfranchised Sudanese majority isnothing but a renewedmilitary coup d’étatpar excellenceand more arbitrarydictatorship and political polarization.At this time, as if history is repeating itself and taking us to theDark Agedays of Jihad warfareinSouthern Sudan as it was called in previous eras.During the current popular uprising,Omer al-Bashir has returnedall theretired militarycommanders to the service and appointed them as Governors of theStates; as well he appointed General Awad Ibn Ouf as his First Deputy and appointed a newsecretary of state for defense.Furthermore,al-Bashirre-appointedretired Major General Naeem Khader Morsal and retired Major-General Tayeb al-Mesbah Osmanandreturnedthemto service and promoted them to the rank of theLieutenant General and sent them to retirement!.The foregoing steps taken by al-Bashir are reminders of thaterawhichwitnessedatrocious scenes of a long civil war between the mostly Christian and animist south Sudan and the Muslim andallegedArabized northSudan.At the time, Omer al-Bashir and histhen ‘GodFather’Hassan Abdallaal-Turabi hostedthe Saudi Arabiancitizen,Osama bin Laden in the early years of hisJihadiMovement that led to the creation of al-Qaida,hencelandingSudan a spoton thepolitical radar of theUnitedStates ofAmerica(USA)under the Presidency of the former PresidentBill Clintonwhoput Sudanon thelist of countries backingand sponsoringterrorisminNovember 1997.TheSecretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said theUS PresidentBill Clintonacted against Sudan “because of its continued sponsorshipof international terror, its effort to destabilize neighboring countries and its abysmal record on human rights, including religious persecution.”President Clinton slapped wide-ranging economic sanctions on the hard-line Islamic government of Sudanat the timeand ordered the seizure of Sudanese government assets in the United States.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/11/05/clinton-imposes-sanctions-on-sudan-freezes-assets/05cd5848-8a2d-4615-a320-11a4f4596965/?utm_term=.340beb586625
Omar al-Bashir, like the chameleon, is trying to change his mainly failed diplomatic dialoguewith the international Political pole and diplomatic axesand is trying to get closer totheUS President Donald Trump, but he quickly changes his position, then visits Russia, meets with President Vladimir Putin, complains of America’s aggression and demands protection from him.It is really pitifulbut not only that, Omer al-Bashir tried to converge and then movesaway in his diplomatic relations with the international community and the AfricanUnion (AU)community andhis relations with the Islamic world and his fragile relations with the League of Arab States as well as his participation in the war in Yemen,  Code-named Operation Decisive Storm (Arabic:عمليةعاصفةالحزم‎in the role of mercenary.https://www.google.com/search?ei=hfV2XKfHGr6S1fAP_tuM4As&q=The+Name+of+the+war+in+Yemen+is+operation&oq=The+Name+of+the+war+in+Yemen+is+operation&gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i160.35906.46239..49492…0.0..0.117.932.11j2……0….1..gws-wiz…….0i71j33i22i29i30.96JtNgin4rw
Thus,miseryto the people of Sudanerupted several times into protestsduring the reign of al-Bashir. The recent uprisings include the 2013 uprising that resulted into the massacre of around 200 young people in Khartoum the Capital of Sudan,along the current ongoing intifada of all the people of Sudan where more than 66 people were killed by live ammunition by masked security elements. Ineach timethe primary culprit isdowntoal-Bashir. He has tried to do the same in the latest unrest, sparked on Dec. 192018. It was, initially over steep price rises and shortagesof liquidity in the Bank. Dozens have been reported killed, and al-Bashir has arrested opposition leaders, imposed emergency rule and curfews in multiple cities and suspended classes in schools and universities.Nevertheless, the World knows for fact that the State of Emergency has been as a fait accomplifor more than a decade in the Darfur region as well as in the Nuba Mountains, in the Ingassana of South Blue Nile territory and in parts of theBejaethnic Cushitic peoples inhabitingtheenclave in Eastern Sudan.
Bashir’slean29 years in power will likely be rememberedafter his regime gets demisedas the mostbloodthirsty, oppressive, racist and sadisticin Sudan’s modern history. During the dark rule of the Muslim Brotherhood Movement (MBM), Omer al-Bashir began by trying to militarily crush the southern rebellion. Predictably, it did not work.Sadly and regrettably, the people of the former Southern Sudan opted for secession after a ground breaking results of a popular referendum and formed the Republic of South Sudanand making the former Sudan’s map looking so small, ugly and deformed.The true Sudanese citizen hates to view it as a result of the extreme uglinessof imageof the amputated looking Map of the current Sudan ruled by Omer al-Bashir and hisfew small-mindedIslamismbigots.
From Khartoum, his rule was based on his Islamist-military alliance, presenting himself as a leader of the 1990s wave of “political Islam” while building ties with violent jihadis. Using Islamist ideology as a rallying cry, al-Bashir created loyalist militias to protect his rule and built a political machine of businessmen and politicians that held a lock on power and amassed massive wealththrough corruptionin the impoverishedbankrupt remaining Sudanese nation after the secession of thesouthern part of it taking with it three quarters of the oil reserve and one third of the population and a fertile potentially prosperous land.Not only that, al-Bashir and his regime continued their ingrained racism and nepotismwhich contributed to the impoverishment of the public through unemployment and the closure of the road to theaccess to theremaining resources of the country’s wealth.
His renewed imposition of Islamic law alienated many and tore apart the social fabric of a countrywhichrichwithreligious and ethnic composition. His use of Islamic militias in Darfur made him an international pariah.Thus, al-Bashir has kept all Sudan a hostage for hissafety fromthe gripping hand of the International Criminal Court (ICC) which has beenchasing himunder the arrest warrant since the 2009, and remaining fugitive from the International Justice.Omer al-Bashir is not afraid of anything in his life day and night andduring his rest as well as during his shuttle travelsmore than thegrippinghands of the International Criminal Court(ICC). Andin exchange for avoiding this Omer al-Bashir will do everything against the people of Sudan, especially Sudanese citizens of Darfur, who are believed to have been behind his convictionon the crimesCommittedin the region.
The Troika Said that the future of the relationship with Sudan depends on the government’s military dealings with the protesters.
The Troika countries “Britain, America and Norway” have renewed their concern about the developments in the situation in Sudan and said that the new military government’s handling of the protesters will determine the future of dealing with Khartoum.

Tharwat Gasim, in his article asks as to why Bashir chose his new first deputy from the List of the 51 of Ocampo.

It is noteworthy thatOcampo,to which the said article has referred to, as the world knows, is Luis Gabriel Moreno Ocampo who is an Argentine lawyer and the First Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC). He is renownedfor chasingand hunting the world’s worst war criminals and the Génocidaireswho have been indicted with arrest warrantssuch as the Sudanese regime President Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir and his ilkand broughtsome ofthem to trial at the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague in the Netherlands.However, Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir remains fugitive from the International Justice todateand since the date ofWednesday4thMarch 2009.Moreover, there are 51 individuals from the inner circle of al-Bashir accused as being implicated in the crimes perpetrated in the Darfur region and ordered by those accused to be carried out by the proxy the then Janjaweed militias.The evidence for Bashir’s choosing his entourage from the indictees of the International CriminalCourt (ICC) is that hehas appointed Ahmed Haroun as an acting chairman of Sudan’s ruling party, the National Congress Party (NCP). Ahmed Mohmed Haroun, the former Governor (aka Wali) for the North Kordofan State, has been indicted by the (ICC) for his role in the heinous crimes the regime perpetrated in the Darfur region, and obviously remaining fugitive just as his master of grace, Omer al-Bashir.

On the other hand, as many would not know,there aresomany security agencies, militiasand party youth battalions belonging to thehypocritical so-called IslamicMovementand the National Congress Party (NCP) regime.
Dr. Fagirey Mohamed Ahmed, in Canada, spoke to President Omar al-Bashir on what could work to remove the stalemate that Sudan has entered as a result of the failure of the National Salvation Revolution (aka Ingaz) over the last three decades. Themessage of Dr. Fagirey waswordedvery strongly, but it was too late as they cameafter thepens lifted and the ink got dry, so to speak. That said, thosewise swords have already been isolated and the uprising Sudanese public have already reachedto the station where their final say landed they do not think there is a solutionto thecurrent impassebut “TASGO BASS” and Bashirto leavewithout the presence of anyone shedding tears for the reason that the National Congress Party (NCP) rulein Sudan has come to an end. The Sudanese people echoed saying:”This is the only reform we want”!
TheRuleofLaw andGoodGovernance havecompletelyvanished from the radar anddisappeared in Sudan against the oppressive laws accompanying the imposition of thestate ofemergency law for one year and the composition of the Council of Ministers of theretiredarmy officersalong with First Presidential Deputy a military General and worse of all Bashir remaining the President for ever.
In spite of the brutal crackdown and the policy of “shoot to kill”, Protestershave come out almost daily since the wave of protests began on December 19, 2018 due to the high price of bread andother basic commodities as well asthe lack of access to the funds depositedinbanks, which became the biggest challenge facing Bashir.onThursday (February 28th, 2019),More than 1,000 anti-government protesters demonstrated in and around the capital Khartoum witnesses said. Those are thoughtthe firstpopularmarches sinceBashir imposed his year-long arbitrary Emergency laws and setting up punitivecourts across the country on Tuesday to tackle ongoing unrest for more than two months.Witnesses said security forces fired tear gas at about 400 protestors in the city’s major Omdurman markets, facing Khartoum on the other side of theRiverNile. Protesterscontinued callingfortheend to Bashir’s 30-yearoppressiveruleandchanted “Down withit –aka Tasgot Bass.”!
The world has seen enough dictators and their atrocious ways, but there are a few who lifted the level of brutality to another height; Omer al-Bashir and his National Congress Party (NCP) regime are among thelatter.
