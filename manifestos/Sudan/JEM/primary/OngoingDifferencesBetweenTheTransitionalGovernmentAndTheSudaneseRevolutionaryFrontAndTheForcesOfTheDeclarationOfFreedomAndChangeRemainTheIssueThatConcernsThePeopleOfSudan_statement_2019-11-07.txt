By Mahmoud A. Suleiman
As the proverbgoes,thedifference of opinion does not spoil amityanddoes not spoil the friendliness issue.On the other hand, mere differences ofpoint of viewand differences of opinion do not spoil the friendliness of the issue of partners in a common goallike freedom, peace and justice chanted by the rebellious Sudanese public componentslast December.
This article comes against the backdrop of a number of issues relating to the Post December the 19thGlorious Revolution among which is the reported concerns of the Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF) about the expected appointment of state governors by the Transitional Government which is seen by the SRF as a breach of Juba declaration.sofar, many important goals have been achieved. Revolutions usually have countless demands as we have seen it among the peoples of the world everywhere and there are many undoubtedly vivid examples today.We may not need to give examples while we see what is happening in Hong Kong, Algeria, Iraq, Pakistan, Libya, Tunisiaand as well as thecurrent conflicts in South American nations such as Venezuelaandlet alonetheAfrica’s Deadliest Conflicts inSouth Sudan and the Central African Republic(CAR).Thus,as if theCountries of theworld eachoneis wagingwar on itself!
OhYou Sudanese peoplewho are themost patient, resilientandresistant to arbitrary rule tell youthat whathasbeendestroyed by the demolition pick during 30oddyears cannot be repaired in less than twelve monthsafter the Glorious December Revolution.Patience and hard work are needed to achieve the higher goals we are looking for.But this does not diminish thelegitimateaspirations of theSudanesepeople to reap the fruits of theirRevolution.At the moment, we hope that this kind of talkshouldnotbe taken as a kind of lettingdown to thelegitimateaspirationswhichurgethe people towardsfastreapingthe benefits of their continuous efforts.
But isn’t it time to stop the skirmishes between the components of the Sudanese political opposition and focus towards getting Sudan out of the abyssal grip of the terrorist Islamism regime led by the currently deposed  notorious genocidal criminal, fugitive from the International Justice  Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir and hisdefunctcorrupt entourage?http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article68451
The time of getting out of the era of clutches of injustice, nepotism, corruption and warfare seems around the corner, but the forbearance among the leaders of the Glorious December 2018 Revolution seems in short supply.
The three groupsmade upof the Forces for Declaration and Change(GAHT), Sudanese Revolution Force (SRF)and the Transitional Sudanese Government (TSG) whorepresentthe main Ripe fruit of the Glorious Sudanese Popular 19thDecember 2018Revolution,and these three who areSupposedlyfriends with one Task to implementbutseem to be brawling, blaming each other ever since the Flame of the Revolution Started to Fade slowly.Of course, no one denies the achievements of the trio referred to in the previous lines.And we should not be like looking at the empty part of the pot instead of considering the full part as the saying goes because the achievements of the trio are too many to be denied only byindividuals who are characterizedbyextremeingratitude.Given the abject deliberate failure of the deposed National Congress Party (NCP) regime to make peace in Sudan over its autocratic 30 year rule that characterised by crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide, the post December Trio referred to in the previous paragraphs,without any thread of doubtit could be a game changer.This is more so for the Sudanese people who suffered and have experienced the scourge of attrition wars. They know all too well the difference between life in constant wars and the coming of a just and sustainable peace.
It is worthy to mention among so many other benefits of the post Revolution achievements and at this juncture let us give it a thought into the maiden visit to the Province/regionof Darfur, in particular to El-Fasheral-Sultan, as it is referred to, by theTransitionalSudanese Prime Minister Dr. Abdalla Hamdok and his accompanying delegation, inspired by the revolution’s slogans of freedom, peace and justice. The delegation’s firstfoothold wasthe three main Camps for the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) of Zamzam, Abushouk and al-Salam.The main purpose of the visit is to identify the conditions of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and to work urgently to address their problems that persisted during the years of war that broke out in 2003 and provide services and work on their return to their areas of origin with the provision of services, as well as providing security and the removal of tribal fighting along with working hard towardsthe removal of those who occupied the lands of indigenous people without right.

Furthermore, the Prime Minister Abdullah Hamdouk announced the convening of a National Conference in the coming days to discuss Peace issues and ways of achieving them. Hamdouk also called on all parties to unite, join efforts and leave all kinds of differences and work to create an atmosphere for Peace during a speech at the University of El Fasher as part of his visit to the State of North Darfur in Western Sudan, which beganon  Mondaymorning the 4thof November 2019.https://sudanindependent.com/news/politics/2019/11/04/%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%83-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA
With the same theme, Hamdouk stressed that achieving Comprehensive Peace is one of the priorities of the next stage, stressing that they have confidence to achieve peace and tolerance among the components of society, indicating the seriousness of the transitional government to return the national project to unify the Sudanese people.Dr. Abdullah Hamdouk also explained the government’s endeavor to address the economic crisis suffered by the Sudanese people resulting from the accumulation of the wrong policies of the former regime.
While  Addressing the mass meeting of displaced people in Zamzam camp,hepraised the struggle of the Sudanese woman, pointing out the importance ofheractive participation at all levels to build a democratic and free Sudan.
The demands of theInternally DisplacedPersons (IDPs)included the need to address the root causes of the problem in Darfur in order to achieve a just and lasting peace, and allow humanitarian organizations to return immediately to contribute to the role of providing services to the displaced, and stressed the importance of providing all perpetrators of genocide, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity in Darfur, including the head of the former regime In addition to the disarmament and demilitarization of all militias and battalions without procrastination, and the establishment of regular national forces loyal to all parts of the homeland. The representative of the(IDPs)stressed that the implementation of their demands represents the first step of reconciliation between them and theTransitional Government.Thecrowd who metDr. Hamdok as hevisited camps inEl Fashirshouted“We want justice!

Hamdouk expressed his happiness with the speech of the representative of the displaced and the slogans they raised and called for peace and justice. He called on everyone to cooperate and work together to bring Sudan to safety.
There is an important part that has not been included in the article, because it was not approved by the components of the armed struggle movements on the formation of the Legislative Council. Thus, the armed movements outside the important political institutions such as the Transitional Council of Ministers and the Sovereign Council and the restructuring of all state institutions such as undersecretaries of ministries and commissions and then proceed without the accompanying armed movements to the appointment of state governors on a date setbefore 17 November2019.
As the world knows that the conflict that erupted in the Darfur region in 2003 left hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced, the constituted the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), Refugees and those tried to cross the Mediterranean Sea for a “better life” in the Overseas, especially Europe.Unfortunately, large numbers of young people have drowned in the deep sea to become food for whales, while those who survived the sinking became a commodity in the slave market at the mercy of human trafficking lords in Libya and elsewhere.
