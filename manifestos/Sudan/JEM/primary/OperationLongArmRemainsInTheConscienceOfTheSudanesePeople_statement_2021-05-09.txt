Operation LongArm Remains intheConscience of theSudanesepeople
By Mahmoud A. Suleiman
Sunday the 10thof May 2020 will mark the12thAnniversarysince theForces of theGallantSudanese Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) launcheda calculatedand a well-planned attackon the Three Town Capital of SudanKhartoumwhere theMaster of the poisonousserpentMuslim Brotherhood entityheadused to dwell andexist.Although twelveyears havepassed since itslaunch, theMemory of theOperation LongArm (OLA)remains in theConscience of the Sudanese people.Despite the fact that theOperation longArm (OLA)wascarried out by the Sudanese Justice and Equality Movement (JEM)and enteredtheSudanese Three Town -Capital Khartoum openly during the Daylight onSaturdaythe10th ofMay 2008, itstill remainsvividin themoral sense of the Sudanese public.That Military Operation started across the barren Sahara Desert devoid of trees and bunkers, and exposed to the enemy Military Aviation and prone to warplanes bombardment by the MiG- 29, Sukhoi bombers and Antonov airships.  The (JEM) forces hadtraveled avery faraway distance of more than a thousand kilometers.It is also noteworthy that JEM attracted its membership from diverse Sudanese tribal and ethnic backgrounds, belonging to at least 67 tribal groups, from Darfur, Kordofan, the Central Region and other regions of Sudan including members from the far Riverain North and as well as from the Nuba Mountains and the Southern Sudan. Therefore, this has categorically refuted the state owned media propaganda machine’s absurdly portrayal picture of JEM as a solely Zaghawa monopolised Movement.One of the citizens of the regions other than the Darfur region may ask about the reasons that prompted the Sudanese Justice and Equality Movement to take up arms against the central Government in the Capital Khartoum. In this window, let us browse the history of Sudan to know the extent of the systematic injustice that the Sudanese citizens in the Darfur region have through the ages and under different regimes.
The Injustice imposed on the citizens of Sudan in the Western Region of Darfurisapartand parcelof the total crisis that the countryhassufferedfromsince Independence; in fact a continuation of the policies of the former colonials.And therefore it is wrong for anyoneto think thatwhat the people ofthe Darfurregionare doing is nothing buta kind of nervousness, racism and regionalism.The one whoeverthinks that the Darfur crisishas no genuinegrounds thattype ofindividualshould be consideredlivingin the darkness of misinformation.The people ofSudan inDarfur areusuallyseen from some sectorswith suspicion, and accused as havingnogenuine cause to complain as though they are just stirring up unfoundedIssues that do not exist.
Therehas beena questionthat remains lingering in the minds of many peopleas to whetherDarfur hasa fair and objective issue, or is the matter merely a claim that is not supported by the facts?
The answer to this question requires looking at the situation in Darfur from the historical, geographical, developmental, political, economic and administrative point of view to see howthe people of Darfur are objective andhavejustand genuineissue and it is not a claim or fatwas on abstract facts.
The Darfur community consists of multiple social components and diverse cultures that blended and fused, resulting in a rich civilization with unique features, expressedin the form ofKingdoms and Sultanates through the agesand developed Civilization and good governanceand establishedthe teachings of the true Islamic religion free from hypocrisy, corruption and injustice..
This richandaccumulated experiences, devised patterns of systems, customs and mechanisms, which organized social life, and arranged how to exploit the wealth of resources enjoyed by Darfur, and put in place measures that address conflicts when they occur.
Despite the aforementioned background, the region of Darfur and its citizens have been subjected to injustice and oppression.It is really unfortunate that while this happens, we find the situation in Darfur has deteriorated in the way it has become a subject of international public opinion and witnessed the largest peacekeeping missionknown as theUnited Nations–African Union Mission in Darfur(UNAMID) the largest missionin the history of the United Nations. On the other hand, Darfur has remained throughout its history difficult for the legions of colonialism, and it has been making sacrificesafterthe sacrifices,that instead ofbeingappreciatedand considered a source of national pride andtreasure,but itwas seen with the eye of ingratitude andthanklessness, from manyregimes, Sudanesehistory tells.Thus,Darfur suffered a double burden from the homeland and the colonial powers alike as we will seein the next paragraph.
Darfur has faced Turkish-Egyptian colonialism for about sixty years, as well as Anglo-Egyptian colonialism for about twenty years,along withthe people of Darfursupportingthe Mahdist revolution and achieving the country’s first independence, throughout the years of struggle against the colonizers.  The people of Sudanin Darfur regionremainedcohesive with theothermarginalized citizens inSouth KordofanNuba Mountains,Ingassana in theBlue Nileregion andEastern Sudan Beja people sufferingthe experience and services of theforeign and internalcolonizers, which created an objective difference in development and basic services between Darfur and the rest of Sudan other than the forgotten areasreferred toabove.It suffices to note that the first school opened in Darfur was fifty years after the first school opened in theCentralSudan.TheSudanese cadresthat usedby the colonial powersto administer Sudan until independence were trained and contributed to the development of Northernand Central Sudanbut obviously notDarfur and similar areas. They were managed by the security cadres of the Colonial Intelligenceservices, whose mission was to imposethelaw of the closed territories that was applied to the Darfur region.ThusDarfurhas become the outcast provincewhichgoverns isolation and deprivation of development and services for this part of the country. Despite this repression, oppression and deprivation,theDarfurcitizenscontinued to ignite revolutions and uprisingsagainst the colonialsled by tribal leaders such asSultanAli Dinarin El-Fasher, SultanTajeldinin Daral-Massaleitandotheranti- Colonialization rebels.
In spite of this continuous national giving and transcendence over the bounties, the people of Darfur remained wherever they sought to express theirgrievances they suffermore injusticeby the neocolonialpolicies pursued by successiveSudanesenational regimes. The spirit of hope and the ability to make the independence a treasure have gone with the wind of denial. The so-called ‘national’ governments followed the footsteps ofthe colonial policies that were able to isolate Darfur from communicating with the rest of the country and deprived its people of the services that weresupposed to be rights rather than a grant or charity providedby thecharitablegiver.This applies to all serviceswhether in health, education or reconstruction projects. Thoseare thepolicies thatprefer one over otherscreated a difference between the sonsand the daughtersof onenation.
Darfurislocated inageographicaldistantspacewhich isveryfarawayfrom the ruling centrein Khartoum andworse it isaway fromthe mainPort of the countryin Port Sudan. This geographic reality imposes an economic dialectic that the abundant producesoftheDarfurregion aredealt with at the lowestand cheapprice and that the needs of Darfur from importsare boughtat the highest prices;thus the citizenremainsa loser in both cases. In the face of this inherited situation, the people of Darfur demanded that the varioussuccessivepoliticalregimes address this imbalance–this has been inked andquoted in the Bookauthored by the rebel Justice Equality Movement (JEM) in its book:“The blackbook:Imbalance ofPower andWealth in Sudan”.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book:_Imbalance_of_Power_and_Wealth_in_the_Sudan–
In the circumstances, the people of Sudan in the region of Darfur thought ofconstructing the road that connectsthe production sites,to the main National Port. Chiefamong themisthe westernRescueRoad.The people ofDarfur came totheirmind,thatthe central government is unlikely to contribute to such development project for Darfur andthey ended up thinking to depend on themselvesdespite theirlimited capabilities.Theydecided tohavefinancial input to the projectfrom theSugar rations allocated to Darfur, even if it led to depriving their children of them for the sake of making this way that serves Darfur and the country alike.With that resolve, the people of Darfur were able to collect large sums of money, but those who are betting that Darfur remains an area for the production ofCropsand a market for consumption and a source for cheap labourforthe centre, hence, the Sugar moneythatwascollected foundits wayintothe Northern Rescue Road to serve the population of the Northern Nilotic Region of Sudan. It was one of the reasons thatbecame the direct cause thatprovoked the youth and prompted them to take up arms.Furthermore, there wereother vitaldevelopmentprojects that have startedtoworkbuthave beencompletelycanceled, such as the Jebel MarraProject, theSavannaProject, the GhazalaJawazat Project, the HabilaProject, the BaggaraBasinWaterProject, the El Fasher cities water network project in Nyala, El Geneina and other vital projects.
Despite the advanced role that the people of Darfur played in achieving independence, such asthe burning of the English flag in the city of El Fasher, Capital of Darfur Province ina massive demonstration on February 2, 1952 AD. Unfortunately, as soon as independence was declared, the ruling political elite turned its back on Darfur, striking at it a new collar of political isolation and depriving it of the basic jobs that colonialismhasleft, which are more than eight hundred jobs as mentioned by someresearchers. Darfur did not get a single job. In addition to that, Darfur was isolated from the contribution to deliberately leading the country in the executive and legislative apparatus, as the corridors of Darfur witnessed a new pattern of isolation and blockade through what was known as the“export of deputiesof the Parliament who decided to run in the constituencies of Darfur while they had not been in the Darfur Province before,a precedentthat reflectsthe extent of the cunning mentality that ruling the country.It is also noteworthy topoint out that theFirstMinister of the sons of Darfur wastheleaderAhmed Ibrahim DereigafterEleven years of independenceof Sudanand after violent political confrontations andwhilethe firstGovernor in Darfurwas the lateEngineer Mahmoud Bashir Jamaa after twenty-five years of independence. And the first ambassador from Darfurwas Dr. Al-Tijani Fadil, afterFifty years of independence and theFirst school opened in Darfur wasFifty years after theFirstSchool opened in theCentral Regionof Sudan. These models clearly demonstrate the extent of the systematic policies that were followed in isolating the people of Darfur and depriving them of their natural right to contribute to leadingofthe country and participating in national decision-making. And it also proves that recognition of the just right of the people of Darfur is only possible after confrontations and clashes. It is truly surprising that this was not only in the past, but it is the samerightnow. To say that all the efforts made by the people of Darfur to draw the authority’s attention to the gravity of theinjusticepolicies aimed at Darfur, whetherreflectedby theuprisings orprocessions that were led by many organizations such as theSony’s Darfurian revolutionary Movementand the Red Flames, the Darfur Renaissance Front and the solidarity of the countryside and other attempts have been completely ignored andthey were consideredaskind of racism and tribalism. Thus, the situation continued to deteriorate from bad to worse until it ended intaking up Armscarryingweaponsto fight for the denied citizenship rights.
After careful consideration of the aboveisn’tit time to genuinely go beyond theoldpractices and policies that have deprived the people of Darfur to claim their legitimate rights after the glorious December19, 2018revolution?
The Operation Long Arm (OLA) comesthis very dayreflectingthe fruitsof the changes brought about by the Glorious December 19, 2018popularRevolution.Of the jokes that were recorded in those moments is thatoneof the Sudanese citizens saidcommentingduring those pivotal momentsand describing what he was seeing from a distance: “the Sudanese Justice and Equality Forces are a fierce force, quick to attack and eliminate the forces of the National Congress Party, under every moment. We ask God, our Lord, to grant them a clear victory; thosewho rule us in Sudan are nothing butrobbers at best andCorruptgangsters at their worst”!This revolution has been participated in its detonation by all components of the Sudanese people. Therefore, political groups must unite in order tomake theopportunity for the counter revolution to dismantle the achievements. This is the only way to build a new Sudan that is one of the demands of the revolution, in addition to a reform destroyed by the organs of the ousted ruling regime during the past thirty lean years.Now is the time to admit that we, as a Sudanesepeople havewasted valuable decades in absurd internal wars. Therefore we have to stop these self-destructive wars of attrition that their roots and causes had begun since August 1955, just before the dawn of the Declaration of Independence from the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium of January the First 1956.To reiterate the fact, now, with what has been achieved in Sudan after the revolution, it is the appropriate moment to achieve sustainable Peace, after the people suffered too long from the scourge of wars that continued without interruption as a result of the intransigence of the mostly military rulers of the Sudanese state since independence.
But today,the (OLA)comesat different circumstancesin Sudan. There have been far-reaching changes since then; in that thecomponents of the Sudanese people rose up and caused the Glorious Popular Revolution on the Nineteenth of December 2018 and Overthrew the ruling regime of the Masonic National Congress Party (NCP) the branch of the global Muslim Brotherhood  Movement (MBM) and removed its Tyrant President Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, the perpetrator of crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide in the Darfur region and remained fugitive from the  international justice and being chased by the International Criminal Court(ICC)  atThe Hague,inthe Netherlands, andalongwith him hiscriminal entouragewho are now inthe famousKoberPrison.At the present, the ousted Omer al-Bashir isimprisoned in a correctional facilityfor the elderly criminals,pending his delivery to the(ICC).It is also noteworthythe presence ofal-Bashir’scriminalfugitiveentourage who are currentlydetainedin Kober Prison, awaiting their handover to theInternational justiceatthe International Court in The Hague, Netherlands.Furthermore, the Sudanese Revolutionaries have managed to form Transitional Political Institutions of Sovereignty and Council of Ministers along with a Prime Minister both of which have activelyengaged withthe Armed Struggle Movements (ASM) ofSudanese Justice and Equality Movement (JEM),the Sudan Liberation Movement –Minni Minnawi (SLM-MM), Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) –Agar and others engaged in the Process with a view to reaching to a comprehensive sustainable and just Peace all over the Country inthe peace negotiations platformJuba, the Capital of South Sudan.Furthermore, some armed movement factions at the Juba peace platform thought to suggest among other peace requirements the following:
First: Achieving a just and comprehensive peace that meetsallits objective and procedural requirements in a manner consistent withtheinternationally recognized and popularly accepted standards by addressing the rootcausesof the national crisis and the causes of wars and addressing their corresponding effects.
Second: The immediate surrender of thedeposed genocidal criminal Omeral-Bashir and all those wanted with him to the International Criminal Court in order to achieve justice andwithout linking that filewith politics.
Third: To call for a national conference to resolve controversial issues related to the peace file and adopt it within the provisions of the permanent constitution.
Fourth: Halting the ongoing negotiations in Juba until the constitutional document is amended to pave the way for comprehensive peace, completing procedural shortcomings and resolving duplication between the transitional authority parties regarding the peace file.
Fifth:Issue immediate decisions by the government to establish security inthe region ofDarfur,toresolvethesecuritychaos, stop killings, looting and rape, support and reform justice agencies, and call for a security conference in Darfur in preparation for civil reconciliation.
Some historians report that on Wednesday August 28, 1963, Pastor Martin Luther KingJr. said at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington that he has a Dream and he was dreaming about seeing a future in which Blacks and Whites in America coexist freely, equality and in homogeneity. The dream of the Pastor came true on Tuesday 20 January 2009, when Barack Hussein Obama ascended the Presidential throne of the United States of America.  Equally, the dream of the people of Sudan is that the political elites who have ruled Sudan since the dawn of independence to recognize the right of the marginalized people of the Sudan to assume Sovereign positions in Sudan on an equal basis with them without discrimination.
Martin Luther King Jr. has been quoted as saying: “Injusticeanywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/injustice
