Hassan Ahmed[emailÂ protected]When the person sees daily in front of her \ his blocks every day , then way of salvation becomes not possible , because of the worst actions of government in the own country , until the simple hope to live in safe situation non existence , the basic things of human being life , for example , the right of life , freedom expression , social justice , fair elections to choose the candidate , whom you want to vote for her or him , so thatwhen the citizen , if we suppose concept of citizenship in avaible in country like Sudan , the simple person all she or he wants , avaible education for the children , and when the child will be sick , go to the hospital or clinic the doctor never dismisses her or him , because of money .Country like Sudan under Islamic regime all us feel we are not human being exactly , right of citizenship , Ihave mentioned it before , it has strong environment , the daily death in three Sudanese regions continue , under hearing of international community , the regional forces as African Union , Arab league , and united Nation is successful to issue statements of condemn , never takes affective attitudes against the Islamic regime . Concept of international ties always considers , the interests are better than right of human being in the life , we nominate this global community , it is just commission of ghosts , work for how to gain more interests only , until they people are murdering daily in their countries .Sudan at this crucial moment in its history , it is symbol of this international community , the Sudanese government always call for the comprehensive peace , but it works daily to fulfill it by military operations in Darfur the wounded , Nuba mountains lives under siege of air strikes , then Blue Nile its populations face the forcible migration .Camps of refugees and displaced people can tell you the real tales , after that the world that became small village pretends the deep sleeping , although those people of three regions , they do not know sweet of sleep , although stay in displaced Camps , the authorities of Khartoum addicted to revenge from them daily .How can we name these atrocious actions which committed by the Sudanese government since took power by military coup in 1989 , this sham regime signed many agreements in Kenya , Egypt , Qater , Nigeria , now it is searching for this invalid peace for the Sudanese peoples in Ethiopia , but we ask our selves , really the Sudanese government needs the peace or it wants to the global forces , it is with stability , then the search for the peace , it is farce theatre .We implore the international community , the peoples who loved the peace to impose decisive decisions to stop the futile wars against the African peoples in Sudan , those peoples never forget the slow of African Union in the near future .
