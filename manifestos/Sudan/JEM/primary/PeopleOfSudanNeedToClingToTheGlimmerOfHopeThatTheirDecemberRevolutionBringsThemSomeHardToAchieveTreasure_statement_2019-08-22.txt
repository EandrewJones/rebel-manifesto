People of Sudan need to cling to the glimmer of hope that their December Revolution brings them some hard to achieve treasure
By Mahmoud A. Suleiman
Getting achievements after long bitter setbacks is a laudable thing. Therefore, Let us celebrate the signing of the Constitutional Declaration. On the other hand, the demands of the revolution must be fulfilled without any equivocation. It is timely to ensure the rights of citizenship and the entitlements of women and youth both of which represent the fuel behand the victory of the 19 December 2018glorious revolution. It is a professional one that reflects the composition and diversity of all Sudanese, “not the five armies as it is now.
We affirm that the day of signing the “Constitutional Declaration” represents “the victory of the people over the fascism of multitude of nominations and the falsely called theIslamic Charter Front (ICF)/ National Islamic Front (NIF)/ that split into National Congress Party (NCP) and Popular Congress Party (PCP), the terrorist hypocritical Islamism entity. It is high time for the Sudanese people to do with the chronic marginalization they have endured over the past sixty-three lean yearsafter theindependence on January 1, 1956 from the British colonials. The National Congress Party (NCP) is an emanation of the National Islamic Front that organised the military putsch in 30th June 1989.
All the political components be it civilian or armed in Sudan must admit unreservedly to the Those affected by the tyranny of the NCP include the people of Darfur region, the Nuba Mountains, Southern Blue Nile in Ingessana, the dam areas in Kajbar, Amri and the Beja areas of eastern Sudan. Furthermore, we must not forget the southern region of Sudan where its citizens have seceded and formed their own state South Sudan as a result of the racism they suffered. The truth before the Sudanese people who rose up and made their victorious revolution should not forget the fact that Sudan will not stabilize unless democracy and peace are combined in any accord.
On Tuesday 20th August 2019 the names of the members of the Council of sovereignty in Sudan, have been officially announced headed by the General Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman al-Burhan.
Sudan’s transitional military council spokesman, Shams al-Din al-Kabbashi, announced the names of members of the sovereign council that is leading the country in the transitional period.
The Military Council issued a decree forming the Sovereignty Council, which included the military members (Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan as Chairman of the Sovereignty Council – Mohammad Hamdan Daglo “Hemetti – Shams Al-Deen Kabashi – Yasser Abdulrahman Atta – Ibrahim Jaber). This is followed by a civilian for the remainder of 18 months.
The civilians were (Hassan Mohamed Idris – Siddiq Tower Cafe – Mohammed Alfaki Suleiman – Mohammed Hassan Othman Altaaiishi – Aisha Musa Al-Saeed – Raja Nicola Issa Abdul Messie).
The President of the Sovereignty Council will take office as of Wednesday 21st August 2019 at 11 a.m. and the members of the Council before the President of the Sovereignty Council and the Chief Justice at 1:00 pm
The prime minister will be appointed on Wednesday and will be sworn in at 9 pm.
The announcement of the composition of the Council was scheduled for Sunday, coinciding with the signing of the agreement between the Transitional Military Council and the forces of freedom and change.
The Transitional Military Council issued a statement on Monday 19th August 2019 saying that they will dissolving the Transitional Military Council (TMC) and form instead a Sovereign Council which would be delayed by 48 hours at the request of the forces of freedom and change, which have been divided over their candidates.http://www.sudanile.com/index.php/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1/117672-%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%A5%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A3%D8%B9%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A6%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A9-%E2%80%9C%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%86%E2%80%9D
The (TMC) and the Forces for Declaration of Freedom and Change have not dismissed the role of women in the December 2019 revolution. Thus, the Forces of Freedom and Change and the military council agreed on the name of Nemat instead of Abdelgader Mohamed Ahmed, who was the candidate of the forces of change for the presidency of the judiciary.Nemat Abdullah was sworn in before “al-Burhan” as President of the Sudanese judiciary. It is noteworthy that the appointment of Nemat Abdullah Khair comes after considerable controversy and reports that the military council refused to accept the candidate of the forces of freedom and change for the presidency of the transitional judiciary, Mualana Abdul Gadir Muhammad Ahmad.
Dr. Suad Moustafa El Haj Mousa, one of the women representatives, believes that the share of women in the Sovereign Council is very small if we consider the great role played by the Sudanese women in the December Revolution. Dr. Suad advocates the inevitable right of equal rights for women and men, but positive gender discrimination in favor of women is a high priority given the fact that the Sudanese women being the pioneers of the house and the impulses of the home. But what happened to the Sudanese woman after a long wait for the throes of the revolution, which oversaw the birth of her fetus by the Forces of the Declaration of Freedom and Change has made women to question as to what was going on inside the chambers and debate corridors   between the Forces of the Declaration of Freedom and Change aka (GHT) and the Transitional Military Council (TMC) junta, but there was no clear indication of the fate of women’s participation and representation in transitional government institutions.In her letter, the voice of women representative, Dr. Suad Mustafa al-Hajj, says that it is wise and necessary to link the job to the effectiveness of the chosen personality, both cognitively and practically, on issues of women and society, not only the women of the National Capital Khartoum or what is known as the cities and thecursedhateful Hamdi Triangle, but the women of the marginalized regions of Sudan as a whole.
Having red and listened to the foregoing, one will reflect fairly on the Strong and plausible arguments presented by the Spokesman of the Sudanese Marginalized regionsto Dr. Jaafar Mohammadain who said that they would reject the interim agreement reached to by the Forces for Declaration of Freedom and Change (FFC) and the Transitional Military Council (TMC) for some reasons he has so far presented. He said their rejection is based on the fact that the agreement does not explicitly include the issues of war and peace in Sudan, and does not discuss the issues of those who committed crimes against the Sudanese citizens in the margin in general nor did the agreement include how to restore and compensate those affected by the absurd wars triggered by the National Congress Party (NCP) regime. Furthermore, Dr. Mohammadain also indicated that those who took up arms and struggled and fought the regime for more than thirty years have been excluded, which means the reproduction of the same state ruled by the Northern River Nile elites, who have ruled Sudan since the independence from the Colonial Anglo-Egyptian Condominium and now want to preserve their privileges. Therefore, our response was to reject the agreement based on the issues of our people in the margin, who were marginalized and excluded clearly, he continued saying. When asked by the Sputnik TV channel presenter said that the signing of the Constitutional Declaration was agreed by broad base of people who celebrated so what do you tell them? His answer was prompt: “We say to those who danced and cheered the agreement: Congratulations to you, but the people of the margin will continue our struggle until our rights are resolved to the satisfaction of all the people of the wide margin, who took up arms for years and fought the regime until weakened, until the popular revolution uprooted the regime of the Génocidaire Omer al-Bashir.
On the other hand, newspaper outlets reported that the leader of the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) andDeputy Chairman of the Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF) Dr. Gibril Ibrahim Mohammed told the electronic newspaper Alrakoba and said: “We will oppose the agreement, the government that forms it, and that the Forces of Declaring of Freedom and Change have falsified the will of the people and abducted their efforts.

The feelings of injustice and grievances continues non-stop over the Quotas in the Sovereign Council and the rest of the post-revolutionary institutions. The highest voices of protest come from the components of the armed forces of the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), the Sudan Liberation Movement-Army of  Minni Minnawi wing and the Sudan Liberation Movement-Army Abdel Wahid Mohamed Ahmed Al-Nour wing and the SPLM north and all the components of the Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF), in response to  not being  included  the quotas as representatives of the regions affected by wars without attaining any peace in the priorities after the December 2018 revolution in which all components of the Sudanese people participated until the success of removing the nightmare and dictatorship that delayed the development of Sudan for lean thirty years and displaced millions of citizens from their homes and lands, along with  driving the separation of southern Sudan and making Sudan’s Presidency to become a pariah chased by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague in the Netherlands and remained a fugitive from internarial justice. Of irony of fate Omer al- Bashir is now detained on trial in a Court of Law in the Sudanese Capital Khartoum because of storing millions of US dollars in his private home; charged of financial corruption crimes.The foregoing is something that has never thought of by any Sudanese individual to happen at any time in Sudan. Omer al-Bashir is being tried in public during the daylight in the Capital Khartoum – the Den of the National Congress Party (NCP)Islamism regime! This is in addition to the presence of Influential members of the entourage of Omer al-Bashir, such asthe former First Vice PresidentAli Osman Mohamed Taha,and the assistant of the deposed President Nafie Ali Nafie,former Speaker of Parliament, Ahmed Ibrahim Al-Taher, former Defense Minister Abdel Rahim Mohamed Hussein, the former Khartoum Governor Abdul Rahman al-Khidir and the First Vice President Bakri Mohamed Saleh and the list goes on in detention waiting to be brought to trial for the crimes they have perpetrated and they are held in Kober Central Prison in the Capital Khartoum.  And this is along with the detention of the famous businessman and former president of Mars Football Club, Jamal al-Wali. The country’s most famous businessman, Abdul Basit Hamza, and businessman Jamal Zamgan were also among the detainees.

Furthermore, an informed source confirmed that the number of detainees was 24 and that the supervision of the detention center in Kober prison became the jurisdiction of the police and not the security apparatus as it was previously.
It is known fact that the former President Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir who ruled Sudan with an iron fist was ousted held in the famous Kober Prison in Khartoum days after he was deposed on Thursday April 11, 2019, following continuous popular protests since Wednesday the 19th December 2018 of last year. The army formed a Transitional Military Council (TMC) after al-Bashir was sacked. The military Junta – aka (TMC) – has limited its rule to two years amid attempts to reach an understanding with the parties and opposition forces on the management of the next phase.https://euroabia.com/انباء–عن–مغادرة–الرئيس–السوداني–المعز/
Of the signs of achieving some of the objectives of the December 2018 Revolution of the people of Sudan include the speech of the President of the Ombudsman of Sudan who told us about Scourges in state institutions and his seizure of funds and real estate owned by the family of the Deposed Omer al-Bashir and Nafie Ali Nafiethat have been documentedby Saeed Salama in the newspaper صحيفة يورابيا Euroabia.https://euroabia.com/%d8%b1%d8%a6%d9%8a%d8%b3-%d8%af%d9%8a%d9%88%d8%a7%d9%86-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85-%d9%81%d9%8a-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%af%d8%a7%d9%86-%d9%8a%d8%aa%d8%ad%d8%af%d8%ab-%d8%a8%d9%84/

Some components of the opposition, which are not included in the quotas of the Sovereign Council, say that the Forces of the Declaration of Freedom and Change, which is referred to as the word “Gaht” for short as the penultimate version of the former Deep State.
In spite of criticism of the FDC and the Transitional Military Council, some observers, along with political analysts, believe that the 19th December 2018 revolution is a big thing and contains a glimmer of hope that should be upheld because the time to achieve all and everything is not yet at hand and cannot be achieved in a short period especially with the destruction caused by the Demolition pick of the ruling National Congress Party regime over the past 30 years.
One of the many positive outcomes of the popular December the 19th 2018 Sudanese Revolution is that Abdullah Adam Hamdouk, who is one of the most competent personalities to take the post of the Prime Minister of the Council of Ministers of Sudan. He has no previous relationship to the lean years that ruled by the putschist dictators and therefore people need to stick to the positive outcomes and hold on the achievements with all their might.
At the same time, we have to admit that the peace demands in the war-affected areas are a fair and exhaustive war and deserve to be given their share first because the conditions in the displacement and asylum camps are very poor. As we know that the fate of the prisoners of war belonging to the Justice and Equality Movement of Sudan did not know until this moment, which continued to haunt their families and let you bear the responsibility of the presidency of the armed struggle movements where The prisoners’ relatives thought That prisoners of war are silenced and no one gives any attention to them.
