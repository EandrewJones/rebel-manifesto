Press Statement from the Spokesperson of JEM
Justice & Equality Movement Sudan (JEM) noticed, in the last couple of days, a false news piece claiming that JEM forces are blocking the road between Sabha and the southern parts of Libya. Against this fake news, JEM would like to state the following:
1- JEM categorically denies any presence in Sabha or any part of Libya. Since JEM is not there it cannot block roads.2- The Conflict in Libya is an internal affair of the Libyans and JEM is not and will not be party to it.3- Some parties to the conflict in Libya kept erroneously and irresponsibly accusing JEM with interference in their internal affairs without doing a minimum due diligence to know who is who. The mainstream JEM led by Dr. Gibril Ibrahim has nothing to do with the internal fighting between Libyan factions.4- Parties to the conflict in Libya are earnestly requested to stop this evil propaganda and exert some effort to identify their true adversary instead of blaming an innocent party due to misinformation, disinformation or impersonation.
