Putting Peace in the rear after the Sudanese Revolution isAkin to puttingtheCartbefore the Horse
By Mahmoud A. Suleiman
This article comes against the backdrop of theindifference and the Tortoisesluggishness/Turtle decelerationof thePeace file, which is one of the elements of the chants of the December 19, 2018Glorious Popular Sudanese Revolutionwhich was calling for Freedom, Peace and Justice until it toppled the Deposed President, who is now in a correctional Reformatory/Institution facilityfor the elderly as a result of possessing looted people’s money in hishouse.It is almost  two years on the row since the Revolutionary Sudanese public chanted for triple Slogans of Freedom -Peace – Justice.
Thus, puttingPeace in the rear after theRevolution is like putting a cart in front of the Horseapplies to the situation in Sudandominated by the Forces for Declaring Freedom and Change (FFC); the group that tries to steal the sacrifices and rights of the Sudanese people and give them to themselves, excluding the real stakeholders.
As is known in advance and may not need to be repeated, except that it is just for reminding that theconstruction of the house does not take place beforelaying thefoundation. And this seems to be happening in Sudanthat doesnotputPeace as a basis for the requirements of the glorious19thDecember2018 Revolution.Andthe foregoing statementdoessquarelycoincideand tallieswith theactions of the Forces ofDeclaringFreedomandChange/Arabic GAHT.Thisseems asa questionthatawaits the logical answer!This is meant to guarantee thatthe cart may not be placed in front of the horseanymore.Some of the paragraphs of this article may be seena bit harshby the readers, but that is aneffectofthe anger associated with frustrations as a result of the systematic slowdown towards achieving a just and sustainable peace in Sudan.

The major issues in Sudan during the thirty odd years ofthearbitrary rule ofthe Muslim Brotherhood Movement (MBM)regimewith itsmultitude nomenclatures ofSudan include among many:
As it is well recognised fact andUnderInternational humanitarian norms, Peacecomesassociated with efforts as tohow tostopthewars andas well as toHow to address the causes of warsand find effective ways to meet the needs of theInternallydisplacedpersons (IDPs)andtherefugeesin the neighbouring countries, as well asfindingthe numbers and places of prisoners of warand addressingtheir needs, and how to release them andto howtheirrelease to be determined. These foregoingessentialissues have yet to be addressed by the group continued dominating the mass media,under the rubric name ofthe Forces for Declaring Freedom and Change (FFC).The (FFC)seems deliberatelydoesn’tgive a fig about Peace.It is instead, racing for Quotas for the jobs of the State Governors who are not of a priority over Peace.This attitude is contrary to what was agreed in the Juba, the capital of the government of South Sudan.Following the systematic delays in the matters related to Peace,The JEM has threatened to stop negotiations with the transitional government if the prisoners’ file is not addressed and reveal the fate of the missing.
It has been reported that the Movements ofArmedStruggle, including the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM)has threatened to stop negotiations with the transitional government if the prisoners’Of War (POW)file is not addressed and the fate of themissingindividualsrevealed.
The Prisoners of War (POWs) file Official in the (JEM)accused the Prosecutor Al-Fatih Tayfour, of Procrastinating and dodging the release of the prisoners of War (POWs) and impeding the process of reaching the Peace Agreement. Furthermore, it has been reported that (JEM) has threatened to stop negotiations with the transitional government if the prisoners’ file is not addressed and reveal the fate of the missing.https://www.sudanakhbar.com/652812

They also say that peace and war, despite their moral dimension, are actually close at the end of the day, as the battles end on their ferocity, to start peace negotiations between the opponents of yesterday to end the scourge of war, to return to what was destroyed by the war as much as possible by the presence of the parties with facilitators, mediators and observers from the neighboring countries of Sudan. In the African Union in addition to the United Nations and the Organization of the League of Arab States
At this stage it is worthwhile to explore as to how Address Scourges of War. At this curve, it became worth noting that the readers are reminded of the book of war and peace by the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy, which is a novel book that contains the factors and effects of war and on how to deal with the scourge of war through peace.https://ar.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8_%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85

Building social peace in Darfur and in all Sudan will be a critical step to get rid of this sinister legacy of the 30 year arbitrary rule of the deposed National Congress Party (NCP).The foregoing statement comes following the grave catastrophic events that took place in the western Darfur State of Geneina, capital of the Massalit Tribal group when Death and despair surrounded the people of West Darfur on New Year’s Day. In the wake of intensified clashes between Arab and non-Arab elements of the Masalit groups, coinciding with the end of the previous year 2019, when thousands of residents of El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur, and the internally displaced persons (IDPs)  from camps for internally displaced persons located in the vicinity of the fighting, fled. Many of them crossed the border into the neighboring Republic of Chad in search ofsafety, while thousands of others joined their dispersed families across Darfur.https://www.sudantribune.net/%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%82%D9%81%D9%88%D8%A7-%D9%86%D8%B2%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%81%D9%88%D8%B1
Inthat catastrophicescalationof indiscriminate killings, the twotribalsides reported killing at least 70 people and wounding dozens of others. According to the Masalit leader, armed fighters in tribal outfit driven by tribal considerations raided theKerindingcamp, setting houses on fire, and killing about fifty displaced people,forcing the survivors to flee.
SuleimanBaldo, the renownedAuthorat The Enough Project writing in the Sudan Tribune wrote a painful article about the killings of one country citizens as a result of the lack of peace. His article entitled: “Stopthe Darfur bleeding”!https://www.sudantribune.net/%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%82%D9%81%D9%88%D8%A7-%D9%86%D8%B2%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%81%D9%88%D8%B1
And the result of the negativeaspectsthat accompanyingthe delay in deciding on the peace file, theJustice and Equality Movement (JEM)hasrecentlythreatened to stop negotiations with the transitional government if the prisoners’ file is not addressed and revealedthe fate of the missing.https://www.alalamtv.net/news/4672966/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86–%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9-%D8%A7–%D9%84–%D8%AF—%D9%81-%D8%A7–%D9%88%D8%B6
Perhaps peoplemightremember thebattle of GozDungoin the state of South Darfur, which took place between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Justice and Equality Movement(JEM),the combatant in the Darfur region in April 2015, and that battle left large numbers of prisonersof war (POWs), who numbered more than 300 fighters from the ranks of the Justice and Equality Movement. They were arrested by government forces after the battle, whichal-Bashir, at the timesaidhehad resolvedthe battleby the RSF in half an hour.https://3ayin.com/%D9%82%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%82%D9%88-%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%89-%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%84-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%A9/

And questions will come up posing themselves in the form of one question after another about peace, as to whether the next time we will be repeating the slogans of the December Revolution on and on saying:“And so that the wholeSudanesecountrybecomesDarfurandgets burntbythemilitia fire,in the form ofkilling, terrorizing, displacement and drowning in the pools of blood as it happened in the city of El Geneinain western Darfur,the .Therefore and to avoid that happeningTransitional Sovereignty CouncilandtheCouncil of Ministers must issue an immediate decision to disarm all militias, and establish a deterrent law on crimes committed against citizens, and the formation ofregularforces and patrols guarding of the displacement camps, until the displacement problem is fully resolved.The foregoing wishful statement will unlikely happen unless Peace becomes the Priority for both the Government and the group in the Forces for Declaration of Freedom (FDF).It isneither unacceptablenorlogical that there are no regular forces capable of preventing whathas beenhappening these days in the Nuba Mountains and in the Eastern Sudan.
And so that the whole country does not becomelikeDarfur, the transitional government must respect the blood of the Sudanese people in Darfur, and change its way of dealing with the cold and very slow with such events, because if these massacres were in other places close to the centre (Khartoum), the situation would be completelydifferent.
And so that the whole country does not become Darfur, the resistance committees in all parts of the country must be vigilant to monitor and follow up all who have a relationship with the hidingShadow Brigades of Ali Osman Tahaand thwart their plans in the bud.
And so that the whole country does not become Darfur, the wise and wise of the social entities must play their effective role in curbing the foolish people of their children, spreading a culture of peace, accepting the other, resorting to the voice of the law and not resorting to restoring rights in (Bonnet) whatever the motives and justifications.
Otherwise, those fires that have been on fire will not stop until they work – God forbid – all parts of the country.
Then the whole country will become Darfur in the bloody sense.
The whole country will become a camp like ahotel,the entire country is Jebel Marra, the whole el-Fasher country, and the whole country the garden.

Walt Whitman the American poet, essayist, journalist and humanist, who was a part of the transition between transcendentalism and realism, incorporating both views in his works and was among the most influential poets in the American canon, often called the father of free verse, has been quoted as saying:“Peace is always beautiful”.

What is required in Sudanatpresentfrom the revolution government with its multi-faceted components without procrastination to go into the peace file and work to pay its dues and devote itself to other major files represented in improving the lives of citizens as much as possible while providing security on the basis that they are the causes of stability and securing people from fear And hunger.The foregoingitemsobviouslyneed money, which is the backbone of life through production and communication with global financial systems.
Of courseWith regard to removing the name of Sudan from the list of countries that supportand sponsor terrorism along with work hard with Especially the United States of America and in addition to seeking to write off the accumulated debts on Sudan by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund(IMF).In 2018 Sudan public debt was 61,535 million euros 72,673 million dollars, has decreased 488 million since 2017.
