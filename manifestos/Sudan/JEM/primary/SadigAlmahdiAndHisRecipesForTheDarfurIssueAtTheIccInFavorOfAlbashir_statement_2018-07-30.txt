SadigAlmahdiand his Recipes for the Darfur Issue at the ICCin FavorofalBashirBy Mahmoud A.

However, at this juncture, Mr. al-Mahdi has lifted the lid and opened the Pandora’s jartheartifact intheGreek mythology.In that he suggested some alternatives such as the Convention of the Democratic South Africa (CODESA) to replace the (ICC) indictment of Omer al-Bashir.The importantargument tothatsuggestion is thatthere is no parity in comparing what happened in the Apartheid South Africaandwhat happenedto the Sudanese citizens inthe region of Darfur in the Western Sudan of crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. Moreover, it is high time to categorically refute the falsehood propagandaandclaims of the African Union (AU) entity that the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague only persecute and unfairly targets African Politicians.
