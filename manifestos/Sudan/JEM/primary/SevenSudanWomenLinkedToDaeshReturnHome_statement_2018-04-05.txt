Repatriation came after Libyan security authorities found them in the coastal city of Sirte
Cairo: Ten young Sudanese nationals linked to the terrorist Daesh group had returned late Wednesday from neighbouring Libya, a Sudanese security official has said.
The returnees included seven women, two children and a man, Brigadier Al Tijani Ebrahim, an official in the Sudanese anti-terrorism agency, added at a press conference.
They were flown home aboard a Turkish airway flight that arrived at the Khartoum airport late Wednesday.
Ebrahim said that the returnees will attend ideological courses in order to determine the motives that prompted them to join the militant group.
The repatriation of the 10 people came in coordination with Libyan security authorities after they had been found in the coastal city of Sirte, a former Daesh stronghold in Libya, according to the official.
In 2015, the Sudanese Interior Ministry estimated that around 70 Sudanese citizens had joined Daesh in Libya and Syria, although the figure is believed to be far higher.
“The [anti-terrorism] agency has received directives from presidency to retrieve all Sudanese from battlefields in Syria and Libya,” Ebrahim said.
Two of the 10 returnees included twins Manar and Abrar Abdul Salam, who are believed to have left Khartum in August 2015 aboard a flight heading to Istanbul via Sharjah.
Daesh terrorists have in recent months suffered military setbacks in Libya, Syria and Iraq where they once declared a self-styled Islamic caliphate.
