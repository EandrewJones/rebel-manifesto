CALL FOR BIG DEMONSTRATIONs AGAINST GOVERNMENTAL GERMAN-SUDANESE COLLABORATION AGAINST VICTIMS OF WAR AND GENOCIDE IN SUDAN
Saturday: 26th January 2013 Berlin.Tuesday: 29th January 2013, Berlin.
In 29th January 2013, German Ministry of Foreign Affairs will host a conference to organize a financial support to Sudanese government and its president Omar Al-bashir. The conference will be held in Berlin, the Sudanese Foreign affairs minister will be there.By this Germany obviously takes part in killing and torturing Sudanese people, all over Sudan.
The Sudanese president Omar Al-bashir is a criminal wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) according to the warrants of arrest No (ICC-02/05-01/09) issued in 4 March 2009, and (ICC-02/05-01/09) issued in 12 July 2010, for Genocide, war crimes and crimes against Humanity in Darfur region west Sudan.  Not only that, also, the Sudanese minister of defense also a wanted criminal by ICC.  And we can say Sudan is governed now by a group of criminals, as there are about 51 suspects in Darfur case in front of International Criminal court, most of them are men of power in Sudan government which is strongly supported by German government.
70 – 80% of the annual Sudanese national budget goes to Omar Al-bashir Militias to kill children, students at Universities, rape women, displace families, and to bomb civilians in Darfur, Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile states, and to torture and violate human rights of journalists, social workers and peaceful demonstrators in Khartoum and all the others Sudanese States.
Sudan government is a very well known Islamic terrorist group, supporting the idea of killing of non-Muslims including German people (according to their mad views), here (by this conference), Germany is providing Sudan government with the financial capacity needed to fund its terrorism doings such as attacking and burning embassies and consulates in Khartoum, just like what happened last year for German embassy itself.
We, Sudanese community and Refugees in Germany together with our supporters and all freedom, justice and equality fighters, condom, denounce and reject this conference which is hosted by the Ministry of Foreign affairs, Berlin, Germany in 29th Jan 2013, and we recognize and define it as a crime against humanity, it is a crime (Ethically, politically and legally), and we will stand strongly against it, and against those who are behind this here in Germany by any means, legally and politically.
