War and famine. Peace and milk. — Somali proverbIntroductionRichard Kaufman
Welcome to this session on the economics of regime change. I want to say just a few words before our panelists make their presentations, to set the table, so to speak, for their commentaries.Regime change occurs whenever one regime is replaced by another, an ancient dynamic in the history of nationstates.It can occur through conquest of one state over another; or political or economic pressure by a foreign power; or it can be the result of an internal set of forces: an upheaval, a coup d’état, a revolution, a civil war, or a collapse and self-renewal of a state.
