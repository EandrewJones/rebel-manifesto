Some armed factions stand as a stumbling block against the path to the peace process
By Mahmoud A. Suleiman
Barricades and Stumbling Blocks are delaying the Sudanese Peace Process in Juba.
It is regrettable thatsome Armed struggle movement factions stand as a stumbling blocks against the path to the peace process for Sudan. Having said that, one will start by asking himself as to how can the peace process in Sudan bepushed forward in the presence of barricades against itmade by those who demand peace?It is appalling that some factions of thearmed struggle movements who turned semi-pirates stand as a stumbling block against the path to peace.Thus, theBarricades and Stumbling Blockshave been created by the aggressively selfishand theself-centeredare delaying the Sudanese Peace Process in Juba, the South Sudan Capital.
The foregoing title of this article comes against the backdrop of the Major General Yassin Ibrahim Abdel Ghani, the Governor of Blue Nile State, called on all the Armed Struggle Movements and the Peoples Liberation Movement (SPLM) -Abdul Aziz Al-Hilo wing in particular, to push the peace process forward in order to reach a comprehensive and sustainable peace, stressing that the negotiating parties are serious in the peace process, and that they are making appreciable efforts had it not for  the emergence of the Coronavirus pandemic and the measures taken to cut the peace file’sadvancingsteps.And I say at this juncture as to how the shadow goes straight while the oud is bent and crooked?!
Unfortunately, the battles between the components of the armed struggle movements in the Juba peace platform in the State of Southern Sudan are evidence of the continuous setbacks against the aspirations of the internally displaced people (IDPs) and refugees from the states that suffered from the wars of attrition for so long.The aforementioned battles between the Armed Struggle Movementsagainsteach otherat one hands,and worst comes during whichthearmed struggleMovement fightingbetween each other, and in addition to the wars within each movement against its elements,the examplesarecountessas followsshown by The Headline Titles of the Newspapers:
The battles between the components of the armed struggle movements in the platform of Juba stoodasstumbling block in the way of peace which was and still is the slogan for the glorious December revolution of the people of Sudan.
The battles between the components of the armed struggle movements in the platform of Juba stood in the way of peace, which was and still is the slogan for the glorious December revolution of the people of Sudan.The battles between the armed struggle movements in the peace platform in Juba, the capital ofSouth Sudan, aremore fierce andstronger than the war against the enemy.It is the unfortunate truth that deserves condemnation in the most severeand harshterms.This isbecause it clearly seems a major betrayal of the central issue for which the revolutionaries took up arms against the deposed dictator Omer al-Bashir.
The FollowingHeadlines intheSudanese newspapers show what is going on between the armed struggle movements especially those affiliated to the Darfur Region: in the PeacePlatform in Juba, theCapital ofthe SouthSudan:
Thus, the components of the Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF) count them all, but their hearts are different, as the saying goes, and the hidden battle revolves between them, unabatedly.
One will say: “How today’s events in the peace platform of Juba are similar to the peace process in Abujathe Capital of Nigeria in where the 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement, also known as the Abuja Agreement, was signed on May 5, 2006 by the government of Sudan headed by Omer al-Bashir delegation along with a faction of the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) led by Minni Arko Minnawi. However, the agreement was rejected by two other, thought smaller groups at the time, the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and a rival faction of the SLA led by Abdul Wahid al Nur. So today seems to echoyesterday?!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur_Peace_Agreement
The current position that has been taken by some rebel movement leaders from the Darfur region seems to rally and also repeating the infamousDoha Agreementin2011.
The 2011 Darfur Peace Agreement, also known as the Doha Agreement, was signed in July 2011 between the government of Sudan and theLiberation and Justice Movement. This agreement established a compensation fund for victims of the Darfur conflict, allowed the President of Sudan to appoint a Vice-President from Darfur, and established a newDarfur Regional Authorityto oversee the region until areferendumcan determine its permanent status within the Republic of Sudan.[8]The agreement also provided for power sharing at the national level: movements that sign the agreement will be entitled to nominate two ministers and two four ministers of state at the federal level and will be able to nominate 20 members to the national legislature. The movements will be entitled to nominate two state governors in the Darfur region. However, thesignificantthing thatwas achievedwas the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD)and the result was almost nothing more than some political jobs as members within the infamous National Congress Party (NCP).https://unamid.unmissions.org/doha-document-peace-darfur
What really saddeningis thatthe Darfuri armed factions continuedNotto take lessons andexperiences fromtheirpast mistakes.
It seems clear that some movements of the armed struggle did not take lessons from their past behaviors that led them to the terrible political failure and they frustrated failed the expectations of their constituents who were expecting more achievements in their favour, but they were disappointed and tasted all the bitterness that affected them from the dictatorial regime led by the deposed criminal génocidaire, who is currently remains imprisoned in the sanatorium for the elderly criminals of his ilk. Furthermore, what should we call those who do not learn from their previous failures that have harmed their constituents? The immediately available answer is that they are the most valuable benefactors for their masters of grace and they love to   slaves and servants and not in any way the masters!
And once again some factions of the Sudanese Revolutionary Front stood as an obstacle to the peace process in Juba to repeat the revolving conflict in Darfur. One sees no justification for withdrawal from the Sudanese Revolutionary Front at this pivotal point in peace negotiations, let alone attempting to set up a separate faction in expectation of being chosen by the peace platform as the unchallenged very important person of Sudan. The SRF seemed to have no more options in the circumstance but endorsing the withdrawal of one of its members, from the alliance, who chose to do so. The Sudanese citizens in the Darfur region had enough suffering over the past lean years and continuing to suffer the after effects of genocide and would not expect such situation to happen.
It is not the time to break away from the herd, as they say.Nobody hasenvisaged anyonefrom thegroup of the armed struggleMovementsto obstruct the peace process, one of the three main slogans of the Popular Glorious December 19, 2018 Revolution that ousted theGenocidalcriminalDictator al-Bashir and his criminalentourage:“Freedom, Peace and Justice”.This is anact that cannot defended and nothing but a fateful defect.
