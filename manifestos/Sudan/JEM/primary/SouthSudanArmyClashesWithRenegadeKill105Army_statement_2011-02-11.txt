South Sudan army clashes with renegade kill 105-army* South army updates death toll to 105
* South Sudan to become independent in July
JUBA, Sudan, Feb 11 (Reuters) – Deadly clashes between south Sudan’s army and a renegade commander have killed 105 fighters and civilians, the army said on Friday, as the war-scarred region moves towards independence.
The violence comes days after results of a referendum on secession confirmed south Sudan would declare independence in July, after decades of civil war which claimed 2 million lives.
The region’s army said clashes at Fangak in Jonglei state on Feb. 9 and 10 had killed 50 fighters from both sides and 39 civilians, adding to the 16 casualties it reported a day earlier from fighting in Door.
“It was George Athor’s men who came with machine guns, AK 47s and started firing,” said south Sudan’s army spokesman Philip Aguer.
Athor was a former senior army officer who rebelled, accusing the south’s ruling party of fraud during April 2010 elections. He signed a ceasefire in January after Juba declared an amnesty for all militia commanders.
Athor blamed the southern army for starting the clashes in Jonglei state, where French oil giant Total had been due to begin exploration in April. But both sides said they were still open to talks.
“We are still committed to reconciliation and the amnesty still holds until now,” Aguer added.
The violence adds to fears of instability in the region after a south Sudan minister was shot dead in his Juba office on Wednesday. (Reporting by Jeremy Clarke, Writing by Opheera McDoom)
