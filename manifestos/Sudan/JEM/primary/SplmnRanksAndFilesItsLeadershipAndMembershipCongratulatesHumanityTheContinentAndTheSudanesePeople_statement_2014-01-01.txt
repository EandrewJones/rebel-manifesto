SPLM/N ranks and files, its leadership and membership congratulates humanity, the continent and the Sudanese people, we wish them all a better and happy new year. We are determined as ever to put the SPLM/N as a solid political reality in the Sudanese political landscape, a force that would work genuinely for change, democratization and liberation. A force that will always be learning from its own mistakes, critical of its own experience and ready to take into account the new realities and make a new beginning and re-brand itself.
The good news is that the vision of the new Sudan is still the only game in town for correct nation building, social justice and respect of human rights and re-uniting Sudans on new parameters, unity between two independent countries, a “Sudan Union” without belittling the full independence of the republic of South Sudan and on free-will of its own people in both the two republics. We wish the best in the 2014 for the peoples of the republic of Sudan and the republic of South Sudan. For my friends on Facebook, from across the world, a very happy new year to everyone of you full of joy, peace and prosperity.
