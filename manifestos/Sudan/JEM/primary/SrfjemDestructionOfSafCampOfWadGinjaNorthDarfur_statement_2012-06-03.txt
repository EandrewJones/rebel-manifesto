SRF/JEM: Destruction of SAF Camp of Wad Ginja, North DarfurA Military statement
June 4: Our gallant forces of the Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF), JEM Branch successfully removed SAF Military Garrison of Wag Ginja, North Darfur, yesterday June 2nd 2012.
The SRF-JEM seized15 armoured and transport vehicles.  JEM lost three soldiers in the operation.
SAF statement that it had repulsed attack by SRF-JEM at Futaha, near their fallen garrison of Wad Ginja is simply false and is aimed at restoring the low morale of its own army.
Four days ago, our boys intercepted a small force belonging to Khartoum’s Popular Defence Force (PDF) known locally as Abu Taira at Kordofan-Darfur Border.  The PDF unit lost its entire force of six vehicles together with their commander.  The SRF-JEM sustained no human or material loss in the action.
