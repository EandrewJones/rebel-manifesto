Sudan’s security services have established a new “Electronic Jihad” unit whose mission is to hack and bring down websites belonging to Sudanese opposition groups.
The unit’s budget is reportedly $3 million.
Nafi’ ‘Ali Nafi’, senior advisor to Sudan President Omar Al-Bashir, recently met with the unit’s staff, and told them that Al-Bashir is personally interested in their work. He instructed them to step up their actions to bring down opposition websites.
The unit will work with local communication companies to block internet service where necessary, and will also have the assistance of companies that specialize in hacking in order to carry out its mission.
