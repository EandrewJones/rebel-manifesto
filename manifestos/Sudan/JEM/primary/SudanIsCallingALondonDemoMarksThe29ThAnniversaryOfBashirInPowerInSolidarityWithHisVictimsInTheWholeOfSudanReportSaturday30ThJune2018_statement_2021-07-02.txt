Sudan is Calling –a London Demo Marks the 29th Anniversary of Bashir in Power, in Solidarity with his Victims in the Whole of Sudan – Report (Saturday, 30th June 2018)
By Osama Mahmoud
After a series of systematic, hideous crimes committed by the pro-government militias against the people of Sudan in Darfur, and in particular over the last few weeks when a number of casualties were reported between dead and injured in Gar Sela, West DARFUR, (as well as the victims of political imprisonment, oppression and human rights abuse), the Sudanese diaspora in the United Kingdom and friends of Sudan descended to London to join a peaceful demonstration on Saturday the 30th June 2018, in front of the Sudanese Embassy. The demo was organised by a collective of organisations including Civil society organisations, Waging Peace, Hart and Darfur Union in the United Kingdom and The Voice of Darfur Women. The crowds were diverse, and their coming together reflected the concerned shared by all because of the latest escalations of violence against the innocents in Sudan.
The masses were keen to make their voices heard; the following slogans were repeated throughout the day:-
Al-Bashir to ICC
Stop the war in Darfur
Stop the war in Nuba Mountains
Stop the war in Blue Nile
Justice Justice For Sudan,
Peace Peace for Sudan
All criminals to ICC
End the Genocide Now
UK Action Action now
New Sudan Free Sudan
The crowds then moved in a peaceful march from the Embassy of Sudan to the square opposite to 10 Downing Street, where representatives from following organisations (the Darfur Union in the UK (Elsadeg A. Elnor – Chairman of DU), East Sudan Community, Sudanese Professional Associations, Sudanese Women’s Rights Defenders, Waging Peace (Sonja Miley) and HART (Baroness Caroline Cox)) handed in a letter to number 10. The letter detailed the second wave of war crimes inflected upon the people of Darfur and Nuba mountains and Blue Nile.

Tremendous efforts put together by Waging Peace (ref. 3) and Hart (ref. 4) organisations to ensure that all is in place for this demo; a massive thanks to both organisations.
It is worth noting that similar demonstrations took place in the US, Germany and other countries around the globe.
