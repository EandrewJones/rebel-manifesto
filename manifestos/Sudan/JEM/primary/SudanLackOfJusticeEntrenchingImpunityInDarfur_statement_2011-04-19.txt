NAIROBI, 18 April 2011 (IRIN) – Aid workers have raised serious concerns  about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Sudan’s troubled  Darfur region where, they say, a prevailing climate of impunity has  often resulted in humanitarians being killed, injured, abducted or  car-jacked.
“There have been very few successful investigations of criminality  against aid agencies, and understandably this has only encouraged  greater caution and aversion to risk in the conduct of humanitarian  activities,” Aly Verjee, senior researcher at Rift Valley Institute,  told IRIN.
As a result, humanitarian space has been affected as organizations  do only what is most necessary, for fear that anything more will  increase the danger to staff, risk damaging ongoing essential activities  and signal to the authorities unwelcome ambitions to do more, Verjee  added.
The latest incident against aid workers was resolved on 13 April  when the African Union-UN Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), the UN Office for  the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and camp leaders  successfully mediated the release of 12 Sudanese aid workers who had  been taken hostage by a youth group at Kalma camp for the internally  displaced in South Darfur.The aid workers had been conducting a vaccination campaign and were  taken hostage in retaliation for the arrest, four days earlier, of an  IDP who worked for a national NGO.
“We cannot understand whether crimes against UN and NGO workers areorchestrated to reduce the range of our activities or if they are a  result of banditry and getting concessions from whoever wishes to pay,” a  UN worker, who requested anonymity, told IRIN. “However, the lack of  prosecution indirectly leads to a further reduction of humanitarian  space, which is already quite small in Darfur due to government’s  imposed security restrictions to conflict-affected areas.“We are afraid if we push into areas we are not allowed to reach we  could be targeted. But if the level of risk for humanitarian security  becomes too high, how long can we resist till we are forced to  withdraw?”
Impossible choices
Abby Stoddard, co-author of the 2009 study, Providing Aid in Insecure Environments,  notes that “aid workers in the most dangerous settings face few options. In places like Sudan [Darfur], Somalia and Afghanistan, the  choice boils down to reducing or withdrawing essential aid from needy  populations, or running intolerable risks to the lives of staff and  partners.”

According to the study, attacks have increased sharply since 2006  and Sudan, Afghanistan, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Chad, Iraq and Pakistan top  the list of the most violent contexts for aid work.An OCHA report published on 12 April 2011, Stay and Deliver, highlights Darfur as  “hosting numerous and fragmented armed non-state actors and criminal  bands that operate with impunity in parts of the vast region beyond the  reach of any official or security presence”.However, despite being ranked second in the World Security Database’s  incident statistics against aid workers between 2005 and 2010, UNAMID  sources said attacks against staff declined in 2010, compared with 2009.  This year, some 16 UNAMID peacekeepers have been killed and at least 80  injured.Since March 2009, armed groups in Darfur have kidnapped 30 aid  workers, all of whom have been released, with the exception of three  Bulgarian air crew, contracted by the UN World Food Programme and seized  in January 2011.“NGOs have their own security system but fall under the UN security  management system, which means that if they request assistance by UN  security, the UN will always provide support,” said a UN staffer, who  requested anonymity.To maintain their neutrality and not be associated with the  peacekeeping mission, he said, NGOs often chose not to request support  from the UN and prefer to handle kidnappings and other crimes against  their staff themselves.
Government under pressureIn a statement on 28 January, the US-based Human Rights Watch (HRW)  called on UNAMID to put pressure on the government of Sudan to guarantee  the security of peacekeepers and civilians.Jehanne Henry, HRW’s senior researcher on Sudan, told IRIN the issue  of impunity was entrenched and unrelenting in Darfur. “Despite the  government appointing a new special prosecutor to deal with crimes in  Darfur, the protection system remains weak and the immunity of people in  position of power continues to be problematic.”Abdel-Dayem Zumrawi, the special attorney for Darfur crimes  appointed by the Sudanese in October 2010, stepped aside recently after  two years of service.At a news conference on 27 December 2010, Zumrawi said “efforts to  serve justice in the war-torn western region have been overshadowed by  the political situation in the country”.Henry said: “If Khartoum wants to convince the people of Darfur of  its commitment to lasting peace and reconciliation, there must be a  credible threat of prosecution for those who are implicated in the  crimes committed against the people of Darfur.“There is a sentiment among many in Darfur that there is no  accountability for any act, and that those connected to power can get  away with anything,” she said.cp/js/mw
