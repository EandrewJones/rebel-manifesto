Sudanese and Chadian army and militia troops have reportedly arrived at Central Darfur to curb the violent conflicts between Misseriya and Salamat tribesmen.
Residents of Zalingei, the capital of Central Darfur, reported to Radio Dabanga that on 12 November “a large convoy of military vehicles loaded with SAF troops and pro-government militias carrying various kinds of weapons arrived.” The troops caused fear and horror among the Zalingei population city due to their “show of force” by heavily firing into the air.
The witnesses also reported that a huge joint force of Sudan and Chad army and militia troops in dozens of military vehicles mounted with various kinds of arms entered Um Dukhun Town and later moved towards the localities of Wadi Saleh, Mukjar, Bindisi and Zalingei.
The governor of Central Darfur State, Yousef Tibin Musa, announced on 11 November that the state government had sent military reinforcements to the southern regions of Central Darfur, especially to the localities of Wadi Saleh, Bindisi and Um Dukhun to “deter the lawlessness, disarm the militants among the Misseriya and Salamat, and monitor the volatile situation in the state”.
