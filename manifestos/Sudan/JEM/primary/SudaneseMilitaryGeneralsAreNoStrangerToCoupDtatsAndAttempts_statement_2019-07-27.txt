Sudanese Military Generals are no Stranger to Coup d’états and Attempts
By Mahmoud A. Suleiman
A Coup d’état oraPutschisdefinedastheone who takes part in a putschandsecretly plot and suddenly execute attempt to overthrow a government.However, when we delve intolinguistics and their historic origins that relate to the  native Swiss German, putsch originally meant “knock” or “thrust,” but these days both German and English speakers use it to refer to the kind of government overthrow also known as a coup d’état.https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/putsch
As thedelving into linguistics is necessitated by the phenomenon ofthe no ending seriesmilitary Coup d’états whichplagued the post-independence from the former Anglo-Egyptian Condominium on the dawn of Sunday the First January 1956, I find myself is obliged to be more pedantic into this linguistic digression, pardon me my dear readers.
As of July 27th2019, the Sudanese December 19th2018 Revolution has become as old as 220 Days, 7.233 Months, during which theplethora of neverendingnegotiations between the Transitional Military Council (TMC)and the Forces of Declaration of Freedom and Change (FDFC) continued unabated due toandas a result of evasion and intransigence by the military junta, which is inseparably part of the ruling regime of the repugnant National Congress Party (NCP) led by deposed dictator Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir and his entourage in the International Muslim Brotherhood Movement (MBM) Khartoum branch!During the period of seven and a half months since the outbreak of the December Revolution, there have been a series of attempts at military coups, allegedly Seven, to bring back the arbitrary regime of the ousted former (NCP) and its deposed ruler to life for the vicious circle of empowerment and crimes to continue at the expense of the disenfranchised Sudanese citizens. That ongoing plot can be easily understood if one knew firsthand that all theMilitary Juntainthe Transitional Military Council (TMC)with theexception ofGeneral Mohammed Hamdan Dogolo –aka Hamedti- aremembers of theformerNational Congress Party (NCP).
According to news media reports, especially the authentic Sudan tribune cyber journal, the issue ofJuly 25, 2019indicated thatSudan continues to arrest military officers and former officials after failed coup.

Historically, Sudan witnessed a plethora of military coups and coup attempts amounted since the dawn of Sunday the First January 1956.The Sudanese army has not fought any war to protect the borders of the land of Sudan from the incursion of foreign armies and evidence that the State of Egypt has occupied the two regions of the Sudan which are Halayeb andShalatin, while Ethiopia occupies the area of Fashaga.Thus, the biggest evidence is that SAF forces have become domesticated and castrated; pardon me for the use of those two words. It is evident that the duty to defend the rights of the homeland by the Sudan ArmedForces (SAF)hasgone with the Dictatorship priorities.
History of Military coups in Sudan indicates that, this homeland, unfortunately witnessed and suffered not less than, to exaggerate, fifteen between a successful military coup and a failed attempt.As of 8 June 2019, the Transitional Military Council (TMC) is the current military junta governing Sudan. It was established on 11 April 2019 after the 2019 Sudanese coup d’état, and is formally headed by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Inspector of the Armed Forces, after Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf resigned as leader one day following the coup. Lieutenant General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (“Hemeti”) is formally the deputy leader but seen as the de facto real leader.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_Military_Council_(2019)
Dagalo, formally the deputy leader of the Council, is the commander of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) as holding more real power in the Council than al-Burhan. The (RSF) is the immediate successor organisation to the former Janjaweed militia, after being cloned. According to news media outlets Some of the Council’s other known members include were General Jalaladdin AL sheikh, a former deputy director of security, Lieutenant General Al-Tayeb Babikir Ali Fidail, who led the public order police (POP/PDF), and Lieutenant General Omer Zain al-Abidin served as the leader of the junta’s political committee. All three tendered their resignations on 24 April 2019. General Gamal Omer of the TMC commented publicly on the 30 June 2019 mass de ministrations, attributing the responsibility for ten deaths to the protest organisers.
It is noteworthy that the Transitional Military Council (TMC) claimed several times during 2019 that a coup d’état attempt had been foiled and that those responsible had been arrested.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_Military_Council_(2019)
As ofThursday25 July 2019, the TMC had not named the alleged coup plotters of the first four coup attempts.As of 25 July 2019, the TMC had not named the alleged coup plotters of the first four coup attempts. On 12 July 2019, Gamal Omer Ibrahim of the TMC reported the fourth coup attempt, stating that twelve army and National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) officers had attempted a coup d’état against the TMC without naming the alleged conspirators. Furthermore, on 25 July, the TMC stated that a combined military-lslamist coup attempt had occurred. The TMC stated that it had arrested the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Lieutenant-General Hashim Abdel Muttalab Ahmed; Major-General Nasr al-Din Abdel Fattah; former Foreign Minister, Ali Ahmed Karti; the commander of the Central District, Major-General Bahar Ahmed; former Minister of Minerals, Kamal Abdel Latif; and Secretary-General of the Islamic Movement, Zubair Ahmed al-Hassan.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_Military_Council_(2019)
According to the BBC News that aspokesman insisted the army did not seek power and Sudan’s future would be decided by the protesters – but said the army would maintain public order.Nevertheless,Protesters are still out in Khartoum, fearing the coup leaders are too close to ousted ruler OmerHassan Ahmedal-Bashir.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-47908785
Rhetoric of the military junta (TMC) goes on whenLt-Gen Omar Zain al-Abidin, who heads the military council’s political committee, said on Friday “The solutions willbe devised by those in protest; “you, the people, will provide the solutions for all economic and political issues. We have come with noideology;we have come here to maintain order and security to provide the opportunity for the people of Sudan to achieve the change they aspire to.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-47908785
History of military coups in Sudan beginsfrom Abboud’s coup of November 17th 1958 to Nimeiri’s 25thMay 1969, Al-Bashir’s 30 June 1989 , the series that does not break and two popular revolutions in 21stOctober 1964  and in April 1985 and Followed by a third revolution in December, 19, 2018.
Ghassan Charbel,Editor in Chief of Asharq Al-Awsat newspapersays: if Libya lost four decades under ColonelMoammarKaddafi, Sudan lost three decades under Omer HassanAhmedal-Bashir. It is no exaggeration to say that Sudan, since its independence in 1956, spent a lost age among the generals and uprisings until it became exhausted by the current change. The succession of revolutions and coups drained the resources and stability of the country, rupturing its unity and dwarfing its map. The prowess of the Sudanese parties to dispel the democratic sweeps is not matched by the military’s ability to seize any chance of regaining control and seals.https://aawsat.com/home/article/1679011/%D8%BA%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%84/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%AA
The youth of Sudan after independence has been lost between the hammer of blatant foreign intervention and the ensuing episodes of military Coup d’états.
In the wake of the observation and follow-upof theorigins of thesuccessful military coups and failed coup attemptsone discovers thatthe origin ofmost of the military coups that succeeded and ruled were supported by political elements with ideologies from the far right in the case of the coup of General Ibrahim Abboud, who was supported by Mr. Abdullah Khalilwhowasbelonging to the Umma Party and the religious Ansar sect.WhereasJaafer al-Nimeriwas supported by the leftmost components formed of the Sudanese Communist Party(SCP), in addition to the Arab nationalists and the Nasserites. The coup led by Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir was supported and planned by the National Islamic Front(NIF), which is a branch of the International Muslim Brotherhood Movement(MBM) theKhartoum branch.On the other hand, one finds that otherattemptedmilitary coupsrarely hadprominent ideological support.

Stewart Staffordwhowas born in New York City to Irish parentsand whosefamily moved back to Ireland when he was three years oldandhas lived there ever sincehas been quoted as saying: “A traitor only becomes one if their plot is discovered. The imposition of guilt means nothing to those who feign loyalty. More skilled conspirators wield treason as a clinical tool of regime change and political expediency. They then, with their own hand writing history, such traitors may wear the clothes of patriots.”
