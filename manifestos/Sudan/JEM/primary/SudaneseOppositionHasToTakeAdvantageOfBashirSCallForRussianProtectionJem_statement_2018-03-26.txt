.“If we do not use the situation properly and do a lot of work in the opposition to bring down the regime, we will miss a great opportunity for our people and we only have ourselves to blame,” he stressed.Sudanese were surprised by the sudden volt face operated by the President al-Bashir and many wondered what happened to trigger this change. Several explanation were proposed to explain his statements.Ibrahim said they received reports sg that John Sullivan U.S. Deputy Secretary of State informed the government that Washington does not want to see al-Bashir running for presidency in 20202.Al-Bashir does not want to leave office because his political immunity protects him against the arrest warrants of the war crimes court (ICC) in La Haye, he further said.Sudanese foreign minister told reporters after al-Bashir return from Russia that the Sudanese president in his speech about Russian protection intended to highlight U.S. efforts at the UN Security Council to stop Sudan’s gold exportation.Al-Bashir returned to Khartoum on Friday evening from Russia after a two-day work visit where he met with his counterpart Vladimir Putin.
