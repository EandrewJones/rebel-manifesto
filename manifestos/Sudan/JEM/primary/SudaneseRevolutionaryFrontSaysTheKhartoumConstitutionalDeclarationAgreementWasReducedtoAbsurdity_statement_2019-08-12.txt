The case of the assault on the citizens of Shangil Tobay locality in North Darfur state, who were assaulted by uncontrolled groups of the Janjaweed militias who are referred to as camel herdsmen, where three citizens were killed while they were working in their farms during this  fall – rainy season – season without being protected by the state government. This tragic incident happened while the Constitutional Declaration Agreement signed by Forces of the Declaration of Freedom and Change and the Transitional Military Councilhas not giventhe required attention to issues related to peace in the regionscontinuingaffected by the warsof attrition during the past Sixteen years.Moreover,the Janjaweed forces are encircling Naivasha campfor the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)and other news that the number of martyrs has reached 9.Earlier, theJanjaweed troops stormed Naivasha camp yesterday,andthat theviolence continuesamidinjuries and martyrsandthe camp is currently besiegedwhile theviolence continues.It is Unfortunatethat the blessed Eidal-Adhain the DarfurlocalityofShangil Tobay locality has been stained by human blood instead of Lamb for Eid al – Adha.Thus, thereis  agenuineness of the points raised by the Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF) over failure of theKhartoum Constitutional Declaration Agreement to include issues of comprehensive Peace.
The Sudanese Political Elites are no Stranger to Denying their Hinterland Compatriots Basic Citizenship Rights.
النخب السياسية السودانية ليست غريبة على إنكار حقوق المواطنة الأساسيةلمواطنيهم فيالمناطق النائية.
It is noteworthy to point out from the outset as to why the components in the Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF) reject the outcome of the Khartoum Constitutional Declaration(KCD). They indicated in their memoranda that the (KCD)document wasdevoid ofany reference to peace and abjectly failed to merely referring to the sacrosanct phrase that the Sudaneserevolutionarieswho sacrificed their lives and every precious asset for the achieving peace and other slogans they sangby repeating Freedom, Peace and Justice all through the period from 19 December 2018 until the overthrow of the ruling regime of the deposed National Congress Party (NCP)andits ousted Dictator, Omer al-Bashir. That is why theSudanese RevolutionaryFront (SRF)is protestingagainst thefailureof theConstitutionalDeclarationtoincludepeace filewithin its contents. It is needless to reiterate the fact thatthere is no stability for Sudan without the achievement of peace, and theissuesrelated to theindictmentsissued byTheHague-basedInternational Criminal Court(ICC),along with other very important issues such as TransitionalJustice, the return ofthe Internally DisplacedPersons (IDPs)and refugeesback totheiroriginallands andvillages, reparation, and the restoration of social fabric through reconciliation based on the heritageand traditionsof theCivilAdministration, and liftingthe63-yearpost-independencehistorical injustice throughmutualdialogue withthe representatives of thedisenfranchisedchronicallymarginalised majority who arethereal stakeholders.It is high time to refrain from the discrimination that reachedthetopend ofitssummit.It was in some way similar to the practice oftheapartheid during theformerrule ofthewhitesupremacistSouth Africa.Unfortunately, that is one of the most important reasons that precipitated the secession of the citizens of Sudan in the region of South Sudan and formed their state called South Sudan.
The Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF) continued reiterating its dissatisfactionwith theConstitutionalDocument which it believes that it has placed obstacles in the way of any future peace.Furthermore, the (SRF) announced its rejection of the document of theConstitutionalDeclaration signed between theForces ofDeclaration of Freedom andChange(FDFC)andthe Transitional MilitaryCouncil (TMC).
ThoughOmer al-Bashirhas gone, but his regime is fighting backin disguise. The result is total stalemate.
The notion that Hemetti and the Transitional Military Council Junta or any other security figure could underpin stability or state cohesion in Sudan is thought by international analysts as a red herring.https://thehill.com/opinion/international/455156-sudan-faces-an-inflection-point-and-needs-us-leadership
الجبهة الثورية السودانية تقول إن اتفاقيةالاعلان الدستورى فىالخرطوم قد خُفضت إلى حد السخف
Disrespect and systematic injustice since independence are still practiced by the politicians of the Northern Nilotic Elitesagainst the components of the marginalized Citizensin Sudan
لا يزال عدم الاحترام والظلم الممنهج منذ الاستقلال يمارسه النخب السياسية من الشمال النيلىضد مكونات المواطنين المهمشين في السودان
It is time to talk about the subject that has been silent about since independence
حان الوقت للحديث عن الموضوع المسكوت عنه منذ الاستقلال
However, some political analysts indicated that the Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF) should bear some of the blame in the constitutional declaration between the forces of theDeclaration of Freedom and Change and the Transitional Military Council in Khartoum.
ولكن بعض المحللين يقولون ان الجبهة  الثورية السودانية يجب ان تتحمل بعض الاثم مما حدث فى الاعلان الدستورى بين قوات اعلان الحرية و التغيير و المجلس العسكرى الانتقالى فى الخرطوم
This debate continued unceasingly in the form of criminalizing each other
هذا الجدال ظل مستمراً من دون توقف فى شكل تجريم كل واحد للآخر

This applies to the Margin of the Sudan in the sense that they know the things too late

There is no benefit to cry over spilled milk
لا ينفع البكاء على اللبن المسكوب
“It’s no use crying over spilt milk,” which means that getting upset over certain things, like spilled milk, is not going to fix it.
The Oxford English Dictionary defines the phrase “it’s no use crying over spilt milk” anditsmany variations as meaning “it is futile to regret what cannot be altered or undone.” The dictionary’s first published citation comes from a collection of English proverbs by James Howell (1659): “No weeping for shed milk.”

It seems that in Sudan, unfortunately, is still suffers the throes of neo-colonization or the remnants of colonization. The question that poses itself forcibly is as to whether we in Sudan after 63 odd years of Independence, are we actually living and acting in oblivion?

لم تعد العقيدة السياسية المتمثلة في إلقاء اللوم على شخص آخر مثمرة
The political doctrine of Blaming Somebody Else is no longer fruitful
An ethos of greed had taken over the whims of both the Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change and the Transitional Military Council in dealing with the sensitive issues of the Constitutional Declaration in Khartoum
لقد استحوذت روح الجشع على نزوات كل من القوات من أجل إعلان الحرية والتغيير والمجلس العسكري الانتقالي في التعامل مع القضايا الحساسة للإعلان الدستوري في الخرطوم.

The main headlines in the electronic newspapers issued during the weekcarried reports relatingto the Sudanese Revolutionary Front being excluded from the Constitutional Declaration Document as follows:
The degree of injustice reached the summit until it made the SPLM-N leader Abdul Aziz al-Helu not seem to reject only the agreement between the Forces for Declaring Freedom and Change (FDFC) – aka Qaht-  and the Transitional Military Council (TMC)  but for  him, the Glorious December 19 2018 Revolution was aborted or about to be aborted. Abdel Aziz is the man who has not experienced any peace agreement with the government of Khartoum and began more hard-line before and resolve the Sudanese crisis has not linked to the rule of the ousted regime of what was called the Islamic National Salvation Revolution led by the ousted genocidal criminal Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, like many, the solution in his view is like calling for the restructuring of the Sudanese state, which has been dominated by limited forces from  the center made up of the elites originally belonged to the Northern Nilotic Tribal entities since the country’s independence and exploited all thepolitical powerresourceswith exclusion of the other inhabitants of the country once one million square miles size.
Important notice:This alert is very important; Dear readers here, I hope you will excuse me. I was not at any time tries to touch on this very sensitive subject that remained silent about it for quite a long time. But, as they say, patience haslimits; in this time seems to havereached the summit and the torrent run out of controland thePassionate emotions preceded the restraint.As you know, dear reader, injustice is a scourge, especially if it comes fromthe most closely related individuals such as friends andrelativesorthose who you put unwavering trust in them to represent you in political forums for the rights and duties that concern the citizen. At this junction, that trust regrettably has not been hounered by those who have been chosen to represent the disenfranchisedand chronically marginalised populations along the country’s vasthinterland, especially in theformer Sudaneseprovinces of Kordofan, Darfur,South of the Blue Nile in Ingasana, Red Sea Eastern Sudan andSouthern Sudan beforethe latter inhabitants demandedseparationregrettably after beingforcedto opt forsecessionfrom Sudan, once the largest and one of the most geographically diverse states in Africa, split into two countries in July 2011 after the people of the south voted for independencetogetawayfromthe  racism emanating  fromthebelief that one’s own race is superiorwhich isthe tendency of the SudaneseNortherners who tendedfalselyclaimthat they areof Arab ancestryof the Abbasid dynastyand others are black Africans;that is an obviouspsychologicalmechanism known as Inferiority Complex of feeling ofanextremesubservience and to get some relief, they have to project those feelings to others, such as referring to them as niggers blackamoorwhile they are more black than coal.Black is beautiful, though!THIS IS IT!
One believes there has never been a more important time to understand how those in the Northern political classdojustwhat theydon’t want to admit, clinging on what is sometimes called the mute devil.But the truth and frankness also must not condone the role of some of the components of the margin who are humiliating themselves in front of their Masters of Grace from the North Nilotic Region in order to get some crumbsby fiercely attacking their representatives in theArmed Struggle Forces/ armed movements, such as the one calling himself as Ahmed al-Sadiq Masar from the East Darfur State.That individual, calling himself Massar continued his violent attack and insulting with the ugliest qualities, as well as accusing them with treason and running behind international axes to sell the revolution etc.Some analysts believe that the method of attack emanating from the person who called himself Ahmed al-Sadiq  must be one of those blokes who have  fallen from the armed movements and fell into the arms of the ruling regime of the deposed National Congress Party(NCP)to get some crumbs at the expense of the citizens in the marginalized zones in exchange for a classified intelligence reaching the enemy in a betrayal of the Issueofthepeople in themarginalizedzones for which weapons were taken upin the firstplace.Thus, the issue of marginalized areas in Darfur, the Nuba Mountains, Blue Nile and eastern Sudan was negatively affected and was unable to achieve the goals for which the rebels fought against the arbitrarynational nightmarerule that lasted three decades.
This article comes against the backdropof theAgreement between theTransitional Military Council(TMC)and the Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change(FFC)on the outcomes of the Constitutional Declaration, which has been remaining static in its place for a long time without moving, while the Sudanese public who staged the DecemberRevolution waited breath holding but the result has been regrettably disappointing especially for the membership of theallied armed groups of the Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF) who tirelessly struggled andfiercelyfought theIslamismregime of the so-called ‘National’ Congress Party (NCP)and its Deposed Genocidal Dictatorial leader Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir for the past 17 odd Years.At this stage one would say the least that the outcome of the division of spoilsis surrounded by extreme injustice.But even worse, the bilateral negotiator turned a blind eye to the reference to the Sudanese Revolutionary Front. The phrase “armed movements” was loosely mentioned, opening the door to anyone who called himself armed force, even those who cooperated with the regime led by Marshall al-Bashir, a war criminal, perpetrator of crimes against humanity and crimes of genocide and Fugitive from international justice and being chased by the international Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague in the Netherlands since the year 2009.
The deal struck between the (TMC) and the Forces for Declaration of Freedom and Change (FFC), indicated in their memorandum that they have signed an agreement providing to establish a 39-monthTransitionalAuthority in Sudan to achieve political and economic reforms before to holdGeneralElections!http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article67889
The foregoing agreement took place while totally forgetting or ignoring the Last July 2019,accord  whenthe Forces for Declaration of Freedom and Change (FFC) political groups agreed with their allied Armed groups of the Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF) on a roadmap on ways to achieve peace during the transitional period.http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article67889
By doing so, the duoof  (TMC) and  the  (FFC)  haveexcluded  all the political groups that are part of the (SRF) from the ” political equation”, as stated by the Sudanese Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), Dr. Gibril Ibrahim Mohammed.
The foregoing assertion of the (JEM) leader by no means did come from a vacuum. That is because The Sudanese Revolutionary Front (SRF) presented a project to break Sudan’s historical structural imbalance to establish peace, but it has been disappointed,”as rightlyreiteratedby the Chairman  Minni Arko Minnawi the leader of  the  Sudan  Liberation  Movement / Army  (SLM/A)in a tweet posted on Sunday, the 4thof July 2019.
Thus, the outcome of the agreement between theTransitionalMilitaryJunta(TMC), the elitesof the center and the north of the Nile River will not be welcomed by all the constituents of the Sudanese people and their real representatives represented by the Sudanese Revolutionary Front(SRF)which the people of Sudan trust.
As it had been said in the entire human edits injustice is darkness and the relationship between peoples and ruling regimes is not established if confidence does not exist as it is in the case of the Sudanese state under the leadership of the egoists of the racist leaders.The opportunism that uses the Machiavelli’s doctrineof“the Ends Justify the Means” will no longer deceive  the acute acumen of the Sudanese people who regrettably experienced  such types of political deceptions for so long.
Asthe world  knows that a popular uprising in Sudan toppled dictator Omer al-Bashir after 30 years in power, while his party leaders are accused of systematically destroying the country, hurting opponents, and many suspicions of corruption.
The Exploitation of us continues at the hands of the Neo- Colonials.What is the problem with which we, the Sudanese people, continued suffer during the decades after the so-called independence we the marginalized; we call it exploitation whereas the elites in the entity of the Northern Nilotic Territory refer toit as Independence which in fact ofthematter it is nothing but “a Neo-colonialism” figuratively!
