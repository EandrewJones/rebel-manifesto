For immediate release
Suppression of Peaceful Protests and Mass Arrests
On March 21, the Sudanese National Security and Intelligence Services (NISS) in cooperation with the police arrested a number of Sudanese students all over the country for launching protests against the Government of Sudan. The security forces usedexcessive force to quell the peaceful protests that started in some universities across the country in January and February this year, inspired by popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt that ousted these countriesâ€™ respective governments.
The Human Rights and Advocacy Network for Democracy calls on the Sudanese government and the security forces to respect the right to free expression of views guaranteed in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
The Human Rights and Advocacy Network for Democracy condemns the excessive use of force on the side of the security forces and the arbitrary arrests in the strongest terms and calls for the immediate release of the protestors.
