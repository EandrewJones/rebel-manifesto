Synchronization of dictatorkilling his people with the acquittal of the former head of the Ivory Coast by the ICC today
By Mahmoud A. Suleiman
This article comes against the backdrop of two occasions, namely the oppressive crackdown of the continuing peaceful uprising of the Sudanese public throughout the country by the Omer al-Bashir and the other event being the acquittal of the indicted Ivorian President and his associate by the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague today the 15thJanuary 2019.
Peoplearound theworld and in Sudan are asking and wondering in surprise and angeras to whyOmer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir continuestampering withthe ruling of Sudan for so long? However, they realised the fact underlying his Strong adherence to the presidency of Sudan. They came to the conclusion that al-Bashir remains  afraid of his pursuance by   the International Criminal Court (ICC) since his indictment of crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of genocide in the region of Darfur in the western Sudan since 2009. He remains ever since a fugitive from the international justice and a pariah of the people of the countries of the free World. Had it not for his cowardice, he could simply present himself voluntarily to the (ICC) as did some of his African leaders. The people of the World know that the (ICC) had acquitted African presidents indicted by the same court suchthe KenyanPresidentUhuru Kenyatta. Furthermore, as a surprise, on Tuesday, January 15, 2019,Ex-Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo has been acquitted at (ICC). He was theformer Ivory Coastpresident,who ruled Côte d’Ivoire in 2000to 2011.In addition to the release ofLaurent Gbagbo, hisfellow accused Charles Pelleyhas been released as innocent by the same Court which some voices from the African Union (AU) saying that the (ICC) only targeting the AfricanCountry rulers.

Having that being said, people ask as to whythe Indicted Sudanese President OmerHassan Ahmed al-Bashirremains so fearful oftheInternational Criminal court(ICC) at The Hague in the Netherlands? People continue asking that Omer al-Bashirinstead of adhering to the dictatorial rule and playingthe role of the herowhilein fact he is cowardlywho pours all his anger on the people of Sudanand hateful to the people of Sudan in general and the people of Sudan in the Darfur region in particular. He believes that by doing so he canavoid beingcapturedby the International CriminalCourt (ICC). Thus, heremainsunderthe protection ofhisgang ofthe so-calledIslamicMovement regime, the National Congress Party (NCP)and othermembers of theentourage ofthe former Janjaweedmilitiasrenamed as Rapid SupportForce (RSF)and alongwith thegangs of mercenariesfrom the neighbouring African countriesandtheremnants of the SudanArmedForces(SAF)that have been subjectedto domesticationduring thelean30 years of arbitrary rule in Sudan. In criminal law, the Confession by theaccused“defendant”isconsideredthe strongestevidence in the Court of Law. The President of the National Congress Party (NCP) Marshall Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir has already admitted that he has killed only 10,000 people in Darfur, not the number of the charges relate to the conflict in Darfur, which has saying that ithas killed300,000 people and displaced about two million according to UN figures.His confession to the killing of 10,000 people in Darfur makes Omer al-Bashir afraid of the International Criminal Court(ICC)and tries to avoid arrest because he knows for certain that his fate in The Hague willbespendinghis life in prisonfor ever.Al-Bashir’s insistence on asserting power by all means, including the killing of peaceful demonstrators in the December 19, 2018 uprising throughout Sudan which call for the demise of the corrupt,hypocrite and failed rule of Omer al-Bashir, who trades in the name of the Islamic religion while his type of unjustrule is a blatant violation of the teachings of Islam, which calls for peace and justice.It is strange that this al-Bashir convicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) does not try to take from history andfromwhathashappened to similar rulers in the neighboring countriessuch asMuammar GaddafiinLibyaand Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen and in Tunisia to the President Tunisian ousted Zine El Abidine Ben Aliwho fled toSaudi Arabiafor asylum. It is the truth that the tyrants have no memory and their degree of assimilation of the lessons is weaker than the weak, so to speak.  Omer al-Bashir is no stranger to the above-mentioned behaviour with his impaired thought and memory.The ICC first indicted Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir in March 2009,the second on 12 July 2010
Out of fear of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Omer al-Bashir is committing more crimes to be added his criminal record. This time, his crimes are not limited to the Sudanese citizens in Darfur only butthey are nationwide crimes of shoot to kill type carried out by disguised snipers belonging to the Shadow Army of the National Islamic Front (NIF) in Sudan, which Ali Osman Mohammed Taha referred to it during his slip of the tongue. It is a secret army,shadowed Malesia,formed from the amounts of money that were saved from oil revenues by the then Minister of oil and minerals in the Government of the National Congress Party (NCP), AwadAhmed al-Jaz. There are a reported fifty cars without numbers plates attacked the peaceful demonstrators with the firing of live ammunition and it is undoubtedly a part of the hidden army of Ali Osman Mohamed Taha.But these killers and their mastermind leaders cannot escape accountability and will be brought to transitional justice of the public courts and will receive theappropriatepunishmentfor their heinous crimes.In issuing the warrant, Pre-Trial Chamber I stated that there are reasonable grounds to believe that:
Pre-Trial Chamber I also found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that:
Pre-Trial Chamber I found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Omar Al Bashir acted with specific intent to destroy in part the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa ethnic groups.

PresidentOmar al-Bashirof Sudan has said for the first time that he accepts full personal responsibility for the conflict in Darfur that left tens of thousands of people dead.
But in an exclusive interview with the Guardian, his first with a western news organisation since he was charged with genocide by the international criminal court (ICC), Bashir accuses the UN-backed court of “double standards” and conducting a “campaign of lies”.
Britain and other western countries were pursuing a politically motivated vendetta against him with the ultimate aim of forcing regime change inSudanas well as in neighbouring Libya, he said.
“Of course, I am the president so I am responsible about everything happening in the country,” Bashir said when asked about the conflict inDarfur, in western Sudan, where fighting is continuing despite international peace efforts.
“Everything happening, it is a responsibility. But what happened in Darfur, first of all, it was a traditional conflict taking place from the colonial days.
When he was askedhow the “Arab spring” uprisings might affect Sudan, where Arabic speakers comprise a large majority of the northern population, Bashir said the small protests calling for increased democracy lacked broad support. “It will not have an impact like what happened in Egypt, Tunisia or even Libya, I don’t think so.”A reform process was already underway”he said.

The question that remains to be answered is whether Omer al-Bashir will recognize that he is responsible for killing peacefully protesting Sudanese citizens who were killed by what is known as the Shadow Army, which was formed by the former National Islamic Front (NIF) and its heir thecurrentruling regime of the National Congress Party(NCP). A boisterous question awaits a convincing answer.
The next legitimate and timely question is whether Marshall Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir the (ICC) indictee and fugitive from the international justice for so long, would surrender himself to the International Criminal Court (ICC), as did his ilk the Kenyan President Uhuru Muigai Kenyattathe fourth and current President of the Republic of Kenya? That is the $64 questionor the sixty-four silver dollars prize on answering the question!Kenya’s President, Uhuru Kenyatta, has become the first sitting head of state toappearbefore the International CriminalCourt(ICC)in The Hague.https://www.google.com/search?ei=iyE-XNuQJ6aV1fAP2uuluAw&q=kenyan+president+uhuru++kenyatta+goes+to+the+icc+in+The+Hague&oq=kenyan+president+uhuru+
Omar al-Bashir, president of Sudan, was indicted by the ICCon 12 July 2010for the crime of genocide. It is the first instance of the ICC issuing a warrant for genocide to a sitting head of state.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur_genocid

To conclude, one could say: “Whatever Omer al-Bashir says to justify his crimes during his oppressive rein of the lean 30-years, will not change the factsand the painful facts that occurred during his reign against the Sudanese civilians who were defenseless, who suffered from  his armed militias and mercenaries along with suffering from poverty, destitution, disease, hunger under the corrupt deep state Kleptocrat members of the National Islamic Front (NIF)/National Congress Party (NCP) regime. It is high time for al-Bashir to depart the rule of Sudanandleave before happens to him what happened to his ilk and must read the history of his likes who were similar in repression and cruelty to their people in the region.

The Sudanese Protesters kept chanting “freedom, peace, justice” and “revolution is Freedom is the people’s choiceand only fall of the regime is the request of the people. Thus Bashir’s speech failed to quell the unrest, with security forces fighting running battles with peaceful protesters unabatedly since December 19th2018all over the country. The protestson Wednesday in Omdurman on the other side of the Nile to the capitalhave called for al-Bashir to resign.But the arrogant Omer al-Bashir on Monday 14 the January 2019 said the ongoing protests wouldn’t topple his regime vowing to punish those who carry out the acts of sabotage.http://www.sudantribune.com/
According to Sudan Tribune, the embattled Omer al-BashirSpeakingto crowds in Nyala,thecapital of South Darfur on Monday14thJanuary 2019, a day after protesters took to the streets there for the first time, al-Bashir pointedconfessing that therearereasonsfor theuprising andthat there weregovernment efforts to address the economic crisis.He further said:“We acknowledged the existence of the crisis but it wouldn’t be addressed through sabotage and destruction,” he said.But Bashir was short of saying the expected to admit the fact even at the last moment, as did his ilk theformer deposed dictator of Tunisia, Zayn al-Ābidīn bin Alī who said: “Now I understood you” addressing his former people of  Tunisia. Before hewas forced tofleetothe Kingdom ofSaudi Arabia.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine_El_Abidine_Ben_Ali
It is certain that the popular demonstrations against the ruling regime in Sudan will continue and aim to overthrow the regime and remove it from the rule of Sudan as it was before for totalitarian military regimes on 21 October 1964 against Ibrahim Abboud and in April 1985 against the rule of Muhammad Jaafar Nimeiri.
