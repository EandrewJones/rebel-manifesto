TheAUHIPneedsto revisit itsmodusoperandi
Thelatest round of theAfrican Union HighLevelImplementation Panel (AUHIP)’sconsultationswith Sudanese parties in Addis Ababa(December 9 -13)ended in failure for reasons that are quite bizarre.The Sudan Call, which is Sudan’s broadest opposition political alliance, and includes fourout of the fiveoriginal signatoriesof the 2016 Road Map Agreement, sent a delegation to Addis Ababalast weekin the expectation of holding consultations with President Mbeki on the way forward on implementation of the Road Map Agreement.The Sudan Call was looking forwardto substantive discussions with President Mbeki onhow to achieve a conducive environmentthat could lead to an inclusive political process and acomprehensive political settlement.  Such discussionsare particularly urgentat a time when Sudan faces a plethora of problems, including fuel, bread and transportshortages, hyperinflation and a sharply depreciating currency, not to mentionserious human rights violations andthecontinuedsuffering of millions in the conflict zones.Although the AUHIP-led peace process has been dormant foralong time, the Sudan Call hascontinued to reiterate its commitment to the Road Map Agreement and to prepare for the eventual resumption of the Road Map process by sendingPresident Mbekiits position papers inadvance of this latest round.To the disappointment of the Sudan Call, however, President Mbeki refused to meet their delegation in Addis and insistedthat he would only be prepared to meetthree of the Sudan Call’s foursignatories.  When the Sudan Call refused to accept these restrictions, the AUHIP issued aconcludingstatementclaiming that itsinsistence on the participation of non-signatories in the consultationswas a position that “contradicted the objectives of the meeting. As a result, the consultations could not be completed”.Thischaracterisation of the reasons for failure of the latest round is completely unfair.All correspondence sent by the Imam Sadiq al Mahdi to President Mbeki about the Road Map Processoverthe last two years has been signed in his capacity as Chairpersonof the Sudan Call, not as Chair of the Umma Party.  The Panel’s invitation letter of 26 November wassimilarly addressed to him as Chairman. It is true that this letter referred toinviting a delegation of signatories of the Road Map Agreement for consultations but the Imam made it clear in his response on 28 November that the persons who would be coming to the consultations would represent the Sudan Call,including members of its Leadership Council in addition to the signatories.The AUHIP raised no objection and proceeded to facilitate travel arrangements and hotel accommodation for all the Sudan Call membersprovidedby the Chairperson’s office,irrespective of whether they were signatories or not.The AUHIP even wrote to the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry asking them to facilitate visas for the non-signatories.  If President Mbeki was only willing to meet representatives of the Umma Party, JEM and SLM/Minni Minawi (the only three signatories the AUHIP now seems prepared to recognise), it is difficult to understand why theAUHIPofficiallyinvitedand fundedwell-known members of the Sudan Call who do not belong to these three organisations, includingMalik Agar, Omer Al Digair, Hamid Ali Nour,Yasir Arman,Ahmed Shakir, Eltom Hajo,MohamedDawoudand Usama Saeedto come to Addis.Moreover, thereis no conceivable reason whythe Panelwould haveinvitedJEM and SLM/MMthrough the Imamand passed all messages to them about the Addis meeting throughhimunlessitrecognisedhimas the Chairperson of Sudan Call.Oneobvious questionthat arises from thisis why the Panel wasteditspreciousresourcesby fundingnon-signatory members of the Sudan Call to come toAddis if it had no intention of meeting them?There appears to be no consistency in the Panel’s approach to meeting the Sudan Call.  For example, President Mbekiand some of his staff met Omer Al Digair, Hamid Ali Nour and othernon-signatory members of the Sudan Call during his recent visit to Khartoumin October 2018.Abdul Mohamed, President Mbeki’s Chief of Staff, met four members of the Sudan Call, including the SPLM/N faction led by Malik Agar, in Berlin in November 2018.Why isit permissible to meetSudan Call membersfor consultationsin Khartoumor Berlinbut not in Addis Ababa, particularly when they have been facilitated to travel there by the Panel?Even more confusingly, President Mbeki assured the Sudan Call Chairperson in writing on 12 December 2018 that “In accordance with our mandate, the Panel will continue to interact with all members of the Sudan Call and other Sudanese political formations in its efforts to facilitate the resolutionof the various challenges that Sudan faces”.   Yet on the very same day, he refused to interact with the Sudan Call delegationthat had been brought toAddisAbaba from all over the world to meet him.A degree of consistency is requiredfrom the Panelso that weandotherscanat least understand its behaviour.The Panel invited Malik Agar, Yassir Arman and Mubarak Ardoul for consultations in Addis Ababa less than two weeks before convening thislatestfailed round of consultations.

TheRoad Map Agreement acknowledged that theso-called National Dialogue organized bytheGovernment of Sudan wasnotsufficientlyinclusiveandhenceprovided for the AUHIP to convenea preparatory meeting to discuss how tomake theNational Dialogueprocessmore inclusive.  Itistherefore counter-productivefor the Panel to refuse to meet political parties, movementsand civil society organizations thathaveorganized themselves under one umbrella tohelpthe Panel todischarge its mandate toachieve a moreinclusive political process.
It isonlyto be expectedthat theruling partyin Khartoum,that has monopolisedpower for three decades and aspires to dosoindefinitely,doesnot tocomprehend the benefits ofpoliticalinclusivity.  Indeedthe Government of Sudanhas already violated the Road Map Agreement byunilaterally terminating its own National Dialogue before a preparatory meeting could be convened,adopting acontroversialElectoral Law in preparation for more rigged elections andundermining the constitution-making process by proposing constitutional amendmentsto remove term limits so that President Bashir can be President for life. It is also to be expected that the Government of Sudan shouldbetryingtodivide anddestroy the Sudan Call in accordance with its well-established divide and rule policy. But it is difficult tounderstandwhy the Panel shouldbow to pressure from the regimeregarding who it can and cannot meet.For the Panel tosucceedin helping theSudanese to solvetheir problems,an objective that ithas so far failed to achieve in nearly ten years,it needs moreefficiency,transparency and consistency in its modus operandi.Italsoneeds a bigger anda better equipped staff thatcanfulfil the requirements ofits mandatewhichhasrecentlybeen expanded to cover the Horn of Africa.
