Despite the absence of the two rebel leaders, Abdulaziz Al-Hilu and Abdel-Wahid Muhammad Ahmed el-Nour from the historic occasion to sign the peace agreementin theCapital of the Republic of South Sudan Juba, the Sudanese people werehappy andjubilantly dancing in Juba and in Khartoum, rejoicing the coming of the much needed peace which will silence the humming sound of guns and cannons. Yes, this peaceagreementthough seems incomplete to some of the Sudanese people but it is, avery importantstep in the eyes of the majority who lived the atrocities of the wars and will definitely put an end to the war and open a new page in the history of Sudan. This finally signed Sudanese Peace Agreement in Juba has been reached after arduous
consultations anddiscussions betweenthe rebel groups and the mediators as well as thefacilitators thatlasted more than a year in Juba whereserious discussions overthe aspects of the Sudanese problem with full transparencyanddetermination of the Sudanese parties to reacha just and a sustainablepeace, ending the wars and fighting between the people of the country and the efforts of the mediators, they reached this historic achievement.

Yes, peace was not complete as the Sudanese people wished, but this peace, despite its defects, is an important step in the eyes of some and will end the war and open anewpage in the history of Sudan. We congratulate all the Sudanese people for signing the peace agreement that was signed today in Juba, the capital of the State of South Sudan.
After consultations and discussions that lasted more than a year in Juba, discussing the aspects of the Sudanese problem with full transparency, with the determination of the Sudanese parties to reach peace, ending the wars and fighting between the people of the country and the efforts of the mediators, they reached this historic achievement. Peace of Juba turned the page of war and confirmed that peace comes with serious dialogue, desire, will and determination, peace of Juba, the victory of the people’s will, by achieving the second pillar of the revolution slogan (peace). It is true that there are comrades from the armed struggle forces who did not sign in Juba, including the two major movements,Sudan People’s Liberation Movement – North led by Abdulaziz Al-Hilu, and theSudan Liberation Movement army commanded by Abdul Wahid Muhammad Ahmad al-Nur;, they are part andparcel andessential componentsof thecomradeswho have taken uparms andcontributed intothe Sudanese revolution and an essential part of this peace.As it is understood, they are not against the Juba Peace Agreement, but they have their reservations despite most of their demandswerewritten andtaken record of themin theFinal JubaPeaceAgreement signed between the Sudanese Revolutionary Front(SRF)and the transitionalSudanesegovernment.It is strongly belied that the two holdouts are expected to catch up with peace in the near future.with theongoing efforts of the mediators and facilitators with thecontinuation of the dialogue and further consultations with them, they will soon join peace, and this peace belongs to all the Sudanese people and is protected by the Sudanese people, and whoever wants to obstruct this peace or wants to promote or trade in the absence of the Abdel Wahidand Al-Hilu movements to obstruct the peace process will find himself face to face with the Sudanese people.
Thesquabblesbetween the Sudanese armed movements, whether belonging to the Darfur region or in other regions, in addition to the policies of the defunct regime of the National CongressParty (NCP) and its genocidal ousted President played evil tactics to delay the reaching to a just, comprehensive and sustainable peace during the past 17 years of war for the case of the Darfur region.
It is not surprising that some of the armed movements have missed the event of the final signing of the SudanesePeace, which took place in the capital of the sisterlystate of South Sudan on Saturday the third of October 2020, in thepresence of theregional and internationalcircles thatrepresented by the African Union(AU), the European Union(EU), the Arab League, the United Nations(UN), and of coursethe presence of thehead of thetransitionalperiodof Sudan, represented byGeneralAbdel-Fattah Al-Burhan, and the transitionalPrimeMinister, Dr. Abdalla Hamdok,but unfortunatelytwo leaders of the armed struggle movements were absent from the unique occasion, Abdul Wahid Muhammad Ahmed al-Nur, head of the Sudan Liberation Movement and Army from Darfur, and Commander Abdulaziz Al-Hilu  Theleaderof theSudanPeople’s Liberation Army in North Sudan, while attended and signed the final peace agreement, the Sudan Justice and Equality Movement(JEM) led by Dr. Gibril Ibrahim Muhammedand the Sudanpeople’sLiberation Movement, the leadership ofGeneralMalik Agar, and the head of the Sudanese Revolutionary Front(SRF), Dr. Al-Hadi Idris, also attended the head of the Sudan Liberation Movement and Army, Minni Arku Minnawi and the rest of therepresentatives  Armedmovements.
The SudanesePeacehas beenfinallysigned inJubaasthe first of the most important steps to return Sudan to the right path. Protecting and implementing Juba peace is the responsibility of every Sudanesecitizenanditrequires great effortslocally,coupled withregionaland internationalassistance.
Those Sudanese components who suffered the scourge of the absurd wars of attrition willbesending theirheartfeltthanks to the people of SouthSudan, the governmentof President Salva Kiir, the United States of America, theRepublicof Chadrepresented by Marshal Idriss Déby Itno, the European Union(EU), the state of Ethiopia,Djibouti,Somalia, andthe Gulf Cooperation Council, theArab Republic of Egypt,the UAE,Qatar,the Arab League,formally the League of Arab States, the African Union(AU), the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia(KSA)and all those who contributed to the peace process in Sudan.
It is noteworthy that theupcomingstage after the signing of peace isconsidered astage oftirelessworkfor building of what has destroyed by warsandproviding the means ofstability.Thus, the Sudanese government and its people mustall strive and workhardwithhonesty andfull force in cities, rural areas and camps for theinternallydisplacedpeople (IDPs) and refugeesto remove the effects of wars and destruction, and to build and reconstruct what the war has destroyed.The slogan will be:  “Withpeaceand stability,we build Sudan and fulfill the hopes ofthe coming generation.AND WE WILL KEEP ChantingWelcome to peace and silence to the sound of weapons and cannons!
Wepaythe warmest congratulations on signing the dream of Sudan (peace), a dream that was fulfilled with the determination and wisdom of our leaders in the Sudan Revolutionary Movement and Front.
The proud people of Sudan are the people who have been very patient with the ravages of injustice, persecution and displacement, and have suffered from wars and their woes. Now has come the hour of salvation from the painful bitterness of the past. The hour of work has come, the hour of hope, development and safety has come.
The history of our country has witnessed wars imposed on it, whose effects intensified every day, and brutal repression reaped innocent souls in the Nuba Mountains, Blue Nile and Darfur, and millions of Sudanese people have suffered from miserable living conditions due to the financial and administrative corruption of the gangs of the defunct regime.
The people of Sudan at this juncture hope that the signing of Sudan’s peace inJubatoachieve a comprehensiveimplementationtoaddressallof the Sudanese crisis, becauseit isbelievedthat there isthe necessity of uniting the ranks and mobilizing energies to develop and achieve the aspirations andlongings of the Sudanese people, and thisseems tohavebeen achievedon Saturday the 3rdof October 2020. We cannot but beseech the Almighty to sponsor this agreement and pledge to his care.
We also ask the forces that signed the agreement to accelerate the pace of joint action and activate its mechanisms to implement the slogans of the glorious December2018 Revolution:(Freedom,Peace andJustice). We hope to see this gigantic agreement fully and effectively implemented on the ground.
We sendourheartfeltgreetingsandcongratulations today to our righteous martyrs, on top of them the martyr of dutylateDr. Khalil IbrahimMuhammedand his compatriotscolleaguesamong themthemartyr Jammali HassanJalaladdin and as wellto our wounded,themissing and to their families.
Glory and eternity to the martyrs of the revolution and the speedy healing for its wounded
The Juba Peace Agreement for Sudan was signed on Saturdaythe thirdof October 2020, anddespite someradical reservationsin some political forces and armed rebels, itwill not preventan individualfrom being optimistic about it.As theBritishleader Winston Churchillhas been reported to havesaid that he is optimistic because everything except optimism is useless. The optimism of the people of Sudan is in the midst of the evils of our instinct for survival. Churchill also said ifyou find yourself wading in Hell, you continue to wade through, and in it you will be saved!
Ome would like to bring at the end of thisarticlethe transcriptofthe United NationsSecretary-General’svideomessage at the signing ceremony of the Juba Peace Agreement:https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-03/secretary-generals-video-message-the-signing-ceremony-of-the-juba-peace-agreement
António Guterres, the ninth Secretary-General of the United Nationssaid:
“The signing of the Juba Peace Agreement signals the dawn of a new era for the people of Sudan.It is a milestone on the road to achieving sustainable peace and inclusive development.I commend the signatories for working towards the common objective of peace, despite the difficulties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.I also commend the Government of South Sudan for its role in facilitating the negotiations during these challenging circumstances.Today’s ceremony has special meaning for the people of Darfur, offering hope for a more peaceful and prosperous future.The United Nations has been proud to support the Darfur track of the talks through the UN–African Union Mission in Darfur.
Now it is critical that the agreement translates into tangible improvements in people’s lives.As we look ahead, we know that achieving an inclusive, comprehensive and country-wide peace requires all parties at the table.I call on the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement–North Abdelaziz Al-Hilu to fully engage in negotiations — embracing the opportunity presented by the recent signing of the agreement on principles alongside Prime Minister Hamdok in Addis Ababa.I also call on the Sudan Liberation Army Abdul Wahid Al-Nur to immediately join the peace process.Ensuring successful implementation will require sustained commitment and collaboration of all parties for the well-being of the people of Sudan.The United Nations looks forward to supporting this historic journey towards peace.
Thank you.https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-10-03/secretary-generals-video-message-the-signing-ceremony-of-the-juba-peace-agreement
