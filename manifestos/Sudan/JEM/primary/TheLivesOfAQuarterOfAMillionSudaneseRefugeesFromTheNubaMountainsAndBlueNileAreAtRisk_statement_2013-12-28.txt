Sudanese refugees from the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile, who are in refugee camps in South Sudan near the border of Sudan, are facing a difficult situation after the United Nations agencies and other NGOs left them as the result of the ongoing crisis in the Republic of South Sudan. They are facing difficult choices of either staying without humanitarian assistance,especially the new arrivals among them, or going back to the war zone to join around 1 million internally displaced in the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile, who are in a critical situation as a result of the denial of access by the government of Sudan to humanitarian assistance and the continuous aerial bombardment, which denied them farming and for a few of them, denied them the ability to harvest what they have cultivated.
The situation of more than a quarter of a million of externally displaced refugees and around a million internally displaced in the two areas is very critical. The SPLM-N calls on the African Union, United Nations and the international community to pay attention to this situation.
The SPLM-N is ever ready to implement the African Union resolutions and the UNSC Resolution 2046 to reach a humanitarian cessation of hostilities, which is needed now more than ever before to save the lives of the externally and internally displaced and to contribute positively in bringing stability to the border of Sudan and South Sudan, which is affected by the present crisis in the Republic of South Sudan, as well to help address the humanitarian situation all along the border.
