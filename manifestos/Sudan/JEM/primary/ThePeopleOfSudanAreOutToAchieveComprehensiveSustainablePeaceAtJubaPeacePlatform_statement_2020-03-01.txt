By Mahmoud A. Suleiman
TheDecember 19th2018 Glorious RevolutionaryPeople of Sudan have great hope fraught with some caution about what is going on in the platform of theCity of Juba,the Capital of theSisterly Republic of South Sudan forthe PeaceNegotiations. At the same time, the Sudanese people value some negotiation outcomes between theArmedStruggleForces(ASF)andMembers of the Transitional Sovereign Council(TSC). And the caution that was mentioned stems from thepastexperiences and outputs of previous negotiations, starting with theCities of N’Djamena and Abéché  in Chad, then Abuja, theCapital of Nigeria, followed by theCity of Tripoli, theCapital of Libya,The seat of the late Leader Muammar Gaddafi, may God have mercy on him, and finally to theCity of Doha, theCapital of the Gulf State of Qatar,all ofwhich unfortunately did not come Withany tangible well-negotiated ComprehensiveSustainablePeaceAgreementsthataddress and learn theRoots of theConflicts andthe Crises that resulted from their pains, and thefinalresult is what the DarfurRegion and itscivilian Sudanese Citizenshave been sufferingUntilTodayand Since the outbreak of the armedRevolutionand Darfur rebels took up to armsin 2002in response to and when the Arrogant Warmonger, the then Génocidaire Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, declared that his Islamist Regime Would Neither listen  nor Negotiate with the ones who did not currying arms, asHehad cometoPowerinto Sudanthrough theBarrel of theGun– aka Militarycoup d’etat.
At this pivotal juncture,we will now return to evaluating some attitudes towardsPeace in Sudan, which has suffered from wars and whose people aspireforpeaceto make carrying arms something of the pastDark daysthat werefull of pessimism andwoes.Now the slogan must be peace first and foremostandatall the time, everywhere, in aFree andJustDemocratic Sudan. This is more so especially there is power and desireto bring peace.Peace is a blessingand under this we canassuredly say the following:

* The Peace agreement is an opportunity to the correct some of the probable unintended mistakes of the Transitional Period.
* We are on the Verge of Signing Various Peace Agreements in the post-December 19th2018 Glorious Revolution in Sudan.
Peace Negotiations in the city of Juba, the capital of the Republic of South Sudan, on its multiple tracks remain at the admiration and confidence of the Sudanese people who aspire to stability and a decent life in the shadow of the three slogans of the 19thDecember 2018 Glorious Popular Revolution of  freedom, peace and justice.
Peace is indivisible, given the Victories achieved in Juba that included the Goodwill Agreement for the release of some Prisoners of War (POW) belonging to  the Sudanese Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) from the Huda Prison and other Prisons and the signing of the agreement for the share of the Negotiations on the path of the region of Darfur in the western Sudan, which took place in the City of Juba, the Capital of  the Republic of South Sudan, the location of the negotiations   with respect to The Darfur Region’s Share at the  division of  the Government Sudan jobs, in addition to our heartfelt happiness that  our brothers in the Republic of South Sudan reaching a consensus and resolving the disputes and their Sublimation above differences in opting for Peace and the well-being of their fellow citizens along with  their conclusion by paying of the Peace dues and the agreement of each of them to accept the  state positions offered; thus making us in Sudan very happy. Our happiness has beendoubled by the release of the Prisoners of Conscience or the Prisoners of War (POWs) which is one of the most important elements of Peace after the prolonged suffering caused by the absurd Wars of attritionthat has been waged for Seventeen odd years by the warmonger Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir who committed the most heinous crimes which included genocide against civilian Sudanese citizens in the Darfur region. This Omer al-Bashir was supported by the elements in the National Congress Party (NCP) regime and shared him in committing the crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of genocide and being indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague in the Netherlands since the year 2009 and remained fugitive. His deplorable entourage of Abdelrahim Mohammed Hussein, Ahmed Muhammed Haroun, Ali Osman Mohammed Taha and Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman, commonly known asAli Kushayb, is a senior Janjaweed commander supporting the Sudanese government against Darfur rebel groups, and as of June 2019, is sought under an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court (ICC) are as well involved in committing the foregoing heinous crimes against humanity, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and genocide and remain at large.
Itis a known documented fact thataround two million people are currently displaced inside Sudan,as (IDPs)while more than 650,000 Sudanese refugees live in neighbouring countries – including Chad and South Sudan. Some 300,000 refugees fromtheDarfurregionare currently living in 12 UNHCR and government run camps in Eastern Chad.

Eric Reevesreporting on the size of Darfurian refugees in Eastern Chad  said: “Darfur Refugees in Eastern Chad: The Most Invisible Casualties of the Darfur Genocide “Hundreds of thousands of African/non-Arab Darfuris remain trapped as refugees in twelve main camps in eastern Chad, unable to return because of the massive insecurity that continues to prevail in most of Darfur—insecurity that will only increase with the severe reductions in the UN/African Union “hybrid” Mission in Darfur (UNAMID). On June 30, 2017 the UN Security Council renewed the mandate for UNAMID, but—at Khartoum’s behest—reduced the military presence in Darfur by 44 percent and the police presence by more than 30 percent”.https://sudanreeves.org/2017/08/08/darfur-refugees-in-eastern-chad-the-most-invisible-casualties-of-the-darfur-genocide/

This article besides its timeliness, it also indicates and shows this author’s obsession withPeace; that is understandable asPeace represents the safe gate for livelihood for any human kind on the globe.
Thisis aReview and/or a political exploratory articlethatcomesagainst a backdrop of browsing the article written by Mohammed Nour Oudo under the title: “Peace is coming from Juba, which has been embracing the negotiations of the Sudanese factions since late last year. Peace is beginning to appear waving positive statements by the delegations participating in the negotiations. These positive statements issued every day by the leaders of the Armed Struggle Movements, the delegation of the Transitional Government, the leaders of the Sudanese political parties and the mediation committee in the state of South Sudan have entered reassurance in the hearts of the Sudanese people, the Sudanese street is optimistic about achieving peace soon.

Go ahead, Sudanese people, the platform of Juba will achieve comprehensive peace
Ustaz Mohamed Nour Oudo is among the permanent and active columnists who is staunchly adhered to the cause of the Sudanese Darfurians and belongs to the membership the Sudanese Justice and Equality Movement (JEM). UstazMohamed Nour Oudo indicates with confidence that Peace is coming from Juba, which has been embracing the negotiations of the Sudanesefactions sincelate last year. Peace is beginning to appear waving positive statements by the delegations participating in the negotiations. These positive statements issued every day by the leaders of the Armed Struggle Movements (ASM), the delegation of the Transitional Government (TG), the leaders of the Sudanese Political Parties and the Mediation Committee in the Republic of South Sudan. Moreover, he says that the Peace Negotiations have entered reassurance into the Hearts of the Sudanese People who have beenlonging for a comprehensive sustainable Peace that addresses the roots of the chronic Sudanese crises that have been delaying the progress of the country since the Dawn of Independence on January 1, 1956 from the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium.
He reiterates that Comprehensive peace is the dream of every Sudanese citizen after living through the wars that led to displacement, migration into the nowhere around the globe, seeking asylum since the colonizer’s exit, and after the fall of the National Congress Party (NCP) regime – AKA Rescue Government- that was trading in the Sudanese problem through false negotiations and fragile agreements. That is why we find the determination and seriousness of the leaders of the Armed Struggle Movements (ASM) and the Transitional Government led by the Prime Minister, Dr. Abdalla Hamdok to reach a ComprehensivePeace that brings back Sudan to the forefront of countries of the World, after it has been dwarfed for thirty years by the defunct National Islamic Front (NIF) /National Congress Party (NCP) regime led by thegenocidal criminal Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir.
The Juba platform is not a platform for negotiations for a job or partnership of a dictatorial government that came to power with a military coup. Rather, it is a platform for solving the Sudanese problem by addressing the root causes of the problem and dealing with them permanently and laying the foundations for the management of Sudan’s rule in the future. Lieutenant General Salva Kiir Mayardit and his government salute the mediation team, delegates from the international community and peace partners for their valuable efforts.
The gathering of the people of Sudan in their second homeland, the state of South Sudan, in a round table is not just for meetings between different parties politically, and they disperse without reaching a result or peace as some think, but to discuss solving the Sudanese problem in a transparent, sincere dialogue, earnestly, and with determination, putting the interest of the homeland in the eyes of their eyes.
The Sudanese people have benefited, and the negotiating parties in Juba have benefited from past experiences from previous negotiations and agreements that did not bring peace, stability, or security, so they do not want to repeat the past. Peace is everyone’s goal.
It isGood newsfor theSudanese peoplewho yearn for a decent life in peacewhich isinevitably comingsoon.
There is no war in Sudan after the platform in Jubafrom wherePeace will prevail throughout Sudan, and Sudan will enjoy stability, security and safetyand prosperity; optimists are saying.

* New Orbits: Juba (Sunday, February 23) *
Here the reader will be able to read through the following English translated version of important part of the article by Ustaz Yassir Arman:* New orbits: Juba (Sunday, February 23 2020) *In a special statement to the New Orbits Newspaper (the mouthpiece of the new forces of Sudan and the margin) issued by the popular movement, Ustaz Yasser Arman, head of the negotiating delegation, said: The solution to the current political crises and the production of a new project, it is better to take place through peace as a main entrance and peace is the gateway available to solve this Crises, adding that peace can solve key issues and can rearrange the papers of the current political scene and correct many of the mistakes that accompanied the transition process after the revolution, calling on everyone to work on producing a new project through the peace gateway and to prevent Sudan from collapsing because if it collapses It will collapse over all of our heads, including those dreaming of establishing ethnic mini-states, that Sudan can no longer tolerate conflicts, but rather positive competition, that the forces of change and revolution must reach a productive partnership that does not exclude the regular forces (army and rapid support). In this partnership the way out Adding ” We must be frank with our people and the forces of the revolution and the resistance committees until we reach the ports of the new project, and he stressed that the continued marginalization of wide powers of Sudanese and Sudanese, especially in the countryside, will not produce a new country or stability and that the marginalized will stop in the circle of protest without contributing to solutions and production of the new project It marginalizes marginalization and does not work to remove it. Those who call for the dismantling of Sudan and then rebuilding it are contributing and they must visit Libya, Iraq and Somalia. Peace provides a rare opportunity. We work to restore the productive face of the countryside by eliminating the costly rural wars as well as tackling resolving historical issues facing Sudan.We must all work to give the forces of the armed struggle a strategic way out to gradually transform into active political forces for the construction of Sudan. The development in social media and the revolution movement in our region and the role of peaceful action in the December revolution required the reconsideration of the armed struggle that depends on long-term rural wars And expensive in its human cost, which in its vast majority did not build democratic systems, and we must in the popular movement to work for a second birth to see the new Sudan, address the shortcomings and failures that are necessary for our experience and strive to establish a Sudanese union between two independent countries, the two countries of Sudan Not south.The division of the popular movement and the lack of coordination in the negotiating positions between the two parties are harmful to the two regions first and Sudan second, and we are ready for unity and coordination, and we will proceed with the peace project without hesitation.On the progress of the peace process hosted by the capital of the Republic of South Sudan (Juba), Ustaz Yasser Arman said, “The negotiations are now entering decisive and final stages and we in the popular movement and the Sudanese Revolutionary Front are ready to reach a final peace agreement by resolving the outstanding issues and they can be resolved,” and added, The agreement of the parties of the Republic of South Sudan and the swearing-in of the Vice-Presidents is also a new impetus and a positive factor that creates an appropriate regional climate, especially since negotiations on the peace process for Sudan are taking place in Juba, and he praised the difficult and historic decisions taken by the President of the Republic of South Sudan, Lieutenant-General Salva KiirMayar. At acceptance d. Riak referred to it, describing it as a cause for reflection to make concessions in order to end the war and achieve a comprehensive and just peace.On the meeting with the al-Burhan, Ustaz Yasser Arman said, “Yesterday, we met with the President of the Transitional Sovereignty Council, Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, and we had the meeting in a positive atmosphere and a good atmosphere, that both al-Burhan and General Hamidti showed a clear desire to reach a final peace agreement.” He added: We also ask the government to send a number of Ministers in the crucial stages of negotiations because their absence is not beneficial to the negotiation process, and we hope that the reason for their failure to attend is for good reasons.On the importance of signing the peace agreement, Ustaz Arman said, “We believe that the peace agreement will contribute to the dismantling of the NCP state and its regime, and will build a new security sector with a new military doctrine and will contribute to the reform of the economy and foreign relations.” Yasser Arman welcomed the current dialogue between the Sudanese Revolutionary Front and the Forces for Declaration of Freedom and Change (FFC), and called for the establishment of a partnership between all the forces of the Revolution and change to make the transitional period succeed and reach a democratic system.http://www.sudanile.com/index.php/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1/122933-%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%85-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D9%81%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%83-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A8%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%A9-%D9%8A%D8%AC%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B6%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B9-%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%82-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B6%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B7%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9
The word Peace is mentioned in the glorious Qur’an7times and more importantly is that the Word “Salam” in Arabic which means Peace is among the 99 Names of God Almighty (Allah, SWT), According to a hadith, there are at least 99 Names of Allah, known as the ʾasmāʾullāhi l-ḥusnā or the Beautiful Names of Allah and The names are also called 99 Attributes of Allah.

Thus, Peace is a blessing and a way for a person to be assured of the disappearance of fear and a guarantee of preventing hunger. This has been mentioned in Surat Quraish No. 106 in the Noble Qur’an in verse No. 4, which means by Translation of the Text: “He who has Fed them against Hunger and has made them Safe from Fear.”This is aGreat truth of God.
