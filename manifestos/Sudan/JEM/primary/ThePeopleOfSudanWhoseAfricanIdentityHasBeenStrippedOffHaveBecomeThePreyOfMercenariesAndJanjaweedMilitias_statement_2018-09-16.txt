The Janjaweed bandits have been raging in the land of Darfur in particular and Sudan in generalwithcorruption,havocand destruction, more than a decade on.TheJanjaweedmilitias and their allied mercenaries aretime bombthatwill explode sooner or later in the face of everyone.And through the follow-upof the TVepisodes under the titleof“thewitnessforthe recent era,late Dr.HassanAbdallaal-Turabi, the godfather of the former National Islamic Front (NIF)said of the strategiesofthe formerNational Salvation Revolution(NSR) was thedismantlingand dispense with theSudan Armed Forces (SAF)and replace it with irregular forces, akaJanjaweed militias and their ilk mercenaries.And they have donethat throughthe promotion of the Janjaweedmilitiasinstead of the Sudanese army forces(SAF). Therefore, itis very certain that the owners of criminalminds andthought will be their replacement gang of thieves.The name Janjaweed strikes fear into the hearts of many Sudanese people. TheJanjaweedisnow formally known as the Rapid Support Forces(RSF). Itfirstgained international notoriety in 2003 at the beginning of the Darfur conflict. Today, the Janjaweed are being accused of new violations – accusations that their leaders and the Sudanese government strongly deny.
The Janjaweed established their presence on the Sudanese political scene very quickly. They are associated with the Sudanese Armed Forces(SAF), fighting alongside them in the Sudanese states of the Blue Nile and South Kordofan, as well as in the Darfur region.
“Armed militias settled in our lands, they occupied all our farms and orchards. Who is going to remove them and give us or lands back if peacekeepers leave Darfur? We ask the UN to keep its forces in Darfur, there is still no peace.”
These are dispirited words of “DaoudJama,” a sixty-one-year-oldInternally Displaced Person (IDP)in the town ofMorneyin West Darfur, voicing concerns over plans to withdraw UN blue helmets from the region.

The statements of Mohammed Hamdan Duglu,knownfamouslyasHamiditi, commander of the Janjawid militia, which was recently namedasthe Rapid Support Forces(RSF), indicate the degree ofarrogance,superiority and slander that the tribal militias have reachedintheircontemptofSudanin general and particularlyin thesorrowfulDarfur region.

The former Janjaweed militia has gone through many stages to reachthelevel of the position that it iscurrently inwithin the circle of the regime of the National Congress party (NCP) under the name of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) after going through the cloning process and under the direct authority and Command of the Génocidaire, WarCriminal andPerpetrator of CrimesagainstHumanity against theRightsof theunarmed noncombatantSudaneseciviliancitizenspopulations in Darfur,Marshall Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, who remains fugitive from the international justice and chased by the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague in the Netherlands since 2009.One ofthe ironiesand themiserablefateof peoplein thisdecadenterais whathavebeen reportedasto havebeensaidbythe leader of the Janjaweed militia Mohammed Hamdan Dogolo,betterknown as Hamidati.
