This article comes against the backdropoftherecent statementsby Omer al-Bashirthat the responsibility for the destruction of thepublicproperty of the Sudan lies with the Sudanese people who rose up on 19 December 2018 and continuedsince thento lead to the elimination of dictatorship and the restoration of freedoms and democracy and the elimination of the causes of futile wars and suffering and the building of the rule of law andgoodgovernancealongJustice, and equalityamong all components of the Sudanese people with identityof being a Sudanese Citizen irrespective of colour,creedand genderaway from ethnicorigin, regionalaffiliationor mother tongue, etc.
In the midst of fear and anxiety about his fate, Omer al-Bashir is losing his temper and is trying to justify the ferocity of his criminal security apparatus, which shoots live bullets at peaceful protesting citizens and describes them as saboteurs and groups driven by foreign hands and groups of armed movements from Darfur came from Israel to create instability Of the Sudan.
In the midst of fear and anxiety about his fate, Omar al-Bashir is losing his temper and is trying to justify the ferocity of his criminal security apparatus, which shoots live bullets at peaceful protesting citizens and describes them as saboteurs and groups driven by foreign hands and groups of armed movements from Darfur came from Israel to create instabilityof the Sudanwhile there is strong evidence that his regime allowed the passage of Israeli air traffic through Sudan on its way to Brazil, as well as more secret deals agreements between the Bashir regime and Israel during the presence of the former Sudanese Foreign Minister before his dismissal, which helped in the decisiontakingof the new USPresident Donald Trumpexecutive ordersto lift economic sanctionson what is referred to as theFiveTractEngagementPlan(5 TEP)whenthe United States has decided to formally revoke a number of economically focused sanctions on Sudan in recognition of the Government of Sudan’s sustained positive actions in“alleged”five key areas.https://www.aljazeera.net/knowledgegate/opinions/2017/10/9/%D8%A3%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86
The 5 areas included:first, to maintain a cessation of hostilities in the areas of its internal conflict, including Darfur and what we refer to as the two areas, the states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile;second, to improve humanitarian access across Sudan;third, to end destabilizing activity in South Sudan;fourth, to build and deepen U.S.-Sudan cooperation in countering terrorism; andfifth, improving regional security with a particular focus on countering Joseph Kony and the Lord’s Resistance Army.Bearing in mind that Bashir’s regimewill remain on the state sponsors of terrorism list.Thefive-track engagement plan began in June of 2016.One of the most important conditions for the lifting oftheprolonged sanctionson the Bashir’s regimeincludingthe five basic conditionsis that Sudan fully complies with all the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution requirements regarding North Korea.Sudan said on Wednesday it had cut all defence ties with North Korea, in a rare admission that it used to have such ties in the first place.
The Khartoum Regime Hosted the World’s Most Barbaric Militia the Lord’s Resistance Army led by the Ugandan Joseph Kony, who is wanted for war crimes, has escaped capture for more than two decades. His rebel Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) is notorious for abducting thousands of children to use as soldiers or sex slaves.https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mia-farrow/khartoum-regime-hosts-the_b_497949.html?guccounter=1
The announcement came as Washington is locked in a standoff over Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear weapons programmes, and as Sudan, which is still on the USlist of state sponsors of terrorism, reels from an economic crisis.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-north-korea/sudan-says-it-has-cut-all-defence-ties-with-north-korea-idUSKCN1J22BU

In the context of the debate on the issue of sanctions, there has been a remarkable discovery in theIsraeli presssince the beginning of last year, six months before the start of secret negotiations between Khartoum and Washington and the outcome of the five tracks to lift the sanctions. This issue, which Israel discussedwithWashington to reward Khartoum to ease the pressure on them, and encourage the European Union countries to alleviate the debt burden thatdevastates the economyofthe SudantheIsraeli offers have raised many questions about their motives and circumstances.
After clarifying the relationship between the ruling regime and Omar al-Bashirandthe State of Israel, al-Bashir should not accuse the Darfur studentsintheSudanese universities of coming from Israel to incite people to the uprising, knowing that the students who were arrested by the security services canneitheraffordtogomenor come from Israel.The charge was avindictive one.It is partof theangerdirected by Omer al-Bashir against the Sudanese citizensintheDarfurregionwhom Bashirconsiders themtheinitiatorsforhis indictmentbytheInternational Criminal Court(ICC)atThe Hague in the Netherlands for his arrest and trial for the crimes hehascommitted against the Sudanese civilian citizens,that includeCrimes against humanity, war crimesand genocide and Bashir is still fugitive from theinternationaljustice.
TheNational Congress Party) NCP)governmentled by the military dictator Omer al- Bashirignored theforegoing facts of the matter and insteadcalls onthe Sudanese politicaloppositionfactionsto get ready forhis alleged2020 elections!http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article66877
Al-Bashir’s the foregoing statement challenging defiantly the Sudanese Political Position inspire theNovember 25,2017formalannouncement byaleading figure at Sudan’s ruling National Congress Party (NCP)whohas ruled out that President Omer al-Bashir would agree to amend the constitution in order to run for the office again, given the fact thatAl-Bashir’s term ends in 2020 and he couldn’t run for office again according to the constitution. However, some voices within the NCP and the government have recently called for amending the constitution to allow him to run for the presidency again.Nevertheless anddespite all the above, theMajority-ownedParliament of the ruling National Congress Party(NCP)has amended the 2005 transitional constitution of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement(CPA)and decided to nominate Omer al-Bashir in the 2020 elections.Without ashred ofdoubt, the winner of the presidential electionsin 2020will be Omer al-Bashir, taking into account the degree of fraudand poll riggingthat was inherent to the previousPresidential elections under the rule of the Islamic Movement in Sudanover the past three decades.All of theforegoing describedefforts by Bashir and his arbitrary regime are to ensure that Omer al-Bashir is protected from arrest by the International Criminal Court(ICC)orworsethat he is tried locally by the people of Sudan under the law of transitional justice, which all dictators fear.
Political observers and analysts believe that the political history of similar countries, some of which are adjacent to the Sudan, believe that the ruling regime of Omer al-Bashir has become close to full collapse andin its final demisel when theunderlyingreasons are read andanalysed.  They believeit is a matter of time and the government of Bashir will collapse if the people’s demonstrations continue without interruptionasthey arenowtaking placein all parts of the country. The protests continueas occurred in the October 21, 1964Revolution, andApril 1985‘Intifada’Revolution. The anger of the Sudanese people has been accumulating for three decades and has continued to boil not only as a result of the lack ofa loaf of abread, the lack of fuel for cooking, petrolfor cars,or difficulty withdrawingonesfundsfromBankaccounts as it is currently, butit is more than all that, it isas a result of arbitrary laws,unfaithfinancialsituation,crimes against humanity,war crimes andgenocide along with arbitrarysuppression of public freedoms, racism, nepotismand chronic blockage of the horizon of living inaddition to institutionalisedgeneral corruptionandthe licensing of corruption by religious fatwasadopted by religious sheikhs– clerics –loyal to the ruling regime, as well as the application of laws to target women with the punishment of flogging with whipsunder the infamous  arbitrary laws known as Public Order LawArticle 152 of the Criminal Codewheremore than 40,000 public order casesissuedannually inKhartoum, theSudanesecapital.According to the Sudan Democracy First Group (SDFG), the Sudanese Public Order Law is meant to oppress and dominate the population.The articles and provisions of the Law are specifically formulated in vague language, to give the police and the courts a free hand in its implementation, the SDFG says. The Law also gave the Public Order Police the powers of intrusion in private domains to enforce its articles.
Article 152 of the Criminal Code, on indecent clothing, is a good example of the vague definitions in the Law. The article does not set a concise definition of what constitutes ‘indecent clothing’. Thus, the application of this Article depends on the personal judgement of the arresting police officer.
