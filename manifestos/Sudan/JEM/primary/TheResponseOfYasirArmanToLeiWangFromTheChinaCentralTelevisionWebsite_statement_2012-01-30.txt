The Response of Yasir Arman to Lei Wang from the China Central Television WebsiteThe following was posted by Yasir Arman, the Secretary General of the SPLM-N, on the SPLM-N Facebook page in response to a question posted by Lei Wang from the China Central Television website.The SPLM-N is a national liberation movement that seeks democracy, just peace, equal citizenship and social justice.  It has been attacked by the dictator General Omar al-Bashir who is indicted by the international criminal court and who displaced more than half a million citizens of Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile, banned the SPLM-N, committed war crimes, and denies access to humanitarian assistance.  SPLM-N has nothing against China and the Chinese, and it is part of the forces that are looking for peace, stability, and co-existence worldwide.  The leadership of the SPLM-N and I, the Secretary General, together with the SPLM-N Chairman are exerting the maximum effort to obtain accurate information from our forces in the field regarding the Chinese who were detained in Southern Kordofan.  If it is SPLA-N forces that the Chinese citizens are with, be assured that they will be in safe hands and they will be released.  What we stand for before and after this incident are democracy and a just peace.  This should be better understood by China and that the National Congress government of General Bashir is a government that will never deliver good relations between Sudan and China.  They are massacring and committing war crimes against the Sudanese people and therefore they cannot sustain relations with any country in the world.  The interests of China and the international community are better served by the democratic forces in Sudan.  We are right now in contact with Beijing through one of the SPLM-N’s associates in Bejing to assist in resolving this situation.  – Yasir Arman, Secretary General, Sudan People’s Liberation Movement North, January 29, 2012
