The Second April 6th Revolution is definitely on the Way despite the Bullets of the Assassins!!
By Mahmoud A. Suleiman
TheGloriousApril 6Second Sudanese Revolution is a true revolution and not the Aprilfool’sDay asrumored by the allies of the current National Congress Party regime media.This Revolutionis alsonotstirred up byagents of foreign forcesasrumored in the corridors of the rulingregime of theNational Congress Party(NCP)led by thegenocidal criminal, thefugitivefrom the International JusticeOmer HassanAhmedal-Bashir and his hatefulcriminalcorruptentourage.
This article comes against the backdrop of the ongoing uprising of the disenfranchised Sudanese peoplewhich entered its one hundred and six days in a row andcoincidingwith the thirty-fourth anniversary of the popular April 6, 1985 revolution, which was launched by thedisenfranchisedSudanese people and overthrew the arbitraryMay 25thregime of themilitarydictatorMarshallJa’far Muhammad Nimeiri.
The arbitrary Nimeiri era haswasted ninevaluableyears of the life of the Sudanese peopleunder oppression and the imposition ofthe infamous lawsknown as theShariyalaws of September, which allowed extrajudicial killings and amputation of the limbs of the legs and handsfortheallegedly incrimination ofdrinking alcohol. Those Shariya Laws were masterminded by the thenthe National Islamic Front (NIF), a pseudonym for the International Muslim Brotherhood Movement (MBM), its branch in Sudan that cooperated with the ruling regime of the so-called May 25 Revolution led by Jaafar al-Nimeiri. However,
thesame National Islamic Front, which was part of the democratic system in Sudan, had plotted to overthrow a democratically elected government headed by Mr. Sadiq al-Mahdi on June 30, 1989, imposed arbitrary laws and continued torule with an iron fist in the name of Islam.But their behaviour and their actions of financial corruption,hypocrisy,lying, arbitrary repression, perpetrating crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide against defenseless Sudanese civilian citizens in the region of Darfur and elsewhere in the vast country, were against the religion of mercy Islam, which means peace and justice.Thus, the people who are continuing uprising and demonstrating since the 19thDecember 2018 had suffered from the crimes committed by Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir and his Islamism regimeentourageover the past lean three decades in the form of injustice, corruption,  lack of freedom have been chanting: “Freedom, Peace, Justice and revolution is the people’schoice”with aim of ousting the regime leading to its demise and to remain buried in the dustbin of stinking history with its ilk and  likes.
In the face of this victoriouspopularrevolution, the ruling regime of the National Congress Party(NCP)has been floundering to find a way out of its own impasse. Omar al-Bashirbegan talkingabout the need to pay attention to theneeds ofyouth sectorinaddition tohistalk about theso-called “NationalDialogue”,which the people of Sudanrejected outright and labeled itthe‘Jumpdialogue’mockingly!
Moreover, the mass media outlets surfaced that Marshall Omer al-Bashir has prepared his boring series of talks on Friday 5thof April 2019 addressing it to the uprising people of Sudanatthe Republican Palacein Khartoum,the Capital of Sudanat 7:00 pm.However, theRevolution of the disadvantaged and the marginalized majority of the population of the rest of Sudanwho are remaining in the countryafterthe (NCP) regimeforced one third ofthe people of Sudan in the south of the country to optforSecession and forming their own separate Republic of SouthSudan,distancing themselves from the racism they suffered at the hands of the racist bigots.Nevertheless, onSaturdaythe6thofApril 2019, wethe Sudanese willsay with all pride that the revolution is victorious despite the militias of the ruling regime;despite the mercenaries of Omer al-Bashir, the peoplewillcontinue to demonstrate and protest andwouldnot stop fighting until they defeat Omer al-Bashir and his criminal entourage and salute the Sudanese people everywhere.At this juncture, we pay tribute to the Sudanese oppositioncomponents, both civil and Armed, representedby theGathering ofProfessionals and theForces ofFreedom andChangewhich carries with itonly OneNationalGoal, but no second,whichis thetoppling ofthecriminalruling regime of the National Congress Party(NCP), theone continued over the past three decades claimingof being the protector of theIslamic religion through the infamous terroristpolitical Islam, thatgave birth tothe notoriousmurderousentity what istermed theIslamicState in Iraq and Syriaaka (ISIS) or theIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant(ISIL).As the World knows theNational Islamic Front (NIF)was aSudanese political party founded in 1985 by the Sudanese Muslim BrotherhoodMovement (MBM)in collaboration with Jafar al-Numayri.
Unfortunate for the peaceful Sudanese people, their country Sudanwashaunted by thefateful coming of the InternationalMuslim BrotherhoodMovement (MBM)andhas beenvery soonconsidered and labeled asstate sponsor of terrorism by theUnited States of America (US)government since 1993, and was targeted by United Nations(UN)sanctions in 1996 for its role in sheltering suspects of an attempted assassination of Hosni Mubarak, president of Egypt. Sudan has been suspected of harboring members of the terrorist organizationsincludingAl-QaedaofOsama Ben Laden,Hezbollahwhich isa group of Lebanese Shiite clerics formed Hezbollah with the goal of driving Israel from Lebanon and establishing an Islamic state there,TheIslamic Resistance MovementHamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Abu Nidal Organization,Jamaat al-Islamiyya the radical group that seeks to install an Islamic regime in place of the secular Egyptian government., and the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, as well as supporting insurgencies in Ugandasuch asLord’s Resistance Armyled byJoseph Kony,The Al-Nahda (“renaissance” or “revival”) movement in Tunisia, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Eritrea.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-sponsored_terrorism
In1991,theNational Islamic Front (NIF) led by Hassan Abdalla al-Turabifounded the Popular Arab and Islamic Congress (PAIC),an annual event that grouped together militant Islamist leaders from around the world, as referred to in the foregoing paragraph. Thus, Sudan became host to the leader of Al-Qaeda, which was based in Sudan in the period 1990-1996.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/sudan/turabi.htm
Thus, the Muslim Brotherhood Movement (MBM) has exploited the state of Sudan as a focal point for allinternationalIslamistterroristsgroups as well as other wanted Internationalterrorists such as  Ilich Ramírez Sánchez also known as Carlos the Jackal.https://www.google.com/search?q=the+vezawilian+terrorist+nicknamed+the+jackal&oq=the+vezawilian+terrorist+nicknamed+the+jackal&aqs=chrome..69i57.72081j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
The Islamic Movement,aka, the Muslim Brotherhood Movement (MBM)in Sudan has brought all types of woes to the Sudanese people during their autocratic rein over the past three decades. Now time is ripe for the people of this fractured country Sudan to work hard together and faithfully united against one common enemyto get rid of it once for all. The revolutionaries believe that this goal can be achieved through thePopularSecond Sixth April Revolutionon Saturday April the 6th2019 when all the citizens from all parts of Sudan will be uprising and peacefully chanting the nationwideongoingslogans of the Revolutionin all demonstrations:“Freedom,peace and justice:Revolution is the choice of the people”!The world’s attention goes on towards Saturday the6thApril2019, as the most important Sudanese event inside Sudan and abroad, the historic processions willbe organizedby the Sudanese peopleinsidethe Sudanese inthe Diaspora abroadto support the struggles of the Sudanese people andaiming as wellmobilizingforeigndiplomaticmissions, International Community decision makersandgaming Mass MediaSupport for the Sudanese revolution.The fall of the gang of the ruling National Congress Party(NCP)led by genocidalcriminal Omer al-Bashir is just around the cornerwith a bit of unitedharshknockout, where it will benofurtherChance for recovery.

“The people of Sudanwant to overthrow the regime»and“JustDown withit”remains theicon of the Sudanese revolutionslogan: Tasgot Bas!! And Lick Your Elbow!!Moreover, we repeat the slogan: “Tasgot Bass”because the regime has given up a dear part of the Sudanese homeland in the Halayeb area inEastern Sudanto Egyptas a price for the assassination attempt on former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and abandoned the region ofFashagato Ethiopia for fear of preservingthethroneof Omer al-Bashir. All of thoselands aregenuinepart of the land ofour motherland ofGreater Sudan, which is characterized by multiculturalism and ethnicity.
The Sudanese people’s proverb says to the person who despises his family but inreality heisacowardly in the face of the enemies:The Proverb goes: “ He is alion against us, but during the wars he isascowardlyasan ostrich!Thus, we find such behaviour has been repeated by Omer al-Bashir and his Army of militias and mercenaries. Homeland is a sacrosanct and a true citizen should stand steadfast in the defense of one’s Homeland.
John Fitzgerald “Jack”Kennedycommonly referred to by his initials JFK,theAmerican politician and journalist who served as the 35thPresident of the United Statesof Americafrom January 1961 until his assassination in November 1963, has been quoted as saying:“Ask not what your country can do for youbutask what you can do for your country”.http://www.thegoldenquotes.com/quote-categories/motherland-quotes/

Last and not the least; the regime must come to its Downfall whether like it or not;because many of our people havelosttheirlives for the sake ofthepopular Revolution of December2018, which continues so far.Therehavebeen fifty-two martyrsasthe victims of theNational Congress Party (NCP)regimewhichstill clings to the throne of power on the bodies of those honorablemartyrs.
