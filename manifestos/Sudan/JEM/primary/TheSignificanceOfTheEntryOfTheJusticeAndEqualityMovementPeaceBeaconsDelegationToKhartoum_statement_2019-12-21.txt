The Significance of the Entry of the Justice and Equality MovementPeaceBeacons’ Delegation to Khartoum
By Mahmoud A. Suleiman
The Entry of the Peace Beacons of the Justice and Equality Movement to Khartoum is a Turning Point
The Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) previously entered the Sudanese Capital Khartoum in the Operation Long Arm (OLA) andtodayitentersitfor the sake of Long-term Just Peace
The entry of theSudaneseJustice and Equality Movement (JEM)Peace Beacons’Delegationto Khartoum onSaturday the 7thofDecember 2019 bringsback thememories of its entry to the Three-Town Capital Khartoum onSaturday10thMy 2008 under the banner of Operation Long Arm (OLA)led by its late founding leader, Dr. Khalil Ibrahim Muhammed.It isNoteworthy that the Sudan Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) entered Khartoum during this time in quite different circumstances, mainly to herald a Just sustainable Peace for all the regions of Sudan after the 19thDecember 2018 Glorious all Sudanese people Revolution after the ouster of the National Congress Party (NCP) regime of the Deposed Genocidal President Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir and his criminal corrupt hypocrite Islamism entourage.
According to the Sudan Tribune Cyber Journal:  On “December 19, 2019 (KHARTOUM) – Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in the capital, Khartoum, and other states, on Thursday, to mark the first anniversary of the revolution that toppled down the 30-year regime of the former President Omer al-Bashir in April 2019.The demonstrators whoweregathering in the centre of Khartoum chanted slogans such as “Free revolutionaries … We will carry on the journey”, “Freedom  PeaceandJustice … Revolution is the choice of the people”,” The people want revenge for the martyrs” as others chanted against the military and called for the lifting of the immunity of those involved in the killing of the protestersat the Sit-In site in front of the Sudanese Army Headquarters on the 3rdJune 2019 and during the Holy Month of Ramadan.https://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article68728
This article coincides with theapproaching  of the desiredsustainable peace thatneeded bythe Sudanese people whotasted the scourge of wars waged by arbitrary ruling regimes against citizens whowere demandingtheir rights offreedom, peace and justice which are the slogans of thecurrent GloriousPopular SudaneseDecember 19, 2018Revolution. And through this article, it occurred  to me to include in listing some of the history of the armed struggle movements for liberation from the clutches of the internal colonialism, which refusedthatand denied to give the basic citizenship rights represented in the fair distribution of power and wealth among the citizens of one country withoutfavouring specific party above the citizens in the marginalized regions such as Darfur, Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan, South Blue Nile Ingassana, Bejja people in the Red Sea and Eastern Sudan and those in the far Northern Nilotic regionas itcontinued happeningduring the era of Dictatorialregimesspearheaded by Military coup d’étatsin Sudan since  the departure of  the Anglo-Egyptian colonialism, aka,the CondominiumonSundaythe First of January 1956.
As they say that the presentis the implantation of the past and the futurereapingthe present and historyis theRecordoftime for the lives of peoples and nations. In this context at this moment,onethought of telling the history of the outbreak of theRevolution that triggered bytheso-called National Islamic Front (NIF) /National Congress Party (NCP)/ ruling regime’s denial of the legitimatecitizenship rights inthe region ofDarfur.When citizens of the Darfur region demanded the rights of citizenship represented in the fair distribution of power and wealth and the equal treatment of Sudanese citizens in rights and duties, the ruling regime of National Islamic Front (NIF), at the time in February 2003 said, threatening the representatives of the people of the region, it will not negotiate with anyone who is not taking up to arms because its regime came to the helm of Sudan through thebarrel of the gun.Story of the Darfur Uprisingbroke up inthe year2003when the very arrogantthe then Brigadier in the Sudan Armed Force (SAF) OmerHassan Ahmed al-Bashir said he would negotiate only with the one carrying up arms in Darfur.Thus, Omer al-Bashir’s statements were an explicit call to war.
As the history tells, this Omer al-Bashir, who used to be referred to as Omer Hassan among the Sudan Armed Force (SAF) military   ranks, heverysoon becameby default theleader of the June 30th1989 MilitaryCoup d’état, he granted himself the military rank of Field Marshal, which he did not deserve, bypassing four ranks to install himself Field Marshal. Thisunelected PutschistOmer Hassan has become the President of Sudan. The grandiose Field Marshall Omer HassanAhmed Al-Bashiracted as the Egyptian Pharoah.  In that, he does whatever he wanted to do;he passedarbitrary ordersand ruledwith an iron fist. And he made all the people of Sudanas his archenemiesat the timewhendear parts of Sudan’s land occupied by foreign neighbouring countries.
As they say in the popular saying that something reminds of something!It should be noted that today, Thursday, the nineteenth of December 2019, marks the first annual Anniversary  of the Glorious December 2018 Revolution for the people of Sudan who rose up on that day and toppled the ruling regime of the arbitrary National Congress Party (NCP) of the International Muslim BrotherhoodMovement, theFreemasonry Khartoum branch and now the former dictator Omer al-Bashir sits in Kober Prison In Khartoum, after,he was tried for the crime of financial corruptionwhen millions of US Dollars were found hidden in his house, but he awaits his punishment for the war crimes,  crimes against humanity,ethnic cleansing and crimes of genocide.Hehadcommittedthose heinous crimes against the civilian Sudanese citizensin the Darfur region.And that makes himto  spendthe rest of his life in The Hague prisons in the Netherlands according to the ruling issued against him by International Criminal Court (ICC); that happened whenin July 2008, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Luis Moreno Ocampo, accused al-Bashir of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in Darfur.The first warrant for arrest for Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir was issued on 4 March 2009, the second on 12 July 2010. The suspect is still at large, according to International Law.https://www.icc-cpi.int/darfur/albashir
The ICC prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, accuses Bashir of keeping 2.5 million refugees in Darfur in camps “under genocide conditions, like a gigantic Auschwitz”.

For nearly three decades Omar al-Bashir’s regime butchered and plundered. Since 2010 the former Sudanese president has evaded an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in the Darfur region. In Khartoum his Islamist government would flog women for wearing trousers and kill protesters in the streets. After he was ousted in a coup in April 2019, leaving behind an economy in crisis and a country awash with armed groups, many hoped he would spend the rest of his life behind bars.
On December 14th 2019 a Sudanese court convicted Mr Bashir, aged 75, of money-laundering and corruption after $130 million US Dollars was found in suitcases in his home. But he was sentencedonlyto two years in a “reform facility” after the court said he was too old to go to prison. One commentator in Sudan said it had, in effect, put him in a nursing home.https://amp.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/12/18/two-years-in-a-rest-home-for-sudans-former-tyrant

As the rationalSudanesesaying goes, a signal is sufficient for it to makesomeoneto understandthe intended purpose. Accordingly, the rebels in Darfur have understood the true intentions behind the statements of the brigadier general in the Sudanese army, Omer al-Bashir. The Motto that followed was: “Revolution is like the beard it does not end with repeated shaving”, a statement made by the first martyr of the Darfur Revolution,Simple words said by the founder and leader of the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) themartyr Abdullah AbbakerBashar. By saying so, MartyrAbdallaAbbakerBasharas though he wereas if he were following the steps of the Argentine militantMarxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat, and military theorist, ErnestoChe Guevara, the rebel who committed himself to the struggle for freedom and justice in the world, lived with a rifle and a backpack full of books, and when he said (armed struggle is the only revolutionary means capable of toppling a dictatorship).

As the rational saying goes, the signal is sufficient for it to be understood, and the rebels in Darfur have understood the true intentions behind the statements of the brigadier general in the Sudanese army, Omar al-Bashir. And the response of the armed rebels in Darfur was swift. They were composed of the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) and the Sudanese Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) – and after they got certain that it was inevitable to fight the war, they caused a swift painful blow to the airport in the city of El Fasher, the capital of the Darfur region, where the warplanes that were equipped to eliminate The revolution is in its infancy were landed.The rebels assaulted the landedwaaeroplanes.The outcome of the rebels’ raid ofEl-Fashir Airportwas by all assessmentsitacted asa volcanicblow.
According to historic documented reports indicated the following: on Sunday, 25 Safar 1424 AH, corresponding to April 27, 2003, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) spokesman announced in a joint press conference with the interior and media ministers, the success of the government forces in repelling the rebel attack on the Al-Fasher airport in the western Sudanese state of Darfur yesterday. Official data revealed the magnitude of the operation, which resulted in the destruction of four airports at the airport, the death of 32 government forces, including two officers, and the rebel death toll reached 20, but witnesses confirmed that there were heavy losses among government forces beyond the official numbers.https://www.albayan.ae/one-world/2003-04-27-1.1265711

Asreported earlier in this article, the conflict in the Sudan’s western region of Darfur erupted in February 2003 when ethnic African rebels took up arms against Omer al-Bashir’s Arab-dominated government, accusing it of marginalising the region economically and politically. Similar conflicts also erupted in SouthKordofan’s NubaMountains and Blue Nile region of Ingessana during theSecession of Sudan’s south from the north in 2011, aftera general Referendum.
“The chances of achieving comprehensive peace in the country have grown” since the revolution,said member the Sovereign Council to lead transitionMohamed al-Taayushi said.The Transitional Sovereign Council includes five members of the former Transitional Military Council (TMC) and will be headed by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who was already the head of the TMC.

Thus, achieving peace is crucial to the transitional government in Sudan. It has counted on ending the wars with rebels in order to revive the country’s battered economy through slashing the military spending, which takes up much of the national budget.
Sudanese authorities have introduced good-will signals. They dismissed death sentences against eight rebel leaders and released more than a dozen prisoners of war. They have also delayed the formation of the parliament and the appointment of provincial governors to allow time for the rebels to come on board. The government delegation, led by Gen. Mohammed Hamadan Dagalo, a member of the Sudan’s sovereign council, arrived in Juba late Sunday. Rebel leaders arrived earlier this month.
