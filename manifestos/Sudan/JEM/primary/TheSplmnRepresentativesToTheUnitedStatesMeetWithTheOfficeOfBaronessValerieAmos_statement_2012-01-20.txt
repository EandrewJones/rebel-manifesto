The displacement of the civil population of South Kordofan/Nuba Mountains and the Blue Nile States came as direct result of the Khartoum government policies of targeting the civilian population.6-    The SPLMN appreciates the tremendous efforts by the US Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, the United Nations Undersecretary General for Humanitarian Assistance Baroness Valarie Amos and the US special Envoy to Sudan Ambassador Princeton Lyman and look forward to see their efforts translated into action to address the sufferings of the IDPs.Anwar ElhajThe SPLMN RepresentativeUnited States, WashingtonJanuary 19, 2012
