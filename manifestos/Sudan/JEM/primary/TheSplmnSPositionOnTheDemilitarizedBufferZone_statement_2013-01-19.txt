The SPLM-N’s Position on the Demilitarized Buffer Zone
The SPLM-N leadership welcomes any agreement between the Republic of Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan that will lead to peace, tranquility and serve the interests of the peoples of the two Sudans, and in particular, the agreement on the demilitarized buffer zone between the two countries to establish peace.The establishment of a demilitarized buffer zone emphasizes the urgency and the necessity to include the SPLM-N in order to reach an effective demilitarized buffer zone given the fact that the SPLM-N controls more than 40% of the Sudan international border with the Republic of South Sudan that will entail the need of the consultations between the SPLM-N, the AUHIP, the Ethiopian Prime Minister, the United Nations and the other countries supporting the peace process.  The SPLM-N reiterates its readiness and willingness to cooperate in the interest of peace and tranquility of the border between the two countries, especially when it comes to securing the interests of the civilian population.  It is worth mentioning that the joint monitoring teams for the borders will include a military personnel from the Sudan government and without an agreement with the SPLM-N, it is only logical that the SPLM-N will welcome all the monitor personnel from the region, the international community and the United Nations in the area of our control minus the Sudan government military personnel who will have no place in our areas of control without ending the war or reaching an acceptable formula for both of us.  We welcome any consultations regarding this issue.
