This article comes against the backdrop of the recentnews mediaoutlet reportsthatthenewCabinet of the National Congress Party (NCP)regime is trying to find peace for the neighboring African countries while theformer National Islamic Front  (NIF) and its offspring the  National Congress Party (NCP) regime continued  Waging Wars of Attrition against Its Own Citizens and reneging  andfailing tohonour Peace Accords it has signed with the Partiesin Dispute and allowingSudanto bein warswith its peoplein the Darfur regionsince 2003.It has been surfaced in the news that the regime’s newForeign MinisterDirdiriMohamed Ahmed iscurrentlyonhis way as ofMonday15thOctober 2018tothe Capital and largest city of the Central African Republic (CAR)Banguiandto N’Djamena the capital and largest city of the Republic of Chad,carrying messages fromthe National Congress Party (NCP)PresidentMarshallOmerHassan Ahmedal-Bashir tohis counterpartsof theChadian President IdrissDébyand the President of Central African Republic,  Président de la République centrafricaine Faustin-Archange Touadéra.According to a statement issued by the Sudanese Foreign Ministry, which was read by Bag News, the visit comes within the framework of Sudan’s efforts to achieve peace in the Central African Republic(CAR)adopted by the African Union(AU).Furthermore, let us not forget the peace deal signed by the feuding groups of the Republic of South SudanofPresident Salva Kiir Mayardit withthemain rebel leaderDr.Riek Machar Teny Dhurgon in Khartoum inthe2018 inKhartoum where the National Congress Party (NCP) President Omer Al Bashir has offered to host peace talks .Nevertheless, the peace accord targeted at the time has yet to be archived, given the South Sudan’s bitter rivals President Salwa Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar.The IGAD-led peace mediation in South Sudanas all of us know, things didn’t go as expected.Now coming back to the topic which is the communal warfare that has been continuing since 2013whentheCentralAfricaRepublic (CAR)has slipped into a sectarian conflict in which the ChristianAnti-Balaka militias,the so-called “Silica” coalition, a political and military coalition with a Muslim majority, have been put to the fore.On April 10, 2014, the UnitedNationsSecurityCouncil(UNSC)approved the deployment of an international peacekeeping force of 12,000 troops in Central AfricaRepublic,shaken by a stifling sectarian crisis. TheUnited Nations has deployed a 12,000-strong force to stabilize the country, which was able to emerge from a transitional phase and hold presidential elections in early 2016.
Thus, Omer al-Bashir and his ruling regime mimic the story of a doctor who tries to cure sick patients while he issickerthan the patient himself!
There are signs, however, that the “Sick Man of Africa”, as Uganda was dubbed after a 20-year reign of terror by Milton Obote and Idi Amin, is well on the way torecovery.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/sick-man-of-africa-is-very-much-on-the-mend-1594060.htmlAt one time, Nigeria has also been given the labelof “Sick Man of Africa“https://nationalinterest.org/article/the-sick-man-of-africa-3345?page=0%2C1
Now Sudan under the30-yearreign of the National Congress Party (NCP)will qualify the title of the failed state the“Sick Man of Africa”,par excellence.http://www.gamji.com/article5000/NEWS5169.htm
According to the cyber journal Sudan Tribune that inLastSeptemberin a meeting held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, the African Union integrated the Sudanese initiative to end the armed conflict in the Central African Republic (CAR) between Muslim and Christian militias that continue to destabilize the country despite the deployment of a UN peacekeeping mission.http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article66426
At this juncture,there is a question posing itself as to whether there exists not a single wise head of state in all the African continent who could helpin  solvingthe chronic internal conflicts in the sisterly countries other than Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir who has  been indicted for crimes against humanity, war crimes and  genocide  against the Sudanese citizens in the Darfur region and remains fugitive from the international justice?
