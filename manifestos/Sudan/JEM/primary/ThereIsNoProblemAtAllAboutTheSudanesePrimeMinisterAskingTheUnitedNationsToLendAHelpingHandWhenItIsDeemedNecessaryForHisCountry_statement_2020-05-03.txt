By Mahmoud A. Suleiman
This article comes against the backdrop of a plethoraand overabundanceof events thattook placeinourSudan and the entire world recently.Nevertheless,Iwillstart initiating this article by congratulating theSudanese people in alltheregions of Sudan on the occasion of blessedMonth of Ramadanand Ihopewith sincerityfrom Almighty Allah, SWT, to accept our fasting in the manner that it pleases Him and protect us all from the Pandemic of the renewed Coronavirus(COVID – 19)that sweptand it hit the whole world. Accordingly and at this juncture, we all must follow the preventive health instructions and measures that include maintaining social distancing, washing hands with soap and water, not touching the face, using a handkerchief,tissue paper or ones sleeve if a tissue paper is not at handwhen sneezing, and throwing it intothe dustbin immediately after that.
Dearhonourable Sudanese people, as you know, inthe past few days we have lost two of the dearest sons of Sudan who have beenabsented bythe inevitable death that AlmightyGod haswrote to them.We pay our condolences to their families.The firstof thetwo isthelawyerUstazFarouk Abu Issa who will be remembered by the glorious Sudanese Revolution of October21, 1964.He will beremembered by those who are still aliveandwere participants in theGloriousRevolution; they remember very well the “Night of the Barricades”, when Ustaz Farouk Abu Issa, the then theSudanese GovernmentMinister of Information.Wealso askthe God’sMercy tolate Dr. Mansour Khaledwhowas aPolitician, writer,Author,diplomat, andarebel.Bothsons of Sudan havepassed away after years of giving and sacrificing for the sake of homeland of Sudan and its people. The two charactersthatI have referred to, without a shred of doubt,the people of Sudan will remember them as the loyalSudanesesons who have given so much for their people during their great struggles and the Sudanese people will remember them for generations to comein response to the sacrificesthetwo of themmade forthe sake ofSudan.
The request of being placed under the ChapterSeventh of the United Nations Charter is a right guaranteed by international law if itisdeemed necessityforthe concerned country like Sudan today.One sees no problem whatsoeverif it happens that the Prime Minister of Sudan Dr. Abdullah Hamdok, asked the United Nations(UN)to place the case of Sudan under Article Seven of the Charter of the United Nations.The question that imposes itself at such occasion is as to what is the problem if it happens that the Prime Minister of Sudan, Dr. Abdullah Hamdouk, asked the United Nations(UN)to place thedirecase of Sudan under Article Seven of theUnited NationsCharter, given the fact that Sudanhas been a member of the United Nations since12 November1956.Whatis going tohurtor harmSudan if it happens thatarequesthas been made bythe Prime Minister of Sudan, given the fact that the countryhas been suffering the effects of the wars ofattritionwagedsince 2003by thecurrentlyoustedaccursedregime leader Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashirandever since theSudanesenation continued tosufferfromextremepoverty and unable to meet the needs ofthecomplexPeacewhich is inneedof a hugefinancial support and international experience to exitfrom warto a sustainable just peacethatis extremely costly andcan only be achieved byasking the United Nations(UN)Organisation forplacing his country under the sixth clause of the aforementioned UN Charter.
One finds no  problem if it happens that the Prime Minister of Sudan, Dr. Abdullah Hamdok has  asked the United Nations  (UN) to place the case of Sudan under Article Seven of the Charter of the United Nations.  Sudan has been a member of the United Nations since 12 November 1956. What hurts Sudan if it happens that the request of the Prime Minister of Sudan who has been suffering the effects of the wars of exhaustion launched by the ousted ruling regime since 2003 and suffers from poverty and is unable to meet the needs of complex peace to need financial support and international experience to exit to the space of a sustainable and just peace where This can only be achieved by placing his country under the sixth clause of the aforementioned UN Charter. Thus, logical Questions will come in succession awaiting satisfactory answers.
Having saidthe foregoing,I would liketodelveintothe topicand the matterthathaspreoccupiedand caused a lot of concern to the Sudanese people for some time and has been spearheaded bya fewindividuals amongthe Sudanesesocietiesand subjectedthe communitiesinto afruitlessByzantinekind ofdebate.Moreover, thatconvolutedtype ofnarrative hasbeenorchestrated bythose who are gossip–loving, empty of content, tendingto wasteof time inblundering andkeepingpeople away from the things that matter to them.Those are thekindofindividualswho are described as the half-illiterate educationally   and scholastic dropouts at best, as indicated in the Sudanese vernacular. They tendresort to suchfruitless talk,showcasingandfillingthesocial mediaspheresespecially the WhatsAppwitha lotofmeaninglessdebates,around a subject they have created which isas to whyon earththeinterim SudanesePrime MinisterDoctorAbdallaHamdok chose to request the United Nations Security Council(UNSC)to put the current situation in Sudanwhich continueslanguishingSuffering the legacy left by elements of the toppled regimefor an urgent  help to place it under Chapter(VII)andafter the gloriousPopularRevolution of December 2018,where the components of Revolutionaries chanted forthree basic citizenship rights of Freedom, Peace and Justice during the days of their Revolution that overthrew the Génocidaire Marshall Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir and his corrupt entourage.As we know thatunder Chapter(VII) of the (UNSC) CharterSudan can fulfill the requirements ofPeace in all parts of Sudan, and we know very wellalsothat theChapter Seven(VII)of the (UN) Charteris available forall the193 countrieswho areMember Countriesto ask for when the conditions of their countries are nearing failure aftertheyhave suffered fromtheWar of attritionand whose surviving citizens have been languishing under harsh lives characterized bymany yearsofbeing Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)and in addition tothe refugees andasylumseekersalong with those who preferred The Diaspora existence away from being persecuted unjustly. This isthe case inthe Republic ofSudan even after thepopularoverthrow of theformer National Congress Party (NCP)regime, theaffiliate of the InternationalMuslimBrotherhoodMovement (MBM) entitychaired by deposed,dictator, who remainsfugitive from the international justice,theGénocidaireOmer Hassan Ahmed Al-Bashir.
Thepersonabout whom part of this article is concernedkept talking a lot withouta clearmeaning or benefit,accusing the Sudanese Prime Minister of trying to sell the sovereignty of our country to foreign former colonialistnationsthrough begginginan unsuccessful attempt togetthe kindness of thoseFive permanent members of theUnited NationsSecurity Council(UNSC), a matter which is close to national betrayal!What this person is talking about indicates his extreme ignorance and lack of familiarity with world politics and diplomacy. Unfortunately, we have to respond to his nonsensebecause his hear sayings have almost convinced some components of the Sudanese people who have no thorough  and full knowledge as to how the United Nations(UN)can offer helping hand to member nations when they are in dire need.
Thus,it has become one’s duty to respond tothe ongoing constant confusion that spins in the social mediaspheressuch as the ‘WhatsApp’ aroundthe United Nations (UN) Charter Chapters(VI)and(VII) requires somedetailedinformation for the sake of the public to havesome basic grasp ofknowledge about the functions of theUnited Nations (UN)Charter and itstwo foregoing Chapters.
One ofthe tasksofCHAPTER(VII)of theUnited Nations (UN) Charter is theACTION WITH RESPECT TO THREATS TO THE PEACE, BREACHES OF THE PEACE AND ACTS OF AGGRESSION. It is made up of a number of Articles starting with Article 39 and after series of articles ending in Article 51.For example, Article 39 states that the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) shalldetermine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.

Currently,Sudan is in urgent need of the United Nations(UN)efforts after achieving peace and the exit of the peacekeeping mission better  known as theUnited Nations–African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) for short, and the establishment of the special political missionthatprovides funding in its programs from the budget and the estimated budget considering that the mandate of theUnited NationsSecurity Council(UNSC)and this greatly helps in theDisarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration(DDR), orDisarmament, Demobilisation, Repatriation, Reintegration and Resettlement(DDRRR)besides removing mines and explosive objects as well On the return and resettlement of internally displaced persons(IDPs)and refugees, which are very costly operations.It should also be noted here that cooperation and coordination between special political missions and the United Nations(UN)system is an essential pillar in linking security issues and economic and social development issues, addressing the rootcausesof conflicts and assisting countries emerging from conflicts to build sustainable peace.And countries like Sudan, which emerged from wars that lasted for more than a quarter of a century, where there is no infrastructure and lacks the budget to support the livelihood of citizens, let alone finance support for building educational and health institutions and providing housing for returnees while providing drinking water sources.
It is also noteworthy that Private political missions generally summarize their competencies and mandate in preventing conflicts and assisting the parties emerging from the conflict such as Sudan to build sustainable peace, and this coordination has its (political) characteristic that is necessary as its name indicates, and these missions are dispatched based on the desire of the state concerned to implement the plans and programmes set by the countries according to their national needs.They range from, for example, peace promotion and maintenance, the use of good offices, promotion of reconciliations, mediation, facilitating negotiation between parties, assistance in conducting elections, avoiding conflicts associated with election results, and coordinating economic support. Donors and the provision of financial resources and the promotion of relevant peacebuilding issues of national capacity-building and empowerment of youth and women in establishing the concepts of a culture of peace and to help enable the rule of law and transitional justice and reform of the civil assistance service in the success of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) and mine clearance.
The mandate entrusted to special political missions stresses that national actors, including youth and women, can address the needs and goals of their societies in a sustainable manner and are better informed than those of the international employee. In order to achieve national ownership, special political missions work with national patrons (ministries, bodies, and councils represented in the National Commission), each in its area of ​​competence to implement priorities, enhance local capabilities, and implement what is agreed upon with them.Furthermore,it should also be noted that political missions are characterized by their ability to respond quicklyto deal with developments in the field of peacebuilding and maintenance and the ability to absorb the changes on the ground and for this they are ready to respond quickly to achieve long-term gains in the areas of peace promotion, without a threadof doubtSudan is in a dire need of such support.
And at this juncture we have to acknowledge and appreciatethat the partnership with regional and sub-regional organizations constitutes the cornerstone for the success of political missions and we have our experiences in cooperation between the African Union(AU)and the United Nations(UN), and therefore the partnership between them can continue at the stage of the special political mission, and in such cases the United Nations provides Strengthening capacities and technical assistance for the regional partner, Sudan, which is a founding member of the African Pan-African Organization, the former Organisation of African Unity (OAU)established on 25 May 1963 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with 32 signatory governments.

Following is the text of Secretary KofiAnnan’smessage for the new millennium:
“Today, we celebrate a special New Year with a momentous number: the Year Two Thousand.
As we move into a new millennium, many of us have much to be thankful for. Most of the world is at peace. Most of us are better educated than our parents or grandparents, and can expect to live longer lives, with greater freedom and a wider range of choices.
A new century brings new hope, but can also bring new dangers — or old ones in a new and alarming form.
Some of us fear seeing our jobs and our way of life destroyed by economic change. Others fear the spread of bigotry, violence or disease. Others still are more worried that human activities may be ruining the globalenvironment.https://www.google.com/search?q=I+hope+the+United+Nations+will+ever+remain+the+supreme+forum+of+peace+and+justice%2C+the+authentic+seat+of+freedom.+More+than+ever+before+in+human+history%2C+we+share+a+common+destiny.+We+can+master+it+only+if+we+face+it+together.&oq=I+hope+the+United+Nations+will+ever+remain+the+supreme+forum+of+peace+and+justice%2C+the+authentic+seat+of+freedom.+More+than+ever+before+in+human+history%2C+we+share+a+common+destiny.+We+can+master+it+only+if+we+face+it+together.&aqs=chrome..69i57.1215j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8nton which our life depends.”
