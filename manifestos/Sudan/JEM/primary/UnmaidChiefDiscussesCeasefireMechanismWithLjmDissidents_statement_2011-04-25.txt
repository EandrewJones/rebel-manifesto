(DOHA) —The dissident faction of the Liberation and Justice Movement (LJM) discussed in Doha on Saturday with the head of the peacekeeping mission (UNAMID) the establishment of a ceasefire commission as provided in a truce agreement signed in March 2010.The rebel faction claimed the removal of their leader El-Tijani El-Sissi last week and accused him of monopolizing the decision-making process. They also said he neglected the establishment of a mechanism to monitoring theceasefire on the ground.The group also said committed to the Doha peace process and all what is agreed by the LJM negotiating team with the government during the peace process which is on the verge to conclude its works. The mediation plans to hand a draft peace agreement to the parties on 27 April.Abdallah Mursal, a member of the breakaway faction and former LJM spokesperson, said that Ibrahim Gambari told them that they failed in the past to reach the persons designated by the rebel group since last year.“Gambari stressed that he would start, in the coming days, to implement the cease-fire mechanism and requested our cooperation with him in this respect,” said Mursal who added they gave him all the details to reach the commander in chief of the LJM forces Ali Karbino who is among the splinters.Mursal said Gambari pledged to deal with them as long as they are committed to the peace process. the new LJM faction claims that El-Sissi has no troops on the ground under his direct command.In a meeting held with LJM leader on 21 April, Gambari discussed the ceasefire with the rebel group which rejected all the explanations formulated by the head of the UNAMID saying he has to assume the responsibility of delaying the ceasefire mechanism.Last week, another dissident leading member of the rebel group, Mahgoub Hussein, welcomed the recent dissidence and called on the mediation and the government delegation to stop dealing with the JLM leader El-Sissi.He further accused Sissi of establishing direct contacts with the government and the opposition Umma Party, to which he belonged in the past.The former governor of Darfur region, El-Sissi was approached to lead the coalition of different groups to represent the largest ethnic group, Fur tribe. His choice was motivated by the refusal of Sudan Liberation Movement leader, Abdel wahid Al-Nur, to join the Doha peace process. Nur belongs to the same tribe.(ST)
