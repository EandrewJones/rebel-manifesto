URGENT ACTIONJOURNALIST DETAINED, AT RISK OF TORTUREADDITIONAL INFORMATIONFaisal Mohammed Salih is a prominent journalist from Sudan and the director of Teeba Press, an NGO working to train journalists. In the past ten years, he has written extensively on Sudan, notably for Al-Akhbar, Al Adwa and Al Shahid. In March 2011, he faced charges of criminal defamation and was accused of ruining the reputation of the NISS for reporting on the rape of Safia Ishaag, an activist, by NISS agents.A raft of new tactics are being used to silence journalists in Sudan in a crackdown by Khartoum’s authorities dating from the start of uprisings in North Africa in January 2011, Amnesty International said in a new briefing released on World Press Freedom Day.
