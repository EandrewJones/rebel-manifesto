vigil for murdered Sudanese fathersSunday, 6/17/12, 9:30 – 10:15ampray with Reverend Herbert DaughtrySudan Mission, East 42 Street at 2nd Avenue, Manhattan
Reverend Herbert Daughtry will be holding a prayer vigil at the Sudan Mission on Father’s Day (Sunday, 6/17) to honor all of the fathers murdered by Sudan government forces.
The vigil only will last for 45 minutes so, especially for the cab drivers who are on duty in Manhattan, you can participate easily without using a lot of your time.
Reverend Daughtry is an elderly man, and he will be bringing his family and members of his Brooklyn Christian church.
If they can take their time to travel to the Sudan Mission, you can show respect by joining them.
Remember. Sunday is the American “holiday” of “Father’s Day”,so it makes sense to stand vigil on Father’s Day for fathers who have been killed in Sudan.
