Although the ruling regime of the deposed Omer al-Bashir and his corrupt government went to extermination, the legacy continued to be heavy for the people of Sudan, especially the daily difficulties of living especially in the wake of the pandemic conditions of the renewed COVID -19, the Virus that quarantined the entire world’s population.

A year of political upheaval inSudan
“WE ARERevolutionaries,AND Revolutionaries! We will complete the journey!” thousands chanted in Freedom Square, which protesters took over in theCapital Khartoum in July and where Bashir held a big rally in his last months in power.
Others chanted: “Our martyrs have not died, they live with the revolutionaries!”

Thus, and at last, today, the eleventh Saturday, April, 2020 is the day that made Omer Al-Bashir and his group say that they will remain in power forever in the rule of Sudan and there is no being who can remove them has been proved beyond doubt that it is a lie that the world has heard and as well seen.And it was really for the people of Sudan to celebrate had it not the outbreak of Pandemic conditions of the Coronavirus aka COVID -19, which locked the nations of the world inside the home as a protection against this deadly disease.
Nevertheless, we feel over the moon, as they say, that the Génocidaire Omer Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir and his criminal entourage are no longer the rulers for the Sudanese Nation.However, the legacy left by the Islamists is heavy, but the people of Sudan, the makers of Revolutions and the overthrow of dictatorships, deserve the cleanliness of their country from the remains of the dirt of the thirty odd years thatBashir andhis cortège have left.We chantshouting withthe loudestVoices,LONG LIVEtheStruggle of the SudanesePeople.We will build our country Sudan withthehighestdetermination, despite the existence of the threeGiants,Poverty,Disease andCorruption.The Sudanese Public will be the Victor at the end of the day despitethe presence of side battles, raised by some political partieswho have becomeaddictsofAuthority,keeping racing andrunning after themirage of authority!
